    "content": "Hi! Crosspost from /r/sex because I wasn\u2019t sure of the right subreddit for this. Let me know if this breaks any rules, just looking for advice.\n\nI\u2019m 23 and suffered from a pretty violent sexual assault when I was 17 years old. Part of it involved pretty brutal oral sex. For some reason, this didn\u2019t really cause this problem for me until recently. \n\nI now have a boyfriend of about 2 months and we have a great sex life. He asked me to suck his dick once when I was drunk and I obliged but absolutely panicked while it was happening and had flashbacks to my assault. I played it off well and said I was just too drunk and he didn\u2019t mind and we had sex. \n\nSince that experience, I\u2019m now absolutely terrified to give him oral sex out of fear of the same thing happening. At this point, I think I\u2019ve psyched myself out and know it will definitely happen if I attempt. He has never asked or pressured me to do it since, so I haven\u2019t. However, I feel like I\u2019m failing him and I\u2019m sure he would like me to do it. \n\nI\u2019ve considered telling him about what happened to me in the past as an explanation for why I haven\u2019t sucked his dick at all throughout our 2 months of being intimate apart from that first time which lasted probably 3 minutes. I just don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m selfish.. BUT I am trying to mentally talk myself into doing it again. I\u2019m worried that if I tell him about this, he won\u2019t be able to enjoy it and will be worried about my comfort level the whole time. \n\nI also feel so stupid because it was 6 years ago at this point and I should be over it. I just feel inadequate and embarrassed and am unsure how to proceed. I\u2019m seeing him tomorrow and am on my period. Seems like a natural time for me to perform oral sex since we probably won\u2019t have sex, but I\u2019m just panicking about it. I know he won\u2019t put any pressure on me to do anything sexual, but I want to please him. \n\nShould I tell him or continue to ignore the situation since he hasn\u2019t brought it up? Any guidance is appreciated! ",

    "content": "This is my first my first reddit post and I just created this account because I really need to tell someone about this. \n\nI just watched Leaving Neverland, the Michael Jackson documentary, and hearing those guys talk about what they went through really stirred up some memories and feelings for me. After the first episode I had to lock myself in the bathroom for a while. I was shaking and I had to throw up. Still went back to watch the second episode though, I couldn\u2019t stop watching. Now I feel like bursting, I have to tell someone what happened to me. \n\nI was sexually abused by my father for about 10 years. I am 21 now. My very earliest memories are of him molesting me. It\u2019s pretty much all I remember from my early years. And the few good memories I have of my childhood are all tainted by the bad stuff that happened. He molested me, performed oral sex on me and forced me to lick and suck his penis before I was old enough to understand any of it. This started when I was very young, as I said these are my earliest memories. The last memory I have of it happening was when I was maybe 11 years old. I remember reading an educational children\u2019s book about the body when I was about 8 years old and reading a chapter about puberty. I got scared that my father might actually rape me when I got old enough and that I would become pregnant with his child. I couldn\u2019t sleep and I was afraid that he would come into my bedroom at night. I thought about the ceiling caving in and crushing me to death, and the thought of that comforted me. \n\nI could\u2019ve stopped it but I never did anything, I just let it happen. I\u2019m as bad, if not worse, than he is. I\u2019ve never really told anyone about this. I think I\u2019ve blurted it out once or twice when I was drunk, but always laughed it off and claimed I was kidding. My mother doesn\u2019t know a thing and she can never know. She would kill herself. I still talk to my father and I\u2019ve actually always liked him. We have a lot in common and I am still, to this day, very desperate for him to like me and be proud of me. Why can\u2019t I just hate him? What\u2019s wrong with me? I feel disgusting and I think this was all my fault. Somehow I deserved what happened to me. I\u2019m not allowed to complain, I only have myself to blame. Disgusting, filthy, worthless girl. \n\nToday I suffer a lot from mental illness. I\u2019m bipolar and I have BPD. I\u2019ve tried to kill myself before and I still fantasise about that often. I got stuck in drug abuse and prostitution when I was 18, but I got out of that. My friends and family are mad at me for those things. They don\u2019t understand how I, a seemingly sweet and smart girl, could get caught up in those things. How stupid and selfish could I be? Why would I kill myself when I\u2019ve had such a good life? I play dumb and act like I have no idea how all that happened. Teenage hormones and meeting bad people. Bad luck and being young and stupid, that\u2019s what I tell my friends/family. I can\u2019t exactly tell them that I was abused and feel disgusting, worthless and long to punish myself and die. \n\nI am convinced that I\u2019ll never find love. Who could ever put up with this? I\u2019m horrible and rotten. I\u2019m not sure how to explain it but I feel as though my blood is thick and black like some disgusting, toxic syrup. My heart feels physically heavy and as if there\u2019s a big eagle sitting on top of it, burying its talons into it and ripping it apart. My skeleton feels frozen and harsh, like metal in a cold winter if you know what I mean? But it also feels fragile like a butterfly wing. If you touch me it will shatter and I will fall to pieces. Sorry, that sounds ridiculous and pathetic. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m posting this... I\u2019m just sad and so so tired of carrying this around. I wonder how long it will take before the weight will crush me. Sort of like how I wish the ceiling would fall and crush me when I was a child. \n\nI am sorry for bothering you. And I am sorry for saying sorry. \n\n",

    "content": "So this is my first ever reddit post, i\u2019ve seen a lot how the community can help people with problems. So I (24m) am in a happy long distance relationship with (23f). She\u2019s across the country and we do a good job of communicating and seeing each other once a month. Before we became official I was talking to several women, once we became official, I\u2019ve told those women explicitly that I am no longer interested and have a gf now. Most respected it and we put boundaries on our friendship. One of those women (22 f) who I should\u2019ve completely cut off openly stated she respected the boundaries but her actions did not support this. I knew this and stopped talking to her for months, after she convinced me she had changed I let her back in my life with boundaries. We typically never seen each other alone, and always kept it cordial. One night I threw a party at my house and invited several people over including her. I had a lot to drink and she did as well. I usually am very good with my liquor but tonight with me being at home I felt safe, something was off though because I was very inebriated to the point where I could not do much for myself. i\u2019ve never felt that way before and I knew this was not good for me so i went in my room and went to sleep. She later came in the room while I was sleep and i woke up to her trying to give me oral sex, I told her no and forcefully pushed her off of me, told her to leave and i went back to sleep. I later woke up to her being on top of me, by this point all of my clothes are off and sad to say my little friend has a mind of his own. for context, yes I am attracted to this girl but I did not want this and repeatedly refused her advances. thankfully I had enough strength to stop it, as I try to go to sleep I do not remember much after that but waking up a little less drunk later on in the night with us both being naked in the bed. as a guy it\u2019s hard to even consider this happening to you, but i had nothing else to believe. i\u2019ve repeatedly told her no and for her to go against my request and proceed, i felt inferior. Something that I would never wish on anyone, part of me blames myself for even putting myself in the situation or how my penis could even get up in that situation. I don\u2019t remember every detail of that part of the night but i think I came in her just based on stains in the bed. waking up and realizing what might have happened I demanded she leave which she did, after that I tried to brush is off but it still haunts me. she apologized and credited it to being drunk, but that meant nothing to me. i\u2019m afraid to tell anyone because how can i as a man let this happen to me, why am i dumb enough to even have this person in my life. Realizing the worst possible outcome of what could\u2019ve happened, i urged her to get a morning after pill, hoping that it would tie any loose ends that could\u2019ve resulted from the night, but me unsure if i even finished, just thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask her to get one. thinking that my nightmare was over I quickly blocked her and hoped never to hear from her again. I never brought the incident up with my girlfriend as it would create a huge rift in our relationship. fast forward 3 weeks later she texts me that she\u2019s pregnant and will keep the child and that there is no way she will not. what do I do? how can this happen. what rights as a man do I have for this? is this even illegal?",
