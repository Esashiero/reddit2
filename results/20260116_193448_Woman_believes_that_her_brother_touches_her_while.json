    "content": "Title might be too harsh but give it a read and suggest. It's gonna be a long one so bear with me. TL;DR at the end.\n\nIt's about my friend (F25) who apparently has a crush on me (M25). We both worked in the same city for almost 2 years and at the start of this year, I left the city and as I was the only one with whom she used to hangout as a friend, she left alone. I already made her clear that I see her as nothing but more than a good friend but she also made it clear that she can't suppress her feelings but she won't bring her feelings in between our friendship.\n\nNow cut to the main point. As she left alone, my friend/roommate (M25) started hanging out with her more often now. We all used to hangout together when I was in that city and they both thought of each other as siblings. She even tied Rakhi to him for 3 years now (including this year). After I left the city, they started hanging out to the point where they started going to movies every weekend (Yeah, Saturdays and Sundays) outings, every night tea breaks, daily going for a walk and talking on phones during odd hours, this and that... It has continued for like 6-7 months now.\n\nShe used to talk to me not everyday but occasionally as our preference. She used to tell me how she is going with him everyday and what they are planning to do now etc etc...\n\nSlowly it started turning to something else. My roommate started nagging/scolding her if she talked with any other boy. Whenever she spoke with me, he even scolded her like \"why are you talking with him when you are with me?\" But, she got angry and scolded him saying \"who are you to stop me from talking with him?\". She only stood up for herself here cuz it was me. But then if she spoke with someone else and if he came to know about it, then again he started scolding her and she started distancing herself from everyone because of him.\n\nEven my roommate did the same. There was a girl who used to like him and even confessed about it. He distanced himself from that girl and gave all his time to her and expected the same from her and he kind of started demanding it.\n\nWhenever she told me about this, I was like \"he's like your brother and he doesn't have any friends there. So he doesn't want you to lose to anyone else. Maybe that's why he's being possessive about it\". If I got some doubt cuz of his actions, I used to brush it off saying he's nothing but her brother. And even she thought of him as Brother only. Nothing more than that.\n\nWhenever she called me, she used to tell me all these things and how he's being childish whenever she talks with someone else and scolds her. Even though she was sick of it and whenever he went over his limits, she even scolded him back saying be in your limits and don't tell me what to do with my life. But, this used to continue every week or two.\n\nSo a week back, my roommate was coming from work (evening shift) and he saw a guy talking over his phone. He's the same guy who he said not to talk to. Then he checked the True caller and saw her on call. Then he started texting her and scolding her why she was talking with him again despite him telling her not to talk to. Btw, she was talking with her mom at that time. Even she got angry and scolded him back and said don't talk to me ever again. \n\nThen, he realised his mistake and tried calling her and tried to apologise over text. Then she called me and told me what happened. I told her this is getting out of hand now, just distance yourself from him and totally avoid him. I told her not to engage with him and talk to him tomorrow and be clear how you don't wanna talk to him and tell him to be in his limits.\n\nThen she started telling me the unthinkable things and the things which I was kinda afraid of. She told me whenever they went outside, he held her hand and even if she tried to remove it, he held her hand tightly. She couldn't say anything as she thought this would make things uncomfortable between them and she went on with it. This happened a few times.\n\nEven, whenever she sweats, he wipes her sweat from his hand and touches her lips. She was uncomfortable and felt weird too but she couldn't say anything as she convinced herself he was doing this as a brother.\n\nA few days back, they went home together on the same train. For my roommate, it's a bit longer route but he insisted on coming with her. During travel she said while sleeping on lower birth, she folded her legs and slept, and at the end of the birth, my roommate was sitting. Then he took her legs and kept it on his thighs and started pressing it like he was massaging her legs. She stopped him but he insisted on doing it. \n\nAfter hearing all this, I was like this is pure harassment man.. just stop it now and distance yourself completely from him. Ik it's difficult to take action during that time as he was someone so close to you but you kinda did allow him to do it. You are equally responsible in this.\n\nThen I told her not to engage with him anymore and just distance yourself completely. But she was like, I'll handle it on my own, he's still like a brother to me. I can't let him be on his own, he's acting crazy these days. If I distance him and he leaves this area then everybody thinks I did something to him and he left. Or what if he does something to him? I can't risk it.\n\nThen I was like, \"Okay, handle it in your way but minimize hanging out with him and if he crosses his limits, stand up for yourself. Don't be afraid of anything\".\n\nThen she reduced talking with him and hanging out with him. And now, the day before yesterday again they went to a movie and she told me about it. I was like, \"seriously? After all this?\". Then she said he was in his limits during all our time together. He didn't do anything to me. Maybe he changed. But still I'll be careful and keep him in his limits and I won't give him the lenience he needs.\n\nI was speechless. What fears me is, after all this happened, overnight she changed her opinion on him and he again got her good side (kind of). I'm lost here.. \n\nSo please can you guys tell me how to convince her from staying away from him or am I wrong here to interfere in their matter? I'm only doing this because I think this is purely harassment and she doesn't even realise this.\n\n\u2705 TL;DR:\n\nMy female friend (F25) had a crush on me (M25), but I made it clear I only see her as a friend. After I moved away, she started spending a lot of time with my male roommate (M25), who she considered a brother and even tied Rakhi to him. Over time, he became possessive, scolded her for talking to other people, and crossed boundaries like holding her hand tightly, touching her lips, and massaging her legs without consent. I advised her to distance herself, but she still wants to help him and believes she can handle it. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s harassment and want advice on how to convince her to stay away without overstepping.",

    "content": "\nI don\u2019t know exactly how to begin\u2026this is something that has haunted me for years. \n\nSo sorry if the story ends up confusing. \n\nWhen I was little (5 F ) my father became like a father figure to my grandmother's cousin's son P ( 13 M) because he wasn't doing well at school and his mother couldn't control him. I remember him repeating it several times at school and my father screaming at him about it. I don't know what happened to his father, much less why I never met him. but I remember my father spending a lot of money to raise that boy. I know he could never love him like he loved us (me and my brothers) but I remember him taking care of him like a son. But that boy was never interested in any of that...never cared about school or the consequences of his actions. I remember feeling sorry for him when I heard him beg not to be beaten because he failed school again\u2026 Now I just wish my dad had hit him harder. Don't get me wrong...I don't think hitting is educating but this child ruined my life. Even though he was still a child, he was able to touch someone much smaller than him. Me . He offered me sweets in exchange for going into the bathroom with him. I remember him touching me in ways I didn't want to be touched, but he always convinced me it was normal. I was too little to understand what was happening and my tears were rewarded with sweets. After a while my father decided to take him to a boarding school. I didn't see him many after that.  these memories were suppressed by happier ones and I ended up forgetting or so I thought\u2026\n\nWhen I grew up a little more, around 11, the memories came back strongly and I started to move away from everyone. I didn't like being touched. I didn't want anyone to hug me. I closed myself off from the world. I stopped going out so much with my friends at the time and started staying locked in my room. Discovering that books could take me out of this world and introduce me to another. I never told anyone. I never spoke out loud. I kept this shame to myself. I developed social panic and at 15 I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Now I'm 22 and I've never stopped being that scared, lost 11 year old girl. Everyone asked me why I couldn't feel good, why I never looked complete. But I couldn't say it. I never had the strength to say. \n\nI never had a boyfriend. I can't stand men's looks and when I feel like they want something more I feel like vomiting. I don't have many friends, I can't hold a conversation and there are days when I'm afraid to leave the house. I can't concentrate on anything...I feel like an empty shell. \n\nLast year I saw P (30 M)  after a long time without seeing him. He was married with two children and another on the way. I couldn't look him in the eye and I don't know how I managed to stand there and listen to him talk like everything was fine. I froze and my eyes could only follow him around the house. I couldn't say a single word that day. \n\nThe thing is that everything that P have is thanks to my father. The house, the car, the trips, the job. My father gave him everything. \nP also has a special child, who needs expensive medicine and doctors that my father also pays. I didn't want to destroy his wife's life, much less his children's...so I didn't say anything. \n\nBut this year was the hardest for me, I thought about taking my life several times. I'm tired of feeling pain, I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of begging for tomorrow to be better. Today I'm just a machine. programmed and with tasks to accomplish. However, I feel defective\u2026 with a rusty part.\n\nI can't stand it anymore. Last week I finally told my therapist. I only said what happened to me twice in my life. the first time I was sad and too drunk to hold my tongue and told my best friend\u2026the second was in the therapy . I can't take this secret anymore. It's eating me  away  and destroying my life. I feel trapped and I can't move forward. I want to tell. I feel ready to share. So I did. I told my parents. After discussing with my therapist what would be the best way to approach the subject, I felt confident. After therapy I waited two days to make sure I was ready. It was night when I decided. I took a shower crying and tried to clean my face but I couldn't stop crying. but I couldn't give up. I called my mother first and told her. She was calm and hugged me the entire time. She said it was okay and I didn't need to be ashamed . P who should be ashamed of what he did. We hugged until she went to call my dad. He was also calm and very quiet. After a while of staring into space he finally looked at me and  said he would always be by my side and that we would deal with this together from now on. I cried myself to sleep that night. I knew there was no going back. \n\nMy parents are very nice and playful, but I know they take things like this very seriously. \nI could hear them whispering around the house for the next few days. Anger in their  words. \n\nAfter a while they asked me what I wanted to do with P. I couldn't answer.  So they left it alone. \n\nbut today I talked to my father, he is going to travel for work and will probably meet P since he works at my father's company. He told me that my mother has never been so angry in her life and she wants to ruin P  life. My father asked what I wanted again.\n\nI do not know what to answer. I don't know if I'll be able to live knowing that I destroyed a family and that those children probably won't have the opportunity at life that they could have had if I had kept my mouth shut. but I'm already on my last breath, my last strength, I let these last years ruin me\u2026my life\u2026and I must admit I feel lighter now that I told them. \n\nSo Reddit I\u2019m the asshole if I let my parents take revenge for me  ?",

    "content": "Am I wrong for the sexual touching from my brother because I refuse to wear undergarments? This was from 2 years ago. He put my feet on his penis while I was sleeping. I was shocked when it happened and kept trying to move my legs away from him, and he tried to move them to his penis. We slept together when my cousin came over because there was no space to sleep. I confronted him, and he just went silent and refused to say sorry. I didn't really tell my parents because I didn't want any drama, and I cared about my brother and asked him to change. I recently read his Discord, and I found out he told his friend he touched my breast while I was asleep, and while my family was traveling, he took some woman's bra and did sexual acts on it. He also wastes the water bill by jerking off in the bathroom with the phone. I finally told my Mum about it, and she said that men are very sexual and would do anything bad to a woman. and cannot control themselves also blamed me for not wearing undergarments and not covering myself. I am 19. I wear just a thick T-shirt and men's short pants, nothing sexual. I am flat. I hate wearing undergarments because it would leave a scar and cause my bottom part to be extremely itchy. When my mother confronted my brother, My brother told my mum the reason he did that was because I watch bad stuff like Yaoi and porn. Despite reading that, I would never touch anyone because that's fucking wrong. My mother blames me for the fact that I watched and read that. She says that's why because I attract them, change the subject, say that watching gay people is wrong, and say I am the same as or worse than my brother because I read those things. But this fucker had touched me and done something to some innocent woman's bra and never said sorry for those things. I don't know what else he touched when I was asleep. He is 17, and at that age, you have the fucking brain to think that's fucking wrong. Also, my family is Muslim, and my mother tells me that my actions and what I wear make me cheap and attract people to fuck me, despite what I wear being just a casual t-shirt and short pants. He did, in fact, get punished for it, but it was no more playing games and the internet; he was using my uncle's laptop, and I told my mum to stop it since it's no punishment. She asks what he is going to do, or he will be very bored. What is the point of a punishment when you're not being punished? So am I wrong for all of this, and is it my fault for refusing undergarments? Also, I am ex-Muslim.",

    "content": "hi, I'm looking for advice about this issue im facing with CPTSD.\n\nTLDR: csa, ptsd, ocd and severe anxiety issues. my childhood trauma has made it hard to hold down a job or schooling, and made me self isolate from friends a lot. Want to move out and saving towards it, but currently still living with perpetrator - we do not talk at all. parents do not believe me.\n\nI'm a 19yr old female, from what I can remember at the current moment I experienced sa during the time I was 7/8 up until 12/13. I'm aware these things are choppy and hard to recall, as for the last few years l've uncovered more incidents of it at different ages. I'm currently seeking therapy for ocd and ptsd, as I have developed heavy anxiety and depression as a result and looking to pursue victim counseling soon. Growing up me and the perpetrator were very close, often isolating me from my other family members and friends. We shared a bed until I was 14~ and I recall many incidents of waking up without my clothes on, or being touched in private areas, sharing a shower even when I was 13~, and full on r*. I recall being placed on top of them, being touched almost every night as I slept intimately as a 7 year old, and being fed explicit content regularly. I knew it wasn't normal, but I didn't know it was wrong. It was as though it was a \"little secret\". At the time I felt distress and often said no, or pretended to be asleep. The perpetrator is my older sibling who at the time when I was 6-7, would\u2019ve been 18. There's a lot of detail I won't go into, but this has caused major issues in my immediate life. I recall knowing about it when I was 7/8, but until I was 13/14 I hadn't thought back on it at all. My memories of how I felt are all almost gone, but I recall around 14 starting to gain consciousness about everything. I always had poor memory but I think around that time I began becoming aggressive and avoidant towards them, choosing to sleep in a bed with my parents instead most nights. Up until I was 18 l was unable to sleep in the dark or alone my whole life, and I think that was caused by this behaviour. When I was 17 I came out with it to a friend, as my attendance and performance at school was dropping, and that led to me accessing therapy for anxiety. I eventually told the therapist, and they contacted police and authorities to my home. This broke up my family and I was forced to tell my parents everything. I didn't want this at the time, l wanted to just keep it away from them but it was law so it was alright. As a kid, I knew I had to tell my parents but I was scared of how it would hurt them given our pre existing struggles w finances and home life, and I wanted to protect them from the stress and thought it was better off not. I knowingly kept something like this a secret for a decade at that point because I was in fear of how they'd be hurt by it and how we couldn't survive if this happened. This led to the main issue I'm facing at the moment - moving out. I want to care for my family, my mother is experiencing early signs of dementia, despite being almost 60. I assume it\u2019s because of stress and our financial situation, working multiple jobs for as long as I can remember.  As much as I care and worry for her - holding her hand as she walks, buying things for the house, paying rent and bills etc. I can\u2019t help but hold a sense of hatred as every time I talk to her she mentions I should give some food to (that person), even though ive told her about the situation. My dad, older siblings, all work hard or don\u2019t work at all due to their own mental issues. I assume it\u2019s because of some sort of bad gene etc. I want to move out, but I also feel intense grief towards losing more of the childhood I already lost and don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m really close with my elder brother and he\u2019s previously offered to move out with me but things aren\u2019t working out with money and he hasn\u2019t brought it up since. I\u2019m working towards saving a lot more and have a good paying job for my age that works with schooling and friend offering to move with me, the plan is set and I\u2019m just waiting a few more months for this to work out. I\u2019ve been seeing psychiatrists and therapy regularly for 3 years (have been on meds since etc.) and waiting for victim counselling soon and acknowledgement payment. My main issue I want advice on is how to manage this situation, handle leaving this trauma and living situation, and how to move forward. I\u2019m very confident in my plans, it\u2019s just the emotional detachment and change of environment I\u2019m scared of, especially leaving behind what feels like my entire life if I move. I know I won\u2019t want to return, and the change is so scary to even think about and makes me panic. I already don\u2019t remember much of my life at all, especially of my older brother, and I\u2019m afraid if I leave it will hurt more to lose what could have been more years of making up that lost memory. I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve been distant from friends (all low maintenance friendships , very supportive) and panic at not matching their energy in messages etc due to work and mental issues, and as a result have isolated myself from them a lot. I\u2019m afraid of moving out with them for this reason. I live in an area where living alone even with student accommodation is not affordable. This was hard for me to write and took a while to face as it\u2019s triggering, but I\u2019ve realized through therapy I\u2019m still in this trauma and living with it daily and it\u2019s hard to keep stable and not give up. This page has helped me a lot, looking forward to any words of encouragement or guidance thanks so much for reading. Sorry if any of this is unreadable, it\u2019s hard for me to go back and read it all and make it clearer. Not sure if I went too in detail, please read with care,  take care of yourself. \u2764\ufe0f",

(also im so sorry about all the inappropriate and transphobic comments, i dont support that)\n\nalso in seventh grade i started to get panic attacks whenever she would come pick me up from school. i would just always be in a state of being super anxious with her for some reason. i also get anxious when i think about her and the situation and people often remind me of her and i often spiral about it and things like that\n\nedit: i originally didnt put this in my post since it wasn\u2019t completely clear to me if this was her intention but i was once watching a show with her on her computer and she left the room and told me specifically not to leave that tab and since i was 11 i left the tab to go to photo booth and take a picture bc i love taking photos on her phone and wanted to on her computer as a joke but there was a video of her having sex with her boyfriend in some hotel on it. but again i don\u2019t really know if she wanted me to see that. she never touched me or showed me anything on her body",

    "content": "This happened a few years ago, I haven't told anyone except my best friend.\n\nmy (at the time 9f) cousin (at the time 10m) used to talk to me about some of his female classmate's bodies in a sexual way. He was very exposed to porn and he said his father knew about it.  I didn't like this and it made me uncomfortable, I told him to stop speaking to me about these things but he didn't. He said I was his 'secret keeper' and made me swear not to tell. Then he started making sexual comments about my body. Then asked me to be his girlfriend. Of course, I said no. In our culture, it's ok for cousins to date and get married later, but it's usually because of parent's choice. He said it's ok everyone does this when they're older, I said no. He told me to just try it out and if I don't like it he won't pressure me. I still said no. He left it at that. Then we were playing a game with his younger siblings, and he decided to kidnap me as part of the game. so we were alone, and he put tape on my mouth and he started kissing me with the tape between our lips. I tried to push him off but he wouldn't budge.  then he said it's fine it's just a game, and he convinced me not to tell my parents. I told him ok but I don't want to play this game anymore and he agreed. then the next time we met, he spoke to me about being in a relationship again, and again I said no. Then he pushed me against the wall and kissed me, saying that I had to try it out first before I said no. he said that everyone does this and it's fine. Again I didn't tell my parents. this happened 4 more times before he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend now that I tried it, and I said no, so he actually left me alone and never did it again. He stopped joking with me or playing together or anything we used to do, which made me kinda sad since we were basically siblings. But I was glad that I wasn't forced to kiss him every week. I started to avoid physical touch, and I didn't want my mom to sleep beside me in my room so we wouldn't touch, which annoyed her for some reason. I never told her or my dad though, and I'm not willing to. I was fine for years after this happened and I acted normally around everyone, including my cousin. now it's years later and I'm terrified of people touching me in public, even if it's accidental. I have panic disorder (not entirely because of this but I think this is one of the main reasons why), and it's really affecting my life. I go to therapy but I'm too embarrassed to tell my therapist, and I think it's too late to tell anyone. I did tell my best friend a few weeks ago, though. Is it normal for me to be scared of people years later? Does this even count as rape? What should I do now?\n\nSorry for the bad grammar.",

Anyway, I have known since I could comprehend anything that I have to take care of my mother and not the other way around. I lost my whole childhood taking care of my mother. Thankfully she can talk normally and walk but she\u2019s still extremely weak and she\u2019s got a lot of mental issues with being extremely gullible and things like bipolar,depression. When I was younger she was nice with a side of physical abuse but for the past 5 years she\u2019s been stuck on angry mode, paired with OCD and extreme emotional abuse. She\u2019s tried abusing me but I protect myself now so she stopped. When I don\u2019t make my bed in the morning she calls the cops on me and lies that I physically abuse her. She literally starts bawling her eyes out to the cops on the phone then looks at me and smiles. I hate that I have some love for her but she\u2019s not even a mother to me I take care of her out of obligation I hate her so much\n2. I was molested for 5 years straight, twice a week. This happened from the ages of 4-9, I know that people think that\u2019s too young to remember things but my memories are very clear from those ages, especially during the abuse. It was a fellow doctor and one of my dad\u2019s closest friends. He used to come every other day to take care of me and my brother while my mom was at physical therapy. My relationship with my father is so horrible that when it was happening I didn\u2019t tell anyone because for the first time in my life I felt special and I didn\u2019t want it to go away because I would just go back to being ignored. I told my dad about it finally when I was in 8th grade, he didn\u2019t care and was on his phone the whole time. He to this day does not believe me and constantly talks to my abuser and flaunts it in front of my face. \n3. I was the forgotten daughter and was constantly physically abused by my older brother. This was not sibling fights, it started when I was very young with my brother slapping and punching me. Then when he got older he started holding me down and beating me. The last time he beat me I was 16 and he was 20, he held my face to the ground and beat it into the hardwood floors and into the walls. My dad knew about every single occurrence because I told him. He didn\u2019t care. My brother is a boy and I\u2019m a girl so it doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s just being a boy. But if I EVER did anything back I was getting beat by my dad and my brother would smugly watch. \n4. I have been physically abused by my dad my entire life. From the ages of 4-10 it was mild, once every few months he would throw his shoe at me full force. From ages 10-14 I was beat every single day, not a single day off. I wasn\u2019t smart and I had undiagnosed ADHD so I wouldn\u2019t finish my schoolwork sometimes. My dad\u2019s doctor friends had daughters who were going to nationals for spelling bee, orchestra, etc and he hated that I wasn\u2019t good enough. It consisted of constant slapping and throwing me onto the ground and kicking me, it usually did not give me bruises. Ages 15-18 covid had started and I went into a very deep depression, I spent every night since middle school crying and wanting to die but now it was more of a \u201cI need to die there\u2019s no other choice\u201d and plotting kind of situation. My grades were the worst they ever were. I started failing things (I was always an A or B student) and that\u2019s when the physical abuse went to an all time high. I was beat for hours. I was kicked out of my room and had to sleep on marble tiles for two years inside of our coat closet. I was hit with shoes,belts,wooden boards, metal bars, etc. I broke two fingers and was covered in bruises during this entire period of my life. \n5. I wasn\u2019t skinny enough in my dad\u2019s mind and he starved me the entirety of middle and high school. Everyday I would come home and get weighed, if I gained even .5 pounds I was beat. There was once a time where I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat food for 6 days. I survived by going through the trash can and eating scraps at 2am. My dad got out of debt and became extremely rich around 7-8th grade so it wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t have it. \n6. Constant emotional abuse by my dad. I could\u2019ve left when I was out of high school to a good college far away (my dad has an education account with 300k in it for me) which was my plan. He guilted me into staying and going to a college 30 minutes away so that I could take care of my mother, because no one else could take care of her like me. He had more than enough money to get a nurse to take care of her but he chose not to. My parents got divorced when I was little but my dad still provides for her because we are Muslim and they got divorced because of a mental issue and other things. In Islam a man can\u2019t just leave his wife if that happens so he takes care of her financially. There was a time where CPS was called because my dad was abusive to my brother as well (not nearly as bad as me) and he reported it. I was guilted into lying to them when I was in middle school. \n7. My brother and I have a very complicated relationship. I love him and I hate him so much. We were close for two singular years but those years were so nice and I have grown to romanticize those years and I forgive him when I shouldn\u2019t. He has so many mental health issues and he has tried to run away so many times. He\u2019s overdosed on cocaine, done so many drugs it\u2019s so bad. He tried to kill himself a few months ago and it was horrible. He lives two hours away and he was missing with a suicide note for two days. It was so horrible I love him and I don\u2019t want him to do that and it\u2019s just been bad in general. I have so much empathy for him because he also had to grow up with our dad and it was horrible and I just don\u2019t know how to feel about it anymore. \n8. My dad is a pedo. I went through his phone two weeks ago and it was so disgusting. He is not actually doing anything illegal it\u2019s just extremely morally bad. He\u2019s turning 60 and he\u2019s telling woman that he\u2019s in his 40s and that they look like beautiful 16 year olds while begging for nudes. He has a wife in a different country(she\u2019s still getting her visa). I found his search history and it\u2019s all \u201c18 year old gets ****** by a rich old man!\u201d It\u2019s so beyond disgusting, no wonder he didn\u2019t care about my sa. He\u2019s hired escorts that are all 20 or 21. His wife is 32. It\u2019s just so disgusting. \n9. Almost every single one of my friends have left me. I don\u2019t know what i did. I know I\u2019m a good friend, like I know I am I\u2019m not just saying that. I am emotional when I need to be, otherwise I\u2019m always known as the funny friend. I drive everyone usually, I will pay for peoples things occasionally. I can have stupid discussions and extremely deep ones, like I know I\u2019m a good friend. I\u2019ve had long 5-8 year friendships just stop texting me and maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re growing up but why is it everyone? Everyone has just forgotten about me, I\u2019m the only one to check in. And I know I\u2019m not overbearing about it either I just don\u2019t know people don\u2019t think I\u2019m interesting enough I guess\n10. I am in my last year of college yet I am treated like a 12 year old. I\u2019m not allowed to do anything, if I want to hang out with my friends it\u2019s a 45 minute fight with my dad and he will text me the entire time that I\u2019m out with them yelling at me. I have a girlfriend and i genuinely bought another phone just to switch my location and be with her. I am so trapped. I had a job and my dad said he wouldn\u2019t pay for my college fees unless I quit (I go to a private college even with my scholarships I pay 10k a semester). My brother has been in college for 8 years and my dad has never questioned continuing paying for his education. I have a 3.6 GPA, I\u2019m in student gov, clubs, accounting student taking the CPA and my brother is 25 with a 1.7 GPA and nothing else. I mean what is that. \n11. I have had constant anger for the past 6 months. This is not me. I am happy and light and funny. I am just so consumed with anger every single minute of the day I hate it so much, I hate myself so much. \n\nI\u2019m sure people who read this will be like \u201cwow she\u2019s so stupid why hasn\u2019t she just left she\u2019s 21\u201d I can\u2019t leave. Who will take care of my mom? My dad will throw money but he will never take care of her, my brother is too selfish. She hates me and is horrible to me yet I  still feel the need to help and provide an area where she can be healthy. I hate her but she\u2019s my mom. Every time I have tried to get money my dad has stopped it and has either taken it away, or made me pay for things to drain my fund. He bought me a Toyota RAV4 XLE 2022 when I went into college. I would like to keep in mind that my dad has never spoiled me, I never got gifts for my birthday and have to provide everything myself. This was the one thing he got me that was nice. He had enough money to pay for the full 39k but instead he paid half and had me pay the monthly payments. Before getting the car I told him that I was perfectly fine with my 2005 Toyota Camry and that I don\u2019t want it if it came with me having to pay myself. He told me not to worry about it then never gave me the money after 4 months. The payment is $400 and as a college student with no job it has drained me.\nAnyway, this felt nice. I needed to rant. I am getting so tired of life. I\u2019m leaving this situation partially as soon as I graduate and get enough money with my big girl job but I will always have to deal with it somewhat because of my mom. This list is maybe like 40% of my trauma but it\u2019s the most important to me. I\u2019m just so tired",

    "content": "I feel so lost and don\u2019t know where to start. I (43F) found out last night that my baby brother (37M), I\u2019ll call him Sam, has 6 months to live max. Sam and I have always been close. Sam has 4 older sisters (me included) and there are 16 years between our oldest sister and Sam. He was there when my daughter was born (military dad was on deployment) and would go with me on base for her doctor appointments. Sam loved her and would put his hats on her and would joke that he would take her to the mall to pick up chicks. He has always been an amazing uncle and brother. \n\nShortly after we ended up stationed on the other side of the country, Sam met his STBX (37F), I\u2019m obviously going to call her the Succubus. When she was 16 she got pregnant and just left the baby with the dad and his mom. Sam and Succubus ended up pregnant at 18/19. They got married while she was pregnant. I hadn\u2019t met her because they got married so quickly. I hoped it worked out and he was over the moon when his daughter was born. It was obvious how much he loved his family. \n\nAfter my divorce, I moved back to our hometown in AK and got a job in the same firm as my mom. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint what it was about her, but something was really off about the Succubus, and by that time they had a son 13 months after their daughter. My brother worked really hard to provide for his family and she wanted to be a SAHM, so he worked hard so she could be with the kids. I noticed how stressed my brother became and I didn\u2019t think it was from parenting because he was a hands on parent; helped change diapers, feed the kids, helped with laundry and dishes. Sam\u2019s job required him to start working at 5:00 am. \n\nOne day the Succubus just left without a word. Took her phone, the car, and some money and I got a call that he needed help. Sam couldn\u2019t miss work and neither could we. We spoke with one of the partners, and were allowed to bring the babies with us (7 month old and 20 month old). Since I was furthest from the conference room, the play pen was set up in my office and my mom, me, and my sister staggered our lunches to each watch the children (my sister came from her office a few blocks away) and I would try and get done what I could until my brother was able to pick them up. The Succubus was gone a full week and never answered her phone, wouldn\u2019t say where she had been, and pretended like nothing ever happened. She slowly stopped cleaning the house at all, and Sam would come home and clean it.\n\nI found out that wasn\u2019t the first time she had done that. One weekend I showed up at their house and the Succubus hadn\u2019t realized I was there yet. I was around the corner from the kitchen and could hear them arguing and her punching him in the arms because she didn\u2019t like what he made for breakfast. For reference, he\u2019s 5\u201911\u201d and the Succubus is 5\u20192\u201d. I immediately walked in and said that if she hit him one more time I was going to hit her and I would make sure she stays down. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d. Needless to say she and I no longer got along, but she couldn\u2019t avoid me because she liked using my parents as free babysitters when she would take off and I was frequently there. My family is actually very close.  We noticed Sam wasn\u2019t as happy as he used to be and had started drinking more. Succubus drank more than him and was a mean drunk. \n\nI moved across country again for a job opportunity. I didn\u2019t get to see Sam and his kids as much as I liked, mostly at our grandma\u2019s and our Dad\u2019s funeral. It was 6 years later when I went to visit Sam and his family (now 4 kids) on the Texas coast. I genuinely had a good time and thought we could put the past behind us. I had been looking to relocate closer to family. I had started making plans to move and was looking for a job closer to Sam. The day before I was going to put in my notice, Sam called me said he\u2019s moving his family immediately to Alaska. I thought WTH? Turns out the Succubus was playing hide the salami with the neighbor while Sam was at work, leaving the kids (all under 10) completely unattended while she was getting the meat and Sam got a paternity test for the youngest child (yes, his). Sam got a vasectomy and told the Succubus for any chance to make it work, they were going to Alaska.  \n\nIt just got worse. The house they bought was next door to the Succubi\u2019s best friend\u2019s BF, I\u2019m calling him Niles, She ended up pregnant by Niles and left Sam. Sam took the kid\u2019s back to Texas and I was trying to help him get a divorce. By that point he had a drinking problem and he admitted that Succubus wanted the kid\u2019s for child support and he didn\u2019t know what to do because his job frequently took him away for days to weeks at a time. Succubus wanted the money Sam could provide without the hassle of actually taking care of her children. I made sure he filed for divorce in Texas so she couldn\u2019t just take the kids out of state without a court order. Nile\u2019s baby, Lyle, was born in January and then the pandemic hit. Succubus took the new baby and ditched all of Sam\u2019s kids so she could make a go with Niles. \n\nMy whole family pitched in as much as we could. Sam was drinking less and the kids were actually doing good. Sam made the mistake of letting Succubus stay at the house so she could see their kids for a week. One night she had been drinking and tried to initiate salami hide-n-go seek with him and he flat out turned her down and that pissed her off. Lyle wanted a bottle and my brother was holding him so he would stop fussing while she made the bottle. She threw the hot bottle at Sam so hard it cut open his eyebrow 1/2 inch while he had been holding the baby. He turned the video on his phone on to record the damage and gave her the option to leave or he would have her arrested. She left and was gone for 6 months. \n\nThe thing I hated the most that my parents pounded into our heads was divorce wasn\u2019t an option. They also hammered in we don\u2019t cheat, but apparently some spouse\u2019s didn\u2019t get that memo. Our parents were married 45 years before our dad passed. I was the only one divorced and it took 3 years to stop feeling embarrassed and like the black sheep to straight up celebrating my divorce-ary. \n\nSam wanted a successful marriage and didn\u2019t want his children to ever feel like they had to choose and didn\u2019t want them to lose their mom. She promised she was done cheating with her fingers crossed behind her back. Sam called off the divorce and let her back in and it was fine for a month. Both of their drinking resumed. Succubus would instigate arguments and over time she would hit and kick him trying to get him to hit her back. He would push her away but he did not hit her. \n\nIn May, Sam got on the family iPad and Succubus left tabs open. She was signed into dating sites and had been sexting Sam\u2019s friend saying she wanted to do it like they did last time. Sam told Succubus he was done and it was over. Succubus pretended to be fine with it, but they were still in the same house. Sam quit drinking and started AA. When Succubus told one of her friends Sam was divorcing her, said friend tried getting Sam to play hide the Salami with her and gave Sam screenshots of her texts with Succubus that showed the non-legal, non-prescription white powders Succubus was enjoying when she went out. No, Sam was not like Arby\u2019s and didn\u2019t give her the meats. \n\nOn Father\u2019s Day Sam wanted to watch a movie with the kids. Succubus called 911 and claimed Sam hit her and the kids. The police arrived and realized succubus lied and filed a report on Sam\u2019s behalf. Sam noticed that his youngest daughter started to become afraid of him and he didn\u2019t know why. When he asked the kids while they were alone, the older 3 told him that Succubus tries to tell them that Sam is abusing them and they need to move with her out of state. \n\nSam immediately called me. We talked in depth about the drinking, cheating, abuse and manipulation of the children. I fully believe that if she thought she could get away with making him cease to exist, she would try it. I didn\u2019t believe she would because she wants the thousands in child support she would get if she got the kids. I purchased cameras and told him to only put them up in the common rooms and not where they point in to the bedrooms or bathrooms. I called my oldest sister who lived closer to Sam and they (sister and BIL) made plans to stay with Sam on the 7/4 weekend. \n\nSuccubus was a nightmare. Succubus took off at midnight and came back at 3 AM drunk and went into Sam\u2019s room, waking him (and everyone else) up and started saying \u201cI know you touched (youngest daughter)!\u201d My sister and BIL stood outside the door listening the entire time. Sam said \u201cYou know I would never do that. Get out.\u201d After 45 minutes she went to pass out in her room.  When everyone got up for breakfast, Sam made pancakes, bacon, eggs, and cut up cantaloupe and everyone but Succubus ate together. \n\nSuccubus got up while Sam was washing the dishes and began loudly telling him she didn\u2019t want to eat what he made and his cooking was Sh1+.  He ignored her and went to set up a game to play with my sister, BIL and the kids. While they were setting up the game they were talking and Succubus charged in wanting to know what they were talking about and if they were talking about her and my sister told her to go away because it\u2019s a private conversation that didn\u2019t involve her. She refused and my sister snapped and told her what crappy person and bad mother she was. They ditched the game and took the kids out for ice cream.\n\nA few days after my sister and BIL left, succubus started tearing down the cameras and tried smashing my BIL\u2019s laptop he loaned Sam. Sam grabbed the laptop and pulled it away from her and she fell, but was fine. Sam took a walk to cool down and got a hotel room for whichever was not going to be with the kids. We found out from the oldest daughter, Lilly , that succubus kept drinking and fell while trying to get into a hammock, landing on her wrist/forearm first causing a massive bruise. She waited 6 hours and then called the police claiming Sam did it. Lilly tried telling the police she was lying and she hurt it while drunk trying to get in the hammock. The Police put a warrant out for Sam\u2019s arrest. Succubus pretended she didn\u2019t call the police and Sam blocked her and I told her all communication to Sam had to go through me. Succubus hated that. Lilly would text me what was going on, and Sam found out Succubus fully drained their bank accounts and then cried to her brother that she had no money. She also drained $1,200 from Lilly\u2019s account too. \n\nLilly texted Sam that Succubus got a camera and she saw her trying to hide it in their bedroom and to not go near the bedroom if Succubus was there.\n\nSuccubus claimed she dropped the charge and wanted to go away for a few days. The Petition for divorce was filed, and this arrangement worked for about 7 weeks. During this time, Sam started to feel run down. He would stay at the house on the weekends and deep clean it because Succubus refused to clean. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Succubus came to the house at midnight while Sam was asleep. Succubus brought a friend with her that stayed on the porch and smoked. Succubus went to Sam\u2019s room trying to initiate hide the salami, and Sam refused. Succubus was furious and started hitting and scratching him. Sam left the bedroom trying to get away from her and moved to the kitchen. Succubus kept trying to scratch his face, and when she scratched him particularly hard and drew blood he jerked and hit her in the face. She immediately called the police.  Succubus\u2019s friend refused to provide a statement to corroborate her story. Lilly tried again to tell them that something was mentally wrong with her mom and her mom was the aggressor and she was always the aggressor. \n\nI told Lilly if she heard fighting to record it and send me the clips. Lilly said during the week the youngest two kids barely went to school. I told her to tell everything to her school\u2019s counselor, and the counselor contacted CPS. CPS told them to go to the police, the police told them go to CPS. \n\nSam said he really wasn\u2019t feeling good and he stayed at the house in bed, and didn\u2019t go to work for an entire week, which he had never done before.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear from Sam like I normally do in the morning, so I texted Lilly asking if everything was okay. She said that Succubus started attacking Sam at 2 AM and yelling that he should kill himself and she was going to hire a hitman to take him out and then she busted out the window of the driver\u2019s side window. Sam immediately left and didn\u2019t take his phone. Lilly said she thought his kidneys were dying. Sam had never mentioned his Kidneys. \n\nLilly then sent me some video and pictures she had taken and told me that Succubus tried taking the phone from her to delete the video and that she was hitting her and trying to pin her down to get it. Lilly managed to push her off and locked herself in her room yelling she would call the police if Succubus didn\u2019t stop. \n\nI put the info in the family chat and we all started calling hotels and hospitals looking for Sam. \n\nI called CPS with everything Lilly told me. They said they would investigate claims involving the children but couldn\u2019t open an adult protective case because Sam wasn\u2019t 65 and hadn\u2019t been sick long enough. \n\nAt 5 PM, I got a text from Sam\u2019s phone. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was him or Succubus pretending to be him so I asked for a picture of his face while flipping me off. I have never seen him look so sick. It took a few hours, but Sam finally admitted he was told he had 6 months at most left. I told him they could be wrong. He had it confirmed at 2 different hospitals. He\u2019s known for a month. \n\nI asked what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to protect his kids. He wants them to go to me. Apparently CPS started investigating after the July incident and Succubus has missed drug testing 4 times now. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want anyone to know. He felt like a failure because he spent so much of his life with a woman so horrible that couldn\u2019t love him at all. I told him it can\u2019t stay quiet for long especially if I have to go to court for custody of the kids. Lilly called at 11 pm saying her mom attacked her again and took her phone and she ran and her brother called the police. Succubus started to leave and went for her car only for Lilly to yell that she was just going to tell the police her license plate, so Succubus ran from the yard. \n\n Astonishingly, the police never showed up. My sister was three hours closer and beat me there. She called our mom and gave her an update and our mom showed up an hour after I did. They now both know how much time he has. I took my niece to the police station and she filed a report and said she wanted to press charges. The kids don\u2019t know how sick he is and neither does Succubus. He doesn\u2019t want her to know at all. \n\nI told my niece that I would be trying to get custody of all of them and she was relieved. \n\nI don\u2019t want any of this to be true. Sam and I had been talking about what we could do in the future and I had told him that when all the kids were older I wanted to take him to Germany and show him around. I know we will never get to do that with how bad his condition is and there\u2019s so much he will miss from his children\u2019s lives and they all deserved better than this. ",

I won\u2019t be super specific because the situation itself could make it obvious, but When we were around our pre teen years I was sexually assaulted by her older brother(of age, to which I was still a minor). I would like to specify now that I\u2019m sure she would have acted differently now and this was a past thing and I am just having trouble coping with what happened now. That being said when I told her the next morning she told me not to tell my parents to which I didn\u2019t because I trusted she wouldn\u2019t let it happen again, which it did not. Fast forwarding a few weeks, I was sent to a different school for a short period of time, and our mutual friend had gone with me a few weeks after my arrival. I was happy to have a friend but the topic of sexual assault was brought up and I ended up telling her what happened between me and my best friends brother. To which we talked about it and ect. and that was the end. Until the summer was about to end, I had to move to a city pretty far from where I was originally and the second girl had told my best friend that I had told her, her brother full fledged r-ed me. I DID NOT tell her that. Which I believe shouldn\u2019t have mattered and if anything would make it worse for him, but I digress. They told me there was no way that could\u2019ve happened to me in the small house we were in. I had tried to tell her I never said that and he didn\u2019t even r**e me, he had pulled my pants down and started touching me while I was asleep until I woke up. And I had TOLD HER THAT. But in the end she believed I was a liar and she dropped me. A few months after this and I had settled in to my new town, she texted saying she missed me and us and we became best friends again and then everything went back to normal. But it hasn\u2019t been for me and it hasn\u2019t been that way in a really long time. I didn\u2019t lie, I just needed support and I was shunned.

That's what I was supposed to think.\n\n*Exhibit A: The Cousin*\n\nHe was my brother's age. I thought of him as a brother. That's important. Write that down.\u00a0*I thought of him as a brother*. Which means what happened next shouldn't have a name, but it does.\n\nOne day,out of nowhere, out of nothing,he cornered me.\n\nI made him leave. I sat in front of the TV. I don't remember what I watched. I don't remember what I thought. The detective in me notes: suspicious\u00a0*blank space in memory.*\u00a0The body remembers what the mind refuses.\n\n*Exhibit B: The Dreams*\n\nThe next day: fine. I felt nothing. See? Nothing happened.\n\nBut then,the dreams. Door after door after door. Running. Breathing heavy. Someone chasing me. Something chasing me.\n\nNight two: the someone has a face. It's him.\n\nI couldn't sleep for days after that. Clue:\u00a0*the body knew before I did. It neither forgave nor forgive but the mind may have.*\n\n*Exhibit C: The Mother*\n\nI told my mother. She was devastated. But here's where the case gets complicated:\n\nShe didn't want me to tell anyone else. Not his wife,who loved him deeply, stupidly, completely. Not the family. He was a close relative, you see. That matters more than,well. Than me, apparently.\n\nEvidence of unfairness, first incident: I was fourteen. This was the first time I understood that fairness is a lie we tell children.\n\nMy mother created a dispute between him and his mother. Clever. But he still came to family gatherings. He was still\u00a0*welcome*. His mother stopped talking to us, but\u00a0*he*\u00a0was still there. Still in front of me.\n\n*Exhibit D: The Body Keeps Score*\n\nAfter that, I noticed things:\n\n1 I didn't want to go anywhere\n\n2 I didn't like anyone's touch. Anyone. My mother. My father. My brothers.\n\n3 One day my brother put his hand on my shoulder and I felt it again,that feeling. I turned. Not him. But my body didn't care what I knew consciously.\n\nPattern recognition:\u00a0*Every man around me wants something from me*. Is this delusion or pattern recognition? The detective can't tell anymore.\n\n*Exhibit E: The Professor*\n\nCollege. A professor who talked very sweetly to me. I watched him. Gathered evidence. He only talked to the fair, pretty girls. Not the dark-skinned ones. Not the ones he deemed unworthy of his attention.\n\nI dissected his teaching. Made him question it. Tried to make his life hell.\n\nI succeeded, partially.\n\nBut I still didn't feel safe.\n\n*Exhibit F: The Friend*\n\nA good friend. He knew everything. One day he grabbed my hand so tightly,\n\nWhy did he do that?\n\nHe apologized. Said he'd do better.\n\nI don't think he'll find another girl. The detective in me notes:\u00a0*good*.\n\n*Exhibit G: The Movie Lie*\n\nIn movies, when something terrible happens to her,in that exact tragic moment, a man appears. He saves her. Perfect timing.\n\nBut in real life? Even when you want that. Even when you're\u00a0*desperate*\u00a0for that. Where is he? How could that possibly happen?\n\nYou're alone. You sit in front of the TV. You don't even remember what you're watching.\n\nNo one comes.\n\nHow do you focus when:\n\nA man stands too close in a queue\n\nSomeone walks behind you on the street (is he following you? You don't know. You can't know.)\n\nYour own mother is so protective she won't let you do things, out of fear\n\nYou're okay with that because you're afraid too\n\n*Exhibit I: My Niece*\n\nThese interactions,all this detective work, made me okay with myself. I could live with it.\n\nUntil I saw my niece. My brother's daughter. So small. So unaware of all these things.\n\nAnd I had to ask myself: what do I tell her?\n\n\"Take care of yourself\"?\n\nWhy should SHE have to take care of herself? Why should I teach her to see every man as a potential threat?\n\nWhy are OTHER PEOPLE'S eyes on me, on her, on us and we're supposed to just accept that?\n\nDon't they have sisters? Mothers? Daughters?\n\nThe detective asks: What would save us? Education? Quality of character? Freedom?\n\nI don't know.\n\nBecause it's not in our hands. It's in theirs. The ones who decide. The ones with power.\n\nThey tell us: learn karate. Learn martial arts. Defend yourself.\n\nBut what happens when there's more than one? What do you do when they're stronger, faster, more of them?\n\nWhat do you do when the monsters have all the power and you're just supposed to,what? Be grateful you survived?\n\n*Exhibit J: The News Cycle*\n\nThen you hear the stories on TV. The news.\n\nGang rapes. In hospitals,hospitals, places meant to heal. In colleges,places meant to educate.\n\nAnd the feeling starts again. Every single time.\n\nThis time it's not just my fear. It's concern. For everyone. For all of us.\n\nI don't know what to do with it.\n\nThe thoughts cycle. The same thoughts. Over and over. Replaying in my mind like evidence I can't stop examining. The feeling,the same feeling,returns each time.\n\nThe detective notes: the case is never closed.\u00a0*New evidence arrives daily*.\n\n*Conclusion:*\n\nThe case remains open.\n\nI walk around collecting evidence: the way men look, the way they stand too close, the way they think they're entitled to space that isn't theirs.\n\nMy mother eventually let me go places. It took a long time. I wasn't ready anyway.\n\nI just wish,somewhere, somehow,that every girl walking home, commuting, existing, would not have to be a detective of her own trauma. Would not have to collect evidence of all the ways the world is unsafe. Would not have to remember in her body what her mind is trying desperately to forget.\n\nBut here we are.\n\nCase open. Always open.\n\n(Posting this makes me feel exposed, but also liberated.)\n\n\u2014\n\nEnd of report.\n\n(Posting this makes me feel exposed, but also liberated.)",

    "content": "Hello I\u2019m 18 and I just wanted to share my life story so far \nLong story short my mom never let me go anywhere I couldn\u2019t go play in the backyard or the frontyard and I couldn\u2019t go to my friends house and she never took me anywhere besides the grocery store my grandma used to call me a bitch and a slut etc etc when I was only 9 she would also beat me my grandpa used to beat me to he\u2019d beat me so badly to the point where it left welts on my skin. He\u2019d use his leather belt and a tree limb that he\u2019d call a switch. But anyways because I was never able to go anywhere I decided to start dancing inside of my house but my mom didn\u2019t like when I did that..she\u2019d get upset and yell and then say oh since you can dance you can do them dishes etc etc..because of that I decided to just stay in my room that way I won\u2019t have to get yelled at. I spent my time reading and watching anime and drawing/painting some times I\u2019d create stories or write songs something to pass the time but at one point my room started feeling like a prison. Anyways my mom would get mad that I was sleeping all day (this was when I was depressed) so she\u2019d come into my room and pull the covers off of me and then she\u2019d have me do something. I also had a cat named boo-boo I loved her a lot she was so cute but really mean anyways, there was a time she brought her kittens to me and she seemed so proud of herself like I could see the joy in her eyes and it was adorable she even did this little twirl ..I miss her.. but I was playing with her kittens and there was one that didn\u2019t like me so I tried to get him to like me and he ended up becoming my favorite we were inseparable. He\u2019d always follow me around but one day I let him go outside and next thing I know I found him d3ad in a ditch..after that I decided to close my heart so I wouldn\u2019t get hurt again. anyways I was supposed to go to school this day but I decided not to go so I hid in my room and read stories on my phone..my mom didn\u2019t come to check and see if I went to school.. I didn\u2019t pay it any mind at first since she\u2019s also in her room a lot. But I ended up having a bad gut feeling like it was really bad so I went to check up on her but she was resting her head on the stool that was in her room so I thought her heard was hurting previously so I tapped her to see if she was okay but her skin felt stiff and she was also cold so I called out to her I said mommy.. she didn\u2019t respond I tried to move her and it was like I was trying to move a boulder that\u2019s when I realized my mom had died.. I called 911 they told me what was going on etc etc..even though she just passed my grandma was talking bad about her and was looking up at the officer like she wanted to be praised for it\u2026but after that I had to take care of my grandma her health was declining and I was only 16 at the time so I got a part time job I used the money from there to support her and myself while also paying the bills and buying food and taking care of her and the house..I couldn\u2019t drive so I was stressing on how I\u2019d get the food but I found a way..my grandma would have strokes,heart attacks she\u2019d shit herself and id have to clean it up she wouldn\u2019t eat and she\u2019d smoke cigarettes all day she was in and out of rehab facilities my neighbors always blamed me because she wasn\u2019t eating..she also never wanted to take a bath so I\u2019d bathe her etc etc anyways my brother ended up coming home and he\u2019d remind me of what happened when I was little when he touched me and I\u2019d dodge the subject since I didn\u2019t want to remember it anyways fast forward my brother let\u2019s 3 stranger or his friends stay inside of the house he also started renting out a room to one of them that room being my grandmothers. They\u2019d smoke weed drink alcohol leave stains in the carpet the dog that they\u2019d had would shit everywhere it was disgusting that girl ended up becoming his girlfriend I ended up telling her what he used to do to me as a child since she told me that her brother used to touch her too but she recorded the conversation that we had and told my brother and she was laughing in reveling in the chaos that she\u2019d cause. If anyone is interested I did an aita which explains the situation. My brother went to jail and she became a squatter we boarded up the windows and everything and she still broke in the police won\u2019t do anything about it. But because of the fact that I was never around other people alot my social skills are lacking same thing with being able to process emotions and dealing with anxiety and everything else.

    "content": "I feel so conflicted.\n\nDude was *suffering*. Like his whole family before him -- both parents, a brother and a sister, he got cancer. Just like my mom.\n\nI have also been deeply furious at him for years, ever since I found out he molested my niece when she was a little girl. I'm pretty sure I wished him dead, because I couldn't find a way to deal with it all -- let's just say, there are very personal reasons for me to believe her. My niece, who is now an adult, explicitly asked those of us in the know to not pursue any action on her behalf, or to tell his wife and kids -- and we've respected her wishes. \n\nApparently, I'm capable of forgiveness for what was done to me, but not for what was done to the little girl I used to care for as a baby. The only thing I could do that respected both our feelings on the matter was to go as low contact as possible with him, without cutting the rest of his family out. I don't think I've spoken more than two words to him ever since learning what he did.\n\nWhen he was diagnosed with cancer, my concern was for my aunt and three cousins. I knew what they were in for. There was no love lost for him, but they matter. Yet, when my cousin called to tell me the news, all I could say was \"Oh\", and confirm the burial details.\n\nYes, I'm going.\n\nI owe that much to my aunt and cousins. After my mom died, my gran and auntie took me in, but my other aunt, with her husband and kids, lived right around the block, and were always at my gran's house, anyway -- they only went home to sleep, minus one cousin who also lived with us. In a way, they're my other siblings. Both aunts helped raised me.\n\nAnd the uncle -- it kind of hit me, while messaging work about the funeral, in a \"letting you know, not asking permission\" sort of way -- I owe it to him, too. He never tried to be my dad, unlike the aunt who tried to be my mother, but he was there, too. He's the one who carted me to or from school for a decade, even when I wasn't in the same school as his own kids anymore, even when they didn't make it into higher ed. He's the one who helped me move out when a major earthquake left me homeless, and then again after the break up with my ex.\n\nI'm not sorry he's dead, but I'm upset anyway. A part of me feels like it's wrong to even feel sad. Another feels it makes sense.\n\nCan someone please tell me I'm not wrong for feeling... anything, everything?",

    "content": "Hi, I am 16F. I'll be turning 17 this month. I don't know why but I feel like 9yr old me's suicide attempt should've worked. Well I've never attempted but I often think about it. It started around 8-9. I often had very deep suicidal thoughts i still do now. But lately these days I feel like maybe I should just actually do it. But I'll just be a scared coward like always anyways and won't do it.\n\nPeople who ive vented to often told me that i was strong to survive all this. I don't feel that way. I just feel that I've zone out through everything. A person I once extremely looked at told me I was strong to survive all this and was way too mature for a child when I was just 14.  \n\nMy family has always been abusive. Especially my father. I don't like to call him that. In my eyes he doesnt deserve to be called one. The same goes to my so called mother. Both of them should've been divorced but they stayed together because they had children. \n\nSo when I was just 4. I remember vividly that there was a huge fight between them. My mother was unconscious. Remember just 4. I do not know how i remember all that when I was just a 4. All i remember was surviving in that household. I was extra careful to not get caught doing ANYTHING. \n\nThat still didn't stop. His abusive behaviour only worsened my brother was born. Kicking us out of the house. I cried to stay with my father because I was just stupid, dumb 5 years old.  Somehow i didn't remember that he actually left me to someone else on the streets according to what my mother says. Whatever i do not know why he took me back in. \n\nGetting yelled by him, calling me slurs even till this day. I am so exhausted. He even beats me.\n\nAnother is when I was SA'd multiple times as a kid who was just 7-9. I can't remember much. There was this guy who was definitely 14. He kept touching me in weird ways. He almost tried to do it. But I have a strong feeling he didn't do it because he would be caught. For multiple times I was SA'd by this guy. I finally had the courage to tell my mom. Her answer?\n\"It happened so long ago it doesn't matter\" I can't tell if it because I didn't straight up tell it was SA or she's just too naive.\n\nAnd there was this another time where I kept a journal writting all my bad memories because I didn't like making friends and people didn't want to be friends with me. She read everything, beat me later. I never wrote a thing in my journal since then. \n\nAnd there's this so called friend who made fun of me getting SA'D twice and said \"what if it rape :)\" yeah I haven't forgiven her. And she blocked me later pretty recently because I didn't forgive her bs lol. \n\nMy so called family still abuse me till this day. \n\nI really wish I was still the little girl I was when I was little. Back then i really was strong. No matter what I always stooed positive and never let anyone make me sad but now. I am not sure. ",

    "content": "It's a long story, but I request anyone who clicked to read it. please i need guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so this all starts from when I was 15 last year, on May 1, 2023. Me and my sister had a minor argument, of which I did not think that much. I was pretty much laughing during it, even though my father was there to witness it, and even he kept on giggling, and we thought that it wasn't serious. But my sister was overreacting as usual, so she locked her door, and I called it a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext morning, I forgot about the argument, and I asked for her phone because I needed to call someone and my phone wasn't recharged. She was sleeping when I asked for her phone, so she gave it to me without second guessing. Me being me, I did use the phone to call the person, but I opened her WhatsApp, which she used to keep locked all the time, but this time she didn't, and I saw a guy, and I got curious because my sister did not mention him to any of us, and he looked kind of fishy, so I opened their messages and kept on reading, and guess what I found out? My sister secretly hates me and wishes death upon me. trash talks me and my parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this made me extremely sad because, not gonna lie, but because of the age gap, I guess I used to think of my sister as a second mother. And the irony is that the day before, I was scrolling through Instagram, and a reel made me realize that the only women who will love me unconditionally are my sister and mother. I literally said these words because I have a habit of talking to myself. Reading all those chats, I mean the guy was threatening to hit me and break my legs (they targeted my legs, especially because I had a deformity that I did get fixed two months ago).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver since that day, I used to overthink it all the time I tried talking to my sister, and she kept on screaming and kicked me out of her room. All these months until August, I did not speak to her, expecting her to approach and talk to me, but on her birthday, I finally spoke to her. Even then, she was throwing her tantrums at me when I took a bit of extra time to pick her up .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I started talking to her, and even though we lived under the same roof, she barely came out of her room. Then comes September, and I finally think about talking to her seriously because all these months that shit still hurt like hell. One day she's studying, and I go to her room after months (even before the incident, I barely went to her room because she never liked talking to me ever since COVID). Her room has a bookshelf that has my old books on it, so I was searching for them, pretending that I was here for a reason, and the reason is books. You know the next thing that happens is that she starts crying as if I'm wasting her time in her room (she's been practicing for UPSC for a few years at home). Then I sat there and opened up about how I feel and everything, and you know what she said to me in return? She said that the reason she said all those things about me is because I used to hit her as a kid, specifically when I was 10. She was describing it as if a drunk guy beats his wife. when actually they were only normal sibling fights, other than one incident where I hit her leg with my bat when I was 10 or 9, and I dont even remember the reason, but in return, my dad gave me a good beat later. I apologized, and she kept on crying and shouting and described our fights even from when I was 8, like I used to torture her or something, but I apologized because yeah, I was wrong to hit her, but in my defense, all those times she was double my size or height; she is a big girl, and she used to hit me back as well. I still apologized, and it's over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow she needs time to think after dumping all those things on me, but I respected that and went out. Now she is talking to me when needed in a normal tone. Ever since my surgery, she has started being a little nicer to me, but it did feel like an act, even though I wish it was not. Along with all these things, there were also a lot of other things that were going on in my life, including a serious fight with my best friend, where I even ghosted him for 5 months, and the stress of surgery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was basically scared, and on top of that, my parents were okay with my condition and didn't want to spend money on it, so I basically had to cry for days for it as well. All these months, I started focusing on myself and stopped playing videogames. I was working out before that, so I kept on doing it, and I started eating less because I was too lazy to learn how to cook, so I stopped eating breakfast and only used to eat at night. I have been very bad at studying, so I started studying as well. Overall, I was trying to better myself all these months, and I even made up the courage to finally go through the surgery because I was not going out because of my condition. I skipped many functions, always standing with my knees bent so they didn't look deformed. Funny that my dad told me to kill myself when I was convincing him for my surgery when it was literally a medical deformity that caused me knee pain, and I was on medication for 2 years, 13\u201314, which can lead to arthritis in the future. My dad told me to kill myself because I am useless, and giving birth to me only made his and my mother's life worse. That was also during a time when I was expecting his support the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had bad grades, no friends because I cut off any connection with my friend group because my best friend was still a part of it, was scared because of surgery, and on top of that, I lived with the thought that my sister hated me. But I kept on going, and finally, after weeks and many consultations with multiple doctors, my dad got convinced, even though 5 minutes before my surgery, literally 5 minutes before, he was still calling it a mistake and was basically scolding me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, my legs turned out to be right, but TODAY something happened. You know how 10th boards are next month, and today I saw the blue print, and it turns out all the chapters I did are only coming for 1 mark, so basically the questions will only come for 9 marks for the 5 chapters I did, and that made me extremely worried. And i still am lazy and procrastinate a lot but today i finally studied a lot without any breaks and when i took a 30min break which is impossible for me because my 30min breaks always turn out to be 2 hours today for the first time i stood to what i said and went back to studying and right after i started studying something happened between my mother and i and it led to an arguement i was talking loudly my sister came running and called police on me just because i was shouting later my mom took her phone and talked to them and told them its fine but i got very upset that she always thinks the worst of me and speculated that i was hitting my mom when i wasnt. Last month, I cut myself and started bleeding. My blood was all over the floor, and when my sister saw it, she said that it was my mother's blood, and I cut her when it had nothing to do with her. Now, to be honest with anyone who's reading, I'm the type of guy who loves his parents the most. My friends called me Mamma's Boy because, you know, friends say madarchod and things like that to each other. I always get upset and mad when somebody talks to me that way even my friends know that , and on top of that, my sister's chat made me realize that I will have to be there for my parents because she not only hated me but also my parents, not as much as she hated me, but still, dad and mom were mentioned. Today, when she called the police, I got really, really angry about why she always thinks the worst of me and why she compares me to a drunk man who beats his wife. And I also said that even though I do get angry and talk to my parents loudly, I would never say all those things you said about them behind their backs. My sister being a drama queen, she was crying already and started shouting the same thing that I hit her with a bat once, only that once incident from when I was 10. She called dad to come home early, saying that I hit mom, and she also told him that she called the police, which she did like I said. Dad came, and they made us sit down and talk about it. I again asked her about the chat, and again she started shouting things at me like how I tortured her and shit. I asked her when I tortured u she couldn't say anything other than I hit her with a bat once, which was also only one nice hit when I was 10 and she was 17. I mean, I am 16 now, and when I stand next to a 13-year-old, I feel like I am standing next to a toddler. How bad can a 10-year-old hit someone twice his size to make them feel like they got tortured their entire life? I got extremely pissed; she wasn't letting me say anything and kept on shouting, and I finally did it. I punched her real hard in the face, which is something I am not proud of. I mean hitting women stinks, but I still feel like she deserved it. She goes to her room, locks her door, and 10 minutes later, two policemen came to our house. They did not listen to a word I said, and she kept on exaggerating everything. She also had to share my personal problems with them. They did not listen to a word I said when I told them that the reason we were arguing in the first place was the chats. You know what they said? \"Purani baat hai bhul ja.\" they choose to ignore the fact that her boyfriend was literally asking for my location , so that he could beat me up when am outside . I even said it multiple times, even before they came, and it hurt me more than anything that the person I trust the most would say these things about me. No reaction at all, and you know what the guy said? \"She is older than you; she can say all those things,\" and she kept on talking about my childhood and how I hit her, which she exaggerated a lot, but when I said anything, they kept on shutting me down. My parents were there all that time, and 20 minutes later, when she stopped, my dad and my mom kept complaining; they even included my legs and made fun of it, saying that I was delusional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was and still am a guy who has put his parents his entire life above anything. I never tell them I love them. I dont talk very sweetly to them, but I swear to God I'd let someone actually torture me but not hurt my parents. Today, I feel like the only people I cared about betrayed me, called the police on me for a punch, and embarrassed me in front of the whole neighborhood. Everyone knows now. I am typing this when I am locked in my room, and I don't know what to do anymore. They told me if my sister calls them again, they won't listen to a word I say. On top of that, he forcedfully made me apolgogise to her and touch her feet , and that guy even speculated that I was somehow a bully in school when I am actually a quiet kid. I don't know what to do right now. I can't live under the same roof as my sister. I hate her. I literally can't believe I used to lose sleep thinking that my sister didn't like me. Yesterday only i was defending her in her instagram comment section against a random guy :) Let me know what I should do, please. and feel free to DM. I would appreciate a one-on-one talk right now.",

If you want to see the original, please go to my profile.\n\nI suffered through narcissistic abuse by my partner for 23 years. This incident happened when we were still friends. If I had I only known the truth when this had originally happened, I would have been saved from decades of emotional, psychological, verbal, physical, sexual, and physical abuse. (And currently post-separation abuse).\n\nThe cast: me, my ex Bub (Beelzebub), my ex-crush B, Bub's gf M, Bub's bf V (It will make sense when you read it.)\n\nTW: Suicide, self-harm, abuse\n\nWe met through a mutual friend. We became really close really quickly. He was 17 and I was 19. We would talk for hours about anything and everything. I was raised around domestic abuse, and my family was highly dysfunctional. I suffered severe trauma as a child being raised in this environment with an abusive father and brother. (His namesake). By the time I met Bub, I had been having mental health struggles for many years. To deal with the trauma I still suffered from I would self-harm by cutting frequently. I also had been in a psychiatric hospital twice for suicide attempts. I told Bub about all of this, and he knew that I still did it. He was very supportive and would get really sad when I harmed myself.\n\nSince we were just friends we would talk about our crushes. He had a crush on a girl from high school and I had a crush on one of my ex's B, who was also my high school crush. We only dated for 3 weeks, and we decided we were better as friends then lovers. Though we did have a FWB thing going on when we were both single. He really talked up his crush and I really talked up mine.\n\nTwo months into our friendship he got a gf. He told me she was a girl he knew from his home city named M. He claimed her mother would babysit him and his brother. He really talked this girl up. She was into all the same things as him. I was starting to believe he talked her up to make me jealous, which it honestly did. However, I knew it was petty jealousy and I was very happy for him and expressed that to him.\n\nI don't know whose idea it was for her to start communicating with me, but she started emailing me to get to know his best friend (me). I was totally cool with this and was excited to get to know her. Before I know it, she starts getting really nasty with me for no apparent reason. It really upset me. My natural impulse at the time when I was upset was to cut. It was a maladaptive coping mechanism I had for years, and I did it when I was really upset. I explained this to him, and he said he would talk to her. He showed real concern I was harming myself and he also wanted her to stop.\n\nSo, he told me he had talked to her, and she had told him she would stop harassing me for no good reason. She didn't stop. She continued to say the vilest and f'd up things to me, including making crass and insensitive comments about my suicidal ideation and self-harm. Naturally I was really upset and cut myself pretty badly. I still have the scar.\n\nThis basically went on until they broke up a month later. He said she was doing heroin, and he was vehemently against drugs. He said that they had a good friend that died of an OD, and he couldn't be with her if she was going to do that. It was over. She never contacted me again.\n\nA couple of months later me and Bub started dating. He ended up telling me that him and M didn't really date, and he had only told me that to make me jealous. AHA! I was correct!\n\nSo, I asked to meet her. He was a bit hesitant at first, but he finally agreed. At this point his bf V from his home city was dating her. It was the perfect opportunity to meet her as like a double date. I will say, at that time in my life I could be possessive and jealous. Not proud of it, but I was young and immature. I ended up treating her pretty snidely because of this.\n\nOne night we were out with them, and Bub got into a car accident. We ended up having to call his dad for a ride home. When we got to his home, his dad was contemplating letting them sleep there. I whispered in Bub's ear that I was not okay with his ex-gf sleeping at his house. She overheard me tell him this. She pulled me aside and told me they never dated. WHAT? I was furious. Bub made eye contact with me, and by the look on his face, I could tell he knew what she told me. The ride back, to drop them at home in his dad's car, was uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nAfter he dropped them off, I confronted him. His explanation was I was so pushy to meet her, but he knew how jealous I could be, so he didn't want to actually introduce me to the real M. Ends up V was dating a girl with the same name. I felt so stupid and betrayed. I wanted to end it, but he seemed so remorseful I ended up giving him another chance.\n\nWell, the years go rolling by, and I hear no more about this girl who he was so close with, in the past. Bub was a very charismatic person with a lot of friends. He never stopped speaking to friends permanently and they would come in and out of his life. I found it a little odd that there was no mention of her but didn't think much else of it. I also never really formally met her.\n\nThen Facebook became a thing. He ended up being friends with every person he had ever known. Except her. I would bring it up and he would always have some excuse. We ended up moving in with his brother in 2015. I wasn't really around his brother a lot, so I never got a chance to talk to him at length. I remember at one point I brought her up. I was just so curious at the mystery girl and wanted to see if he was still in touch with her. He told me he didn't know what I was talking about. He said his mother never left them with babysitters and only worked when they were in school.\n\n\"What does that mean,\" I'm thinking. WTF does that mean? I brought it up to Bub and he told me she only babysat a few times so his brother probably forgot. But this didn't sit right with me. He had told me that she would babysit them frequently. He denied ever saying the frequency. What could I do but believe him? It had been almost 15 years by that point. That's a long time to keep a secret like that and it's possible I simply didn't remember right. Surely, he was telling me the truth. I dropped it for good.\n\nWe get married that year. We had a child the next year. We had a stillborn a year after that. All this time until 2022, I started feeling really uneasy about our relationship. I started suspecting that his behavior towards me was abusive.\n\nBy the end of 2022 I was broken. A lot of things happened between here and the summer of 2023 when the conclusion to this situation came to an end. I will say I really started to acknowledge he was abusive, but I was still so desperate to salvage my marriage with my eternal hope that he could change. I was just so broken by then I didn't think I deserved any better, and no one else could possibly want a worthless, pitiful broken mess like me.\n\nThe summer of 2023, while laying sleepless in bed, the memory of M flashed through my mind. I started remembering details I had long forgotten. Why did I never meet her? Why was she never his friend on Facebook? Why had neither of them reached out to each other? I had met every person he talked about, or he was at least friends with them on Facebook. Why not her? Why did his brother not remember? Why did he say M's mother babysat them all the time? I KNOW he originally said that damn it! Why was her email address, at only 17-years-old, her first and last name? 17-year-olds don't use their names like professionals. They call themselves sparklybutterflies86 for christ's sakes! This was all going through my head.\n\nThe next day I confronted Bub. I will paraphrase to the best of my memory:\n\nMe: Was M real?\n\nBub: I thought this had been settled already.\n\nMe: No. No, it hasn't. You told me your brother just did not remember her and that was the last I spoke of it.\n\nBub: Deadpanned looking me right in the eye \"No. She wasn't real. I thought you knew this by now.\"\n\nI can't really remember what I said at that point, but it was a lot of \"how the fuck could you do that? and other expletives. His excuse was he was an insecure teenager, and he was jealous of B and how much I talked about him. A fucking insecure teenager. Talking up his high school crush didn't make me jealous, so he made up a gf.\n\nHe pretended to be a gf, who went on to harass the shit out me. Which caused me to be so distraught that I cut myself. He knew I was harming myself and he kept on doing it. I still bare the fucking scar from that time. He involved a poor innocent girl that I was fucking terrible to. Not to mention the fake story of a friend that Od'd. And his excuse for this deranged, diabolical, INSANE fucking shit was, \"I was an insecure teenager.\" No fucking big deal, right?\n\nI can honestly say, since I was raised in dysfunction, I have a very skewed idea of what is normal 17-year-old behavior. Maybe he never said anything because of shame, despite the fact it was still on my mind, and he could have stopped it at any time. Is this really as diabolical and INSANE as I think it is? Am I wrong to think only a truly evil person would do this? Or is this as insignificant as he and his friends are claiming?",

    "content": "So I want to preface this post by saying that this is purely just me wanting advice on what I should do, any help or comfort would also be very helpful.  Also a quick TW for suicidal thoughts and S/A so if that\u2019s triggering for anyone, please don\u2019t continue reading.  Along with that, I\u2019m aware by me posting to a public forum is for all to see and no one will probably see this but if anyone does, please don\u2019t post on any other platform or anything of that sort, I want to try and make this as vague as possible without giving away too much about myself as it might be potentially unsafe for me if anyone in my family were to find this post.  Apologies if this is super long, wordy, and incomprehensible, I\u2019m just a bundle of many emotions and thoughts right now.\n\nI want to start by saying I\u2019m not a great person and I know that.  I can be self-centered and talk about myself a lot, which can definitely be annoying and honestly there are many qualities about myself I\u2019d like to change.  I want to start with saying that so no one thinks I\u2019m purposely trying to make myself seem like a perfect person when I\u2019m far, far away with that.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to get hit by my parents and also my grandparents (pretty typical for a first-generation American with immigrant POC parents) and that was the first type of trauma and abuse I\u2019ve faced when I was younger.  Then, at around maybe kindergarten age, I was S/A\u2019d by one of my parents employees (they own businesses) and it went on for months before he quit, ranging from inappropriate touching to full on penetration (which was more rare but still happened a few times).  When I was in fourth grade, I finally understood what had happened was wrong and told my parents, which proved to be the wrong decision.  My mom told me to keep it a secret as it was shameful and make the whole situation about her and how she immigrated to make a better life for her family but instead this happens while my dad was indifferent in the beginning (but he did call up the old employee to ban him from ever coming back).  My mom also told two other employees about this situation so they could give the old one a call since they spoke Spanish mostly.  In fifth grade, my mom was especially insufferable and there was this one situation that sticks with me until now.  So my mom owned a restaurant and I was eating that day when a shrimp peel got stuck in my throat (embarrassing I know).  While I was gagging trying to get rid of it, my mom just ignored me while one of the waitresses that worked there was trying to help me and save me by giving me water and trying to perform Heimlich (not sure how to spell it) on me.  After the whole ordeal was over, my mom just told me, \u201cNext time you\u2019re choking, do it in the back.  You\u2019re scaring away the customers.\u201d  That has stuck with me because it just really was the time that showed me how little I mattered to her.  Her business and getting money was more important to her than my life.  Another instance was when her cousin was complaining of a headache, my mom was immediately worried for her and when I complained about it to her, she just told me, \u201cWell she wouldn\u2019t lie to me and knows what pain is.\u201d  As if I ever lied about any issues to her?  That was when I first ever had the urge to just end my life.  Looking back it\u2019s so sad that little fifth grade me was already thinking such horrible thoughts.  It\u2019s crazy because I even had a suicide note written and everything, hidden in my backpack.  I never really did anything to hurt myself because I was scared of the pain, which really shows how innocent I was.  I was also scared of the repercussions if I were to fail my attempt, as lord knows what my parents would have done.  This next part I\u2019m not proud of but I used to really hate my younger brothers and hit them.  I\u2019m not saying this to defend myself or excuse any of my past actions because I knew it was wrong then and I still know it is wrong now but my parents really favored my brothers over me and was unfair with their treatment, so I really resented them.  Due to this, anytime they didn\u2019t listen to me or do something I didn\u2019t like, I disciplined them by hitting them, something I knew worked because that\u2019s what my parents did to me my whole life.  I realized it was really wrong way too late and only stopped once I got to eighth grade.  That was also the year I started to watch my brothers at home, as all of my other family lived out of state and my mom moved out with them, while my dad worked all day.  At that point, not only was I watching my brothers at home and cooking for them, I was also helping with bills and any issues that required calling customer service (not using my money to pay but rather calling in and getting them paid as again, my mom was out of state and my dad was working all day and also doesn\u2019t know much English).  Once I got to high school, we all ended up moving to the state my mom was in and was reunited but until this day, I\u2019m still watching my brothers on most days as both of my parents work.  I still cook for them on most days and drive them to extracurriculars, sometimes even taking them for orientations or parent-teacher conferences.  I also sometimes go to ones for my uncles family as their English isn\u2019t good either and help translate for them.  I also helped install the wifi, cameras, and helped build shoe cabinets, desks, and chairs around the house (though I didn\u2019t mind that as much since I\u2019m going into the engineering field so I\u2019m using it as practice).  Currently I\u2019m still in high school but I\u2019m pretty busy with my sport, clubs, and academics, since I\u2019m taking all advanced/AP classes.  The reason why I\u2019m making this post today is because I recently got into this argument (can\u2019t really call it that since I didn\u2019t even talk back) with my parents.  This really hurt me and honestly I haven\u2019t gone a day without crying about it since it happened four days ago.  I asked for a private coach for my sport but rather than just saying no, my mom went on a whole tangent about how I\u2019m bad at everything I do, my rank and GPA is too low, my SAT (mind you it\u2019s a practice test, not a real one) score was too low, I\u2019m not good at the sport I do, and overall about how untalented I was.  She said that I want everyone to think I\u2019m good at everything when in reality I\u2019m bad at all of it.  That is completely untrue as if I really thought I was good at everything, why would I ask for a private coach for my sport and take SAT tutoring classes?  I know there is room for improvement in everything I do, I\u2019ve lost countless hours of sleep crying over the fact that I know I\u2019m untalented in everything I do.  Jack of all trades but master of none as they say.  I have countless journal entries just talking about how worthless I feel.  Rather than feeling any sympathy for me while I was crying, when I went upstairs to my room (crying quite loudly I must add) I could hear them downstairs making fun of me and talking down on me even more.  I have truly never seen such hatred from a mother to her own daughter.  I guess what they say is true, no one is as big of a girls hater as her own mother.  Aside from this instance, ever since middle school honestly, I have never once had a conversation with her without her having to insult me or yell at me.  From my weight (I\u2019m not even overweight either, not that there is anything wrong if I was, but it boggles me why it\u2019s such an issue when I fall under the normal weight for girls my age and height) to my academics to honestly anything, she always seems to have to find something about me to complain about.  Then they always wonder why I never come out of my room to socialize with them.  Yeah, I really can\u2019t seem the figure out why\u2026. I literally feel a closer connection to the doctor I talked to about my menstrual issues with than her.  Oh yeah and I also forgot to mention that I have really bad and irregular periods and I got my period like five years ago so it\u2019s not normal for it to still be irregular.  I brought this up with my mom and at first she talked about it with doctors but after countless visits with no answers, she kind of gave up and doesn\u2019t really care anymore.  The last doctor we went to said maybe it\u2019s because my diet isn\u2019t good (I mentioned to her that I have body image issues to sometimes I do skip meals) and my mom ended up not bringing me to another doctor after that because she thought the doctor didn\u2019t know what she was talking about because I\u2019m clearly fat, which again, I\u2019m really not overweight at all.  My dad also called me today to defend my mom for what she said four days ago and I\u2019m just so sick of it all.  There is so much more fucked up things they\u2019ve done to me but this post probably would never end if I listed it all out so I think I\u2019m just going to leave this here because this is way too long already.  Sorry if this is a mess of a post and if it\u2019s everywhere but I really don\u2019t know what to do at this point and how to continue with my life because I feel those really bad thoughts from little fifth grade me creeping back and I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d rather die or live anymore so someone just give me advice or a word of comfort or anything that you think might help please.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I don't know how many people will see this or respond to this but I just wanted to put this here to get an unbiased opinion of my situation. I Don\u2019t use reddit much because of the stigma around it or I just don't have time but I have gotten a lot of the information I know today regarding various substances amongst other things and has been a very educational outlet for me but I just wanted to vent about many things in my life currently and I\u2019m not sure exactly which subreddit this is most appropriate for so I\u2019ll just post it in several. But I am 16 years old, I grew up in fairley calm suburbs of southern New Hampshire and for the most part have had a very stable childhood growing up with two very loving parents who I've been close with my whole life (up until recently). I\u2019m not sure where things started to go wrong so I\u2019ll just start from the beginning. I was always an eccentric child, very independent yet relied on the acceptance of others to stay happy. The \u201cclass clown\u201d all through elementary and middle school, would get in trouble alot but it was always for minor stupid things that didnt matter. I was always friends with everyone I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201cpopular\u201d per say but everyone knew who I was and I was easy to get along with as I would never hold grudges against people no matter what, witch became a flaw for me later on as it would allow people and friends to take advantage of me in one way or another to no bother to me. My ability to do schoolwork was average, at around grade 3 I had remained a generally c student due to many factors (an EXTREME case of procrastination was one of them). And it was around this time that my fantasation for a reckless or \u201ccool/badass\u201d lifestyle had begun. \n\nThis was just because I was not insecure about myself or who I was that I was generally the first one to try something or do something, and in elementary school before I even knew what drugs were just because I would be laughing or cracking jokes kids would come up to me and ask \u201care you high?!\u201d Eventually it just simply became easier to say yes to these sorts of questions because honestly I liked the attention it brought me and my personality began to reflect that. From here on out many people in school would always talk to me like I was a pet or something like my opinion was not worthless per say but taken very lightly and as a joke, I became I character of who I was and people talked down to me that way, and for a long time I was okay with playing this role. Until eventually you know I was kinda just like \u201cwell I guess I gotta smoke weed ig\u201d And that's exactly what I did, around january of last year I had first started to smoke and around that time among some of the first few times I did I got caught hitting a dab pen on the buss and was suspended from school for a week. After this I quickly moved on to other things as I became bored of weed, I would start heavily abusing drugs like hydrocodone, adderall, and cocaine. This was right when quarantined was first starting and I was fired from from my first job at a pizza place because of corona as I was deemed \u201cnot the most essential worker\u201d My grades were dropping severely and I didn\u2019t care, we were quarantined, we had no specific schedule schedule to follow or zooms to join so all motivation I may of had to do work (witch was very little anyways) was now zero. Besides I was fucked up basically 24/7. And I hadn\u2019t noticed it at the time but while I was on coke I had a very destructive personality, would intentionally go as long as I could without sleep (this would last for weeks), couldn't keep my temper, would lash out violently, nothing severe but enough to begin to trouble the relationship I had with my parents. I don't have very addictive genes at all which I pride myself on though, so after I was basically face full of blow for a month or so and when I ran out I just stopped, which was dope lol. But it wasn\u2019t until late june of this last summer when I had discovered the world of psychedelics. And tbh it was great for me, I didn\u2019t try to go to these drugs as a means of escape from my problems or reality, or to produce for me artificial happiness, I wanted to \u201cexpand my mind\u201d or some naive bullshit like that witch at the time I couldn\u2019t possibly of known what that meant, but what it did was put my problems in the perspective of where I was in the universe, showed me the synchronized energy that exists in all life, and really did make me believe in some sort of higher power. Amongst other things I truly equate my voyage into hallucinogens to have not cured my depression but helped me create a new perspective of my life which led to me being a much happier person in general. And showed me that I don't need those other drugs as I was gaining nothing productive from them whatsoever.\n\n  Because before this I was extremely depressed for many reasons, the personality I grew to adapt where all I wanted was to make my friends family and everyone around me happy ignited some sort of identity crisis within me because I would put on so many different layers or masks of who I was to the different people who I would surround myself around that I truly began to not know who I was or what I felt, because I could be crying, alone, by myself, and I would not be able to decipher in my mind if what I was feeling was truly sadness or just some way for me to get what I want somehow or elicit a reaction for personal gain. Even if this was not true it made all my emotions become numb in a way. And I felt that I was undeserving of happiness for things that I have done. These things I have never shared with anyone except my therapist but I feel are necessary to my story which I am about to tell you here. Growing up I had very traditional viewed parents, my father was an Italian who grew up in a military household in the fifties, and my mother was born and raised in Russia during the fall of the soviet union until she moved here in the early 2000\u2019s. Their 30 year age difference may seem quite strange to many but they loved each other greatly regardless and was not something I particularly paid any mind to. Personally I see them as a power couple in a way but to this before they had children their sex life was very active and kinky for better use of the word. At a very young age I had stumbled across a box of various many toys my mom kept under her bed, and as a developing hormonal child, these were things I began to experiment with, coupled with a very close friend of mine who I had probably knew since I was born but was two or three years older than me when I was maybe 12 or so he began to masturbate while we were hanging out and I was told that it was a normal thing for guy friends to do, and that is what I believed. Eventually these hangouts became more and more directly sexually orientated leaving me somewhat desiring this sort of sexual affection as I had not yet had had a girlfriend so this was all I knew to be. Leaving me feeling very sexually confused as I knew I still was attracted to girls and wanted them, and I knew that I definitely resented the thought of maybe being gay. So while I was about 13 years old, when I was like peak hornyness, lying in bed searching for new ways to pleasure myself I had begun inappropriately touching my little brother at night while he slept who I share a room with and still do.. I knew what I was doing was wrong and I hated myself for it, It\u2019s not like I was attracted to him or anything, what I was doing was more an act of lost desperation. This went on for several months, Until I finally put stop to this senseless act. This is something that still eats at me to this day and I cannot forgive myself for. My therapist told me that exploration like this is normal especially given my circumstances, but nevertheless contributed to my feelings of intense self loathing. During the spring of last year when I was going through this mental distress I had desperately tried to eradicate any homosexual feelings that dwelled in my brain, leaving me very vulnerable to one instance where someone who I had once considered my best friend and had come with me and my family camping in the past had tried to leginamatly kill me because his girlfriend had admittingly coerced me while I was notibly intoxicated to say I would do something with her over social media, and before you say that no matter what thats still a scumbag thing to do especially to your friend, this may sound weird or like some bullshit excuse but literally a week before that event this couple had both come to me genuinely asking me several times to have sexual interactions with my friends girlfreind because my friend \u201cwas a virgin and was scared\u201d Literally it\u2019s as weird as it sounds I have no fucking clue what they wanted but its an offer I declined in a time in my life were they both knew that I was going through some shit, not that Im using that as an excuse just noting. And then in late spring something happened that would change my life forever...\n\n as I was still on this mindless mission to find inner peace with my homosexual demons leading me to have one night stands with random girls, this one person who was almost 18 while I was still 15 invited me to have sex with her, I had brought I condom but she told me not to use it because she was infertile and claimed to not be able to get pregnat, I had said again I would be more comfortable If did wear protection cuz yk, but at the time being so naive I didn\u2019t understand why someone would lie about something like this, long story short she had a child, a child that is mine, and she had this baby and impregnated herself on purpose for reasons I wont ever really fully understand. I hold resentment for this person for what she did to me, but I couldn't fully victimize myself cuz it\u2019s not like she raped me or something, that child is as much mine as it is hers. But nevertheless I decided not to be a part of it\u2019s life after long and daunting consideration. And to be honest I don't know if the decision I chose was right, one things for sure I definitely do not want to be a part of her life but it is not the baby's fault that anything of this has happened yk..\n\n But anyways life moved on, summer came, and I was feeling generally better, partially because of the acid I was taking as I had described earlier. And as much as the lsd was beneficial to me it was my demon. Yes I began to abuse the drug but it seemed to do more good for me than bad, my body didn\u2019t crave the drug but my mind craved what knowledge lsd could provide it, because for a brief 7 hours you are shown a glimpse into a reality where everything exists and flows in synchrony and harmony, and after a week of being here you begin to feel uncomfortable with how little sense everything makes cuz a week or so after tripping ur still kinda in an acid mindset and ig I had evolved to want to live like that forever, and that's what I did for several months. Lsd is a relatively smart drug and if you start to abuse it it will tell you so by giving you bad trips or what have you, but I had a relatively stable mind and it had built my ego up in a way where I believed that every single one of my trips was beneficial to me because I wasn\u2019t experiencing any negative side effects at the time. And eventually I just started taking it for the magical body high and the fun visuals, and I said I didn't like tripping alone cuz I would get into my head to much so I would only rlly trip at parties and mix with other substances like nitrous and mdma, but maybe that's exactly what I needed, to get into my own head. And throughout the entire summer every time most of my friends wanted to hang out with me they would have to lie to their parents about where they were going because of who I was, which really upset me, this prevented us from getting as close as we could have been, because it\u2019s not like they would be doing anything different if I was there or wasn't, It just made me feel like an outcast and lower than my peers, and all of their parents would gossip about me and everything in their group chats and spread false rumors like immature children like wtf bruh r yall fr. \n\nBut in early October my friend who I had mentioned earlier who tried to kill me had invited my to his girlfriends house (who happened to be my neighbor), just to hang out or something which was normal ish, because I simply assumed that what happened like 7 months prior was in the past, and whether or not I actually did anything wrong you could validly argue that I was a worse person back then and because of this over the summer I had actively tried to change myself for the better, and whether or not this was because I so actively hated the idea of who I was that I would look for any excuse to say I changed,but I was genuinely on a path of self improvement. And I had assumed my friend had to as we hung out once prior to this. But regardless, what ended up happening is he tried to jump my be kicking me in the mouth while I was sitting down unaware and repeatedly stomping my head neck and back into the ground, when he had finished adrenalin was still pumping through my veins so I didn\u2019t yet feel the pain and I knew that if I was to fight back this would be the exact reaction he would be looking for so I mockingly laughed it off and walked home. Tbh at this point I just felt bad for him, it made me upset that someone who used to be my friend would have such strong feeling of hatred that would only dwell inside him for so long. But I just thought that if I paid them no mind (which I had already been doing) then they would just be crazy on their own, but the next day he went on to go to the school and the police with several accusations that I had done nonconsensual things with a handful of people. And posting it on social media and such, would later be revealed that after police did their thorough investigations that all whimsical accusations as they were, were all complete bullshit. Which was great news for me but the whole fiasco left me very mentally drained and I had lost several friends in the process, and this person who did this ended up receiving no punishment. \n\nThese events combined with the child left me with this fear of any sort of relationship (which probably was good thing for a little bit) but it became something I couldn\u2019t get rid of, I almost had this ptsd of romance or intimacy had it had caused me so much distraught in the past leaving me with an inability to feel any type of way with a girl even if I really like her. But with time I feel this will pass. Anyways after this some more minor things happened like getting robbed of 320$ during an acid deal. But overall things were starting to get better for me, and I started small scale dealing nicotine amongst other things, nothing major yk just to some close people I knew. But recently when I got caught It was kinda just the last straw for me, and I had planned to take my life, not because I got caught that would be beyond pathetic, but because all the willpower I had to keep being positive because I knew that whatever I was experiencing was a \u201cbad time\u201d not a \u201cbad life\u201d and if I just kept pushing through and staying positive then things would turn up, but they hadn't, and the more I tried to better myself to create a better image for myself the more bad things were happening, and I was questioning whether If by trying to stay happy I was lying to myself that I was happy when I wasn\u2019t. But ik thats bs cuz I can be happy if I want the only person who could tell me if I was happy was me and if I wanted to be happy I could be yk or sum shit like that. But yeah with this all of those old feelings of depression came back, and for the longest time I had been able to balance my life with my family and my life with friends manageably well, but as my parents eventually found out everything abt me I began to feel trapped and cornered mentally and basically I had a complete ego death on only half a tab and tried to kill myself and was sent to the hospital the next from neck related injuries, and this experience traumatized me enough to never want to do drugs again, but I believe that bad trips are the best kind usually because you learn things about yourself that you may not be ready to learn and in the moment it really suck but afterwards they are usually the most beneficial, and this was I am now really starting to try to do good in school, meditating every day, Ive been going to the gym every day, reading, I cut out masturbation and pornagraphy, while I\u2019m still currently on suspension. Quitting nic was really hard because I still had like 5 boxes filled with disposable I was resisting the urge not to burn through. But I managed to as I believe I have self control. But tbh I want to cut all drugs out of my life (including adderall but it really does help me with schoolwork), but I don't know how realistic that would be. I know that if i do it will limit if not stop the troubles I get myself in. But in a way I know I seek that thrill, and as I know I have the ability of self control, I know I can manage to smoke once in a while or drop tabs and still be successful/happy. And I\u2019m not saying that drugs are the only reason I have friends but that is the lifestyle they all have as well, and regardless of drugs my friends mean more to than most things so I\u2019m not going to just stop hanging out with them yk\u2026.",

    "content": "This story is very long best way for me to explain this is to start at the beginning, I'll be copying and pasting from my last post about this and using fake names. Also, keep in mind, I'm not the most mentally stable person around, and I grew up in the hood selling drugs, that lead up to me experimenting alot with them and then turned into me using alot.\n\nThis whole thing started at the tail end of Jan 2017,\nMe, my best friend Mike and Jake are in Skype call, Mike moans as a joke and I found it pretty hot because he both looked and sounded a decent amount like my old GF that I use to fuck with, and so this started my attraction to Mike, I get him in a private call after we finish up the convo with Jake and we both like saying we're going to sleep. And the night ended with me and Mike having basically phone sex. (I started experimenting with alot of stimulants, Adderall and Cocaine became the biggest out of the two) Around now was the time I started selling pretty large amounts, i started selling ounces of coke, This lead to two things, me making alot more money, and alot more girls where on me, this was when I met, Tracy and Amanda, the two girls who where I'll never forget because of how close they where and how often I was with them...\n\n\nNow it's about the middle of February,\nMike and I are  *extremely* suspicious of his now Ex GF cheating on him, to make this story as short as possible, she cheated on him and Mike is now emotionally broken, this girl was his first true love... That pissed me off to the point where I considered doing alot of fucked up shit to her, including raping her or brutally beating her (at this point I was on a daily routine of Cocaine and started experimenting with Oxycodone, so I wasn't thinking logically,) . Getting back to Mike now, he's broken to the point where he's bashing his head into walls to get to sleep when he can't cry himself to sleep, I offered to let him in on a 4some I was having with Tracy and Amanda, they where down for it and where even interested in seeing what type of best friend I had and how he'd fuck, he declined because he didn't want to be around drugs because he was scared of alot of things, like getting dependent on it to stay happy or forgetting about his ex, I understood but I strongly preferred being on coke and fucking than not being on coke, I couldn't budge on it, and neither could they. Mike is still depressed, crying pretty often and doesn't want to live anymore but doesn't have the drive to kill himself. This wasn't exactly his lowest point, both psychologly and physically.\n\n\nIt's now March, Michael hasn't changed at all, he's still as depressed as the first day, he stopped having phone sex with me because I assume he's too depressed to give it, and it was waring on his self esteem, he's still blaming himself for her cheating on him, that pushed me to interrogate his ex, she said that she just wanted something more and that Mike was good enough, she just made some bad choices, I damn near decked her right there. After this me and Mike talked, I told him that I wouldn't try to fuck his future girlfriend, even if she wanted me to. Rest of the month is pretty stale, aside from me nearly beating the fuck out of his girlfriend.(Oxycodone is now my go to drug for anything, I was on it around 20 hours of the day, I felt amazing)\n\n\nApril rolls around, Mike tells me that I should quit opioids and coke because it's effecting me too much, that I'm talking different and that I'm different as a person, I say I'll quit over spring break, I feel like absolute shit, this was the most depressed I've ever felt, it became suicide or oxycodone, Mike helped me when he could, he gave me words of encouragement and I think that pushed me far enough to quit Oxycodone for a few weeks and dropped my coke usage from a few ounces every 2 nights to an 8 ball every 3 nights\n\n\nAfter that hell of a month, came May, Mike devlops this new friend group they called \"The Lads\" strange name considering none of them are English and none of them even use lad on a consistent basis. Anyways, this group was mainly girls, I don't want to have to think of the names to use because it's another 5 people to add and, they're individually not important to the story, most important part about them is most of them want to date Michael. Mike starts to blow me off (not the way I wish he would) more often for them, I'm starting to feel neglected by him but I'm still doing coke, fucking Tracy and Amanda, so them mixed with coke is making me feel better about myself. Up to this point I've been thinking about Mike more and more often, i slowly started to realize how much I actually love him, I confess my love to him and I get my heart broken... this night I completely fell off, I think I nearly ODed on Opioids, this was the first time I ever shot up, it was around 25ml of morphine, it felt insane compared to my usual 60mg of ER Oxycodone orally. I fell in love with morphine, I went on a weeklong binge of morphine. I Decided had to stop injecting though because I started getting track marks, injecting felt so good though, it hit me so much faster and harder. It made me feel so amazing.\n\n\nAfter the most retarded bindge I've ever had, its now June, me and Mike start talking, he explains why, he gave me some pretty valid reasons like, he's not gay, and he doesn't want to get more sexually confused then he already is. I accept that, we're still alright, his current GF now comes into play, Mike and I are having a discussion, the lads come up, he asks me who would I date if I had the chance to, I said I'd totally date Cynthia, his current GF, he says he thinks she's pretty alright, so after a weekish now we 3 start talking, she quickly catches onto me liking Mike by what I say in chats with him she, Jake and Mike are the only people who know anything about me liking him. Mike and Cynthia start talking alone, Mike and Cynthia admit to each they have feelings, this was literally the one thing I was hoping to not happen, not because I don't want to see my boy happy, only because I wanted to be with him... one day we three are In a call together, me and Mike get into an argument over dumbshit, Cynthia suggests that our friendship is toxic, Mike says he wants to end our friendship, I almost ODed that night, Mike stopped me because he realized that he cares about me I realize I had to cut myself out of the hood life and had to cut myself out of Tracy's and Amanda's life because we 3 had serious drug habits. Now, I'm forced to quit semi-cold turkey.\n\n\nNow it's July\nluckily I was doing alot less then when I was bingeing morphine, it still was really fucking hard alot of suicidal thoughts and attempts, but Mike got me through it... Early on into the month Mike sent me a message saying he thanks me for being a friend because I was a damn good one, I couldn't believe it, at the end of the message he said he's having really bad chest pains and is having trouble breathing problems, I told him to call an ambulance, go to the hospital, he didn't want to wake his family up so he didn't, luckily he was fine, after that he went on a trip to Portugal for 3 weeks, since Mike was the glue that was holding me together mentally, him being gone for so long left me scarred, after Mike being gone for that long and being cold turkey off Opioids, I became alot more fucked up... I started fetishising rape, I started hearing voices, I lost my morality, I can't cry anymore, worst of all of them, I started molesting both Mike and Cynthia... It's so hard to type all of this out... I'm ashamed of what I've become.\n\n\nIt's August, mike and I have sleep overs for about a week straight, every night he forced me to sneak his GF out, the last night, was by far the worst... me and him where masked up and went  to get her out of her house, cops found us, wearing all black in the middle of the night, we almost got booked, then we decided let's cut through a park, another cop tells us to fuck off, now we're walking home and I'm pissed off because the cop almost IDed me and I would have had a lot of problems, night goes fine, then Mike and Cynthia fuck around and Mike ends up with a hickey. after on the first night they gave me their word they wouldn't,  I nearly choked her out right there... I ended up throwing her up against a wall and strangling her until her face turned a dark shade of purple, I would have kept at it until she fucking died but mike made me stop... he was so lucky I love him after that I almost stabbed her... So yea now Mike expects me to make his hickey go away, me and Cynthia ended up covering it up. Me and Mike had one last sleep over, I molested him alot, I thought he was fine with it because of what he told me... Around a week later he told me that he cried after I did it, it changed my whole prospective, his GF offered me her body under the table in exchange I never do anything to Mike again, I accepted it, I got cold feet, I got past it and made myself think that this is for Mike, she gets cold feet and I try to convince her by saying shit like \"it's not cheating if you don't like it\", \"this is for Mike isn't it?\" She tells Mike about this, and he lost trust in me, I almost ODed again, he convinces me not to, we meet, he doesn't tell me she's with us and now he sided with her the whole time, I went on a trip for the last week of august, I kept thinking about mike and where this leaves our friendship.\n\n\nNow here's the update to it, now it's September, school year starts up and so does my drug use and abuse. The reason I why I said use and abuse is because I never really got a high from adderall and I just used for its intended purpose, the abuse was more of just opiates. I'm using adderall to stay up 3 to 4 nights at a time on time crunches doing work. Mike and I are talking, he and I start talking about my sexuality and he comes to the conclusion that I'm bi, I'm fine with it because you can't change it, to fuck around I got some gay dating apps, every single guy  around here is 40 years old. So we scrap that idea, I find someone, that fizzled out in a week. Still want and can't shake how much I want mike. Back to the whole school thing, I'm doing more work, I end up getting a job offer working as an IT consultant for around 100$ per hour the day I get out of high school if I take Intro to Comp. Science, Java 1, and AP Comp. Science. Nothing else really happens here. It's basically me on adderall for 3-4 days at a time, then sleeping one and going on again. I start talking with Cynthia more, and more, about my mental problems and my addictions. I also threatened her telling her that if anyone ever heard about any of this, she can consider herself really fucking badly hurt, or raped. (Yes I know it's really nonsensical for me to tell her that but I just don't want to fuck up my public life) after all of this she's staying silent about it, scared, but silent. \n\n\nOctober is now upon us, adderall usuage went down because it's expensive and I stopped dealing. I can't tell if the voices got worse or if they've just gotten louder, but yea, Cynthia tells me that she's terrified of me and what I am. I like when people are scared of me, but I only like it when it's to a point where I still talk to them and control them to a certain extent. I start taking anti psychotics to help me control the voices and stop hurting mike and cynthia. Me, mike, and Cynthia with her brother go hang out, shit escalates a bit more then it should have. mike gets a bit too close to me, I tell him to back up, he doesn't, im on anti psychotics because it's not a school day. I'm a bit hyped up on some benzodrex that combined with the voices telling me to fight back I end up grabbing him by his throat and throwing him onto the ground, he starts fighting me, spins me by my shirt, I get back up, realize I shouldn't have done it, I don't fight back. He tells me to get some mental helps, walks off, Cynthia and her brother follow him. Her brother throws me his shirt since mines ripped. I called 2 dealer I know, I got my hands on morphine, and some alprazolam, I message mike and Cynthia, that I'm gone, I can't let myself hurt anyone else, I can't live without control over my life, I need to stop. Mike tells me to not do it, he couldn't handle it if I ODed. I'm depressed the rest of the night in the corner of my room with a syringe in my hand, they're telling me to just end it there, I don't want to hurt mike, the night didn't end for me, I never shot up, but they never stopped. They never do, not until I take anti psychotics. I'm on a downward spiral of alcohol because opioids are too expensive to buy on this much of a consistent basis. Anyways, I'm sober for a week or so, I fight with a kid I was trying to buy vyvance from he snitches on me, I get arrested because they found 40mg of adderall in my bag and the anti psychotics. The case most likely isn't going to trial because it's a first offense and I'm a minor. I got suspended out of school for 90 days, I tried talking to Cynthia, she tells me she's too terrified of me, and is scared that when I come back nothings going to change, I don't blame her, I just want her to be open to at least a business arrangement, because I'd rather pay her for my work instead of doing it myself. Now today, is Halloween, I wanted to kick it with mike and Cynthia, they're out with the Ladd's, I feel like I'm left alone with them now, I don't have anyone real left that tries to talk to me, it's become alot harder for me to keep doing this. Now I'm at a point where I'm getting ignored and I don't have anything left, no body knows my life. I need help, I just I need to know what to do from here because I know I'm a horrible person, I just don't want to loose either of the two people that are the closest to me. I'm sorry if some of this isn't coherent, it's 3 am I don't know where to go from this. I can't loose them man...",

    "content": "I\u2019m slender, 5\u20195. Fair skinned. With no body and facial hair. Baby faced. Sharp featured. Pink lips. Big Eyes and eyelashes. Silky hair. Firm poking tits. Big puffy pink sensitive tender areolas. Bubble butt. Wide Lovehandles. Wide hips. Perfect Hourglass. I look like the dream girl matrimonial ads and bollywood wants you to fap to and other girls envy about.  And most likely the girls you tend to fap to on porn sites. \n\nBut I have a penis. I\u2019m a Heterosexual boy below 19.    \n\nI have a condition called \u201cGynecomastia \u2013 or man boobs, moobs, lady lumps, bitch tits\u201d or whatever. My body is filled with estrogen which makes me look feminine. Doc and my counselor said it was in the genes but none of the males in my family seem to have this. I did research on my own and suspect that it could be BISPHENOL (a plastic). \n\nMy nickname was \u201cMilkman\u201d or \u201cDoodhwala\u201d (title christened to me by a girl in class 7). The following is what I got to hear from boys AND GIRLS while growing up. Some of them are like the comments you see on porntube.\n\n\u201cDude, you are turning into a girl !\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need a bra\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had your chest\u201d \u201cYour\u2019s are bigger than mine\u201d\n\n\u201cYuck, dude have you even looked at yourself in the mirror ? You have boobs. Theri aukat\u2026\u2026(blah) (blah)\u201d (First girl I proposed to)\n\n\u201cGross ! your buttocks are too big\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to use your bum as my pillow\u201d (after pillows were stolen from the bus)\n\n\u201cLook at those pink flowers\u201d (girl seeing me shirtless in pool)\n\n\u201cLift your shirt\u201d\n\n\u201cNice chest !\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I suck on those ?\u201d (and the question was rhetorical, he goes ahead without permission anyway)\n\n\u201cYour fat ass is selling hot\u201d (Translation of Teri Gaand bik raha hai)\n\n\u201cShut up or I\u2019ll squeeze your tits\u201d *chorus Laughter in the background* How every argument involving me ends. I was the class monitor, no one respected me. \n\n\u201cDude, can you lick those titties ?\u201d\n\n\u201cBable bai kaise ho? Padai kaisa chal raha hai\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201c Bhai, thuje weight kam karna hai, gym mat jai, height kam ho jaya football kelthe he\u201d (one of the more polite ones)\n\n\u2026.and on the playground \u201cBatle hila/dika/chooz gaandu\u201d. Reported it to my coach, he taps my ass and says \u201cloose weight\u201d. I show him my flat pack stomach, he laughs even further and moves away. \n\n\u201cYour breasts are very milky milky\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me massage your breasts\u201d (Two guys hold me while he films me getting rubbed shirtless)\n\nAND MUCH WORSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI lived in a hostel in boarding school, an \u2018international\u2019 one. I was harassed, had my tits squeezed/sucked, ass grabbed atleast once in two weeks, especially after bath or the playground BY BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS (although most harassers happened to be boys). Our school shirt was tight fitting, giving away my \u201cHot\u201d figure. I left the hockey team because, during summer we had to play shirtless and my teammates (and the coach) would often stare at my tits jiggling up and down while laughing. Some try to touch it. Once found a dude jerking off at me while I was in bath towel. I stopped taking bath when everyone else did, I started taking bath at night. Whenever I never wokeup, the dorm head senior used to squeeze my tits while I was asleep to watch my wake up in fright and then laugh at it.  \n\nMy juniors posted photos of my nipples being forcefully licked & twisted at dorm on facebook after tearing my shirt while I was sleeping in the dorm. Even girls \u2018liked\u2019 it and commented nasty, one of those girls included the crush I had a feelings for. That day I deleted my facebook and orkut. I told my relatives, it was because I wanted to concentrate on studies.\n\nI remember whenever we ran out of milk in the cafeteria, the girls would yell out \u201cDoodhwala, please refill the milk\u201d indirectly referring to me. Once the cook told that the milkman hasn\u2019t come, one of the girl, pinched my tits real tight, and said he is right here. I groped her back, she didn\u2019t like it and she moved away, never to talk to me again. \n\nAfter a lot of ignoring and playing along (laughing together with folks laughing at me), I got tired of it, I got into fights, but turned into laughing stock because I was too weak and alone while they were many. My punches and kicks were so weak and slow, that I looked like a cat trying to push lions with its paws. Everynight I lost a fight, I felt like picking up the knife from the kitchen and stab all those who groped me which included 35% of the boys and 7% of the girls in my class. Something like stabbing version of the mass shootouts you hear about in Murrica. \n\nI wished there were other boys with bitch tits so that time being molested by the bullies would have been shared by us both but unfortunately I was the only one. There are fat kids who have moobs, but they aren\u2019t made fun off much, because their chests were too saggy, unlike those of preteen girls. Mine was 75% breast tissue pointing towards the sky, so fat people joined in to make fun of me. I hogged as much as fast food as I can so I looked more fat instead of a skinny dude with tits and ass, but was still not turning fat, but instead I\u2019m making my butt grow more round and boobs grow more perkier. \n\nThere was a handicapped kid who was being made fun off by a bully, Teacher spotted it and told the bully to stop. I found a new ray of hope in her. I gathered courage to tell it to the teacher, when I told it, she laughed just like the folks harassing me. Being handicapped gains you sympathy, being a boy with bitch tits groped makes you a joke whom everyone can harass without consequences. And by the way even the handicapped kid used to laugh at me while people made fun of my lady lumps. Hate to generalize, but I started hating handicapped people from then on too. \n\nMy mom forced me to join swimming classes during holidays, boys and girls in the class made fun of me there too. Giggling behind my back. This included swimming instructors, pretending to unknowingly touch my chests and laugh. Boys who were 4 years younger than me tried touching my tits before I smacked the. I became paranoid, whenever I see someone staring at my chest, I feel nervous and sometimes I turn paranoid that someone is going to grope me from behind\u2013 like it used to happen a lot during school while we sat in queues. So I turn around to see who is behind very often.\n\nI try to make new friends but as soon as we get easy, almost every one of them have remarked about my feminine characteristics or grope me. I have been gropped in full public view by multiple people even in college, I have no respect I\u2019ve been the butt of jokes and have my own trademark \u2013 \u201cthe boy with boobs\u201d. I have contemplated suicide multiple times. HOWEVER, the anonymity of the internet saved me, letting me escape my identity through a make believe world where I can be who I want to be. \n\nEverytime I felt down, I watched The Shawshank redemption. I dreamt of going to a place where no human exists and pursue hobbies in music, but BC, I\u2019m too broke for that too. Instead I turned sadistic, everytime I heard news of people being killed, I rejoiced in joy, thinking there is one less potential harraser in this planet. Once, I saw another boy with tits similar to mine, He looked at me back too, in that glance, I felt like I met my twin after so many years, his stare reflected that we had the same experiences, I moved towards him but he ran away \u2013 that night I felt like I lost someone very close wondering why he ran away so fast. \n\nNow at college, thank god there is no dresscode. I never wear tight polo shirts or pants. I dress hip hop minus the gold chains. I never grow my hair. I sit at home and play video games, avoid going out. I always pray for winter to come and people obviously know that I wear winter clothes in summer to hide my tits. I always walk with a hunch. I bind my chest, lovehandles and ass together with that device which was supposed to make tummy look smaller.  Once a dude found it out, I told him it\u2019s a bulletproof vest and that my brother is in the army. Once in the college, I overheard women rating the boys in class, one of them mentioned how she found me cute but another remarked how I had breasts like a women because my hormones are fucked and feminine boys tend to be bad in bed (scientifically). That moment the other girl turned around, noticed me sitting and remarked \u201cShit!\u201d. I moved away from the scene. \n\nAfter holding it up for a long time, I told my parents like many had advised on the internet, but they don\u2019t seem to care \u2013 they say I need to reduce weight. Oh, and my sister laughed. I suspect society would have acted differently if I were a girl with tits instead of a boy. I came up with a new lie later to my family saying that I\u2019m not producing much sperms and need to go to a hormone specialist. I\u2019m taking medication and testosterone patches, hitting the gym, but it isn\u2019t working yet, I\u2019m just turning into those muscular girl models. I\u2019m too broke now after all the expenses on supplements, I\u2019m thinking of leaving college, working at a call center, saving money for a breast tissue removal and liposuction. If I mention surgery for this purpose, It would rise red alerts and news would spread as surgery for aesthetics is frowned upon, I will have to makeup another lie stating that I have breast cancer or something with fake documents after bribing a doc. \n\nIf any of you happen to be the boys and girls who harassed me, you\u2019d obviously remember. I would like to let you know that you did your part in ruining my life. I hope it gave you a lot of joy. I had plans to save up to buy a sniper rifle on the darkweb to hunt you all down, but don\u2019t worry, the plan is too impractical.\n\nAnother side of me, wants to accept the fact that I\u2019m a hermaphrodite or something. I try hard to turn Bisexual, but fail at all attempts.\n",

    "content": "I (27M) am lost in a limbo. First time poster. Please excuse any mistakes I might make. I live in a different city (than my hometown) with my girlfriend (26F). We live-in together. Our families know about our relationship but she refuses to let our families know about the live in arrangement. My family can be nosy and overbearing and her family is a bit conservative. I was fine with it. Lately, money has been very tight for n reason but I have always tried to maintain a budget. \n\nRecently, her brother got into some medical issues with his leg and Healthcare in her hometown is way below stellar. On the contrary, the city We stay in is popular for Healthcare. \n\nSo she suggested her mother and brother to come and get everything checked and fixed in our city. Problem is, they don't know we live in together and I need to leave the house for them to come in and stay since hotels are very expensive around here. I was completely understanding and agreed to move out temporarily to accommodate them in our home (rented). \n\nBut as mentioned previously, hotels are expensive and even the kind of shady and less than average motels which might have been an option are not an option since money has been very tight. I was drowning in credit card debt previously, and only last month I paid it all; partially asked from my mother, partially took a loan. I dont want to go drown in debt again, hence we were together asking around office colleagues and 1 or 2 friend we had in this city for me temporarily bunking with them. \n\nNothing worked.\nShe has one girl-friend in the city who lived alone. I suggested we try that. I understand it might be frowned upon staying alone with another single lady, but money has been an issue for the longest time. My gf understood that and we called her. Initially the friend was hesitant, but with some coercion, she agreed. The friend used to bunk with us at our place almost every weekend and go clubbing or drinking.\n\n So me and my gf decided I would bunk with her for sometime. My gf mentioned that she might have a crush on me, but I said that even if she does, I will always maintain a physical distance so that she can't try any funny business. My gf agrees and I go on to bunk with my gf's girl-friend. Cut to her family coming and after a few days, she starts behaving weirdly. \n\nI ask my gf what's she on about, and she says she's insecure about our future as she thinks I might cheat on her. I have tried assuring her quintuple times that I'm only in love with her. It was a temporary fix. But she is critically hard on herself that everything is her fault and she insists that after her brother's medical procedure, nothing will be the same between us. Today on valentines day, shit hit the fan. We were supposed to meet outside today for a movie. Since I had no leaves left, I snuck out of our office and I required my laptop for any last minute work, so I took my gfs girl-friend's spare bag to carry the laptop.\n\n After a movie we watched together, she saw the bag was not mine and flipped. I tried reasoning with her, but she was adamant that everything is beyond repair. One more thing I think I should mention: my gf loves drama. So the friend has a bf. My gf wants to know why they keep on fighting all the time (open secret). So last night I probed and the friend spilled the beans about the issue. \n\nThat's all separate story. I told my gf that hoping she would appreciate me, but she thinks the friemd and me were having a heart to heart. After the movie, shit hit the ceiling. I have tried everything, but admittedly I lost my cool finally and said some pretty hurtful things as well. \n\nShe was hurt and sometime within the argument she said I could have atleast stayed someplace else on VDay (it being our love anniversary as well, 6 years) Now I have left after saying a lot of hurtful things (she also said) and now I'm in a below average bar (the kind family avoids) for the first time, drinking (not the first time) my body weight of cheap ass liquor which I have never touched in my life. I dont know what to do or where to go from here. Please help with any advice or criticism you may have.\n\nEdit: Should I go to the friend's house where all my supplies are or should I compromise and stay in my office since today is the 6th Anniversary and return tomorrow for my stuff?\n\nEdit 2: The friend sleeps on her bed. I sleep on a mattress on the floor in the same room. There are only two rooms and only one of them has a working fan. No ac.",

By the time it was my tenth birthday my dad had announced his relationship with \u201cM\u201d, my soon to be step mother. \nBy all accounts, my mom was the kindest woman people had met. Raised in France, she became a nun at her 18th birthday and later met my father who was in Seminary (school to become a priest). They both ended up leaving religious life and a he later moved to the USA and became a citizen.\nMy fathers new wife had also been a nun but was born and raised in Mexico. She was raised to be a \u201cgood woman\u201d by taking care of the house and her younger siblings. To not speak up against her parents and to prioritize the home. She was also physically abused, once telling me about how her mother threw a log at her head, causing her to fall down a hill and be unconscious for 5 minutes. This was for saying no to her mother. She explained this to me implying that she deserved it and was grateful for it. \nIn the beginning of her relationship with me, M was like a friend to me, but this later became unacceptable in the house and I was supposed to see her as an authority figure. Things began to devolve and continued to do so as I communicated my lack of faith and bisexuality. She began calling me stupid and claimed I was unable to complete simple tasks like doing the dishes properly or cleaning my room. I was 12 at this point. \nThings continued to progress as she insulted my body and consistently told me I was doing things wrong even if I did it exactly how she said. She also began to slap me, hit me, make me kneel for long periods of time, pulled my hair to the point that I couldn\u2019t touch my scalp for hours, and invaded my privacy. Now, I make no claim to be the perfect child but I wasn\u2019t the craziest teenager (sneaking out to go down the street to watch Netflix at a friends house being my worst \u201ccrime\u201d) and did gradually get better at household things over time. \nWhen I approached my dad about how the things she said made me feel and about the physical abuse, he dismissed my emotions, blamed me, and said I shouldn\u2019t expect her to change her culture for an \u201cAmerican\u201d way of raising kids. \nThe verbal abuse has continued till now and I\u2019m going to be moving out soon for college. CPS has been involved but did nothing and my dad has also done very little. She is still mean and the standards are continuously being raised.\nSo, am I the asshole for not respecting my stepmoms culture?",

    "content": "Hi everyone. I have a really complicated situation and I need advice. \n\nI, 24 F, have a brother, who is 37, and he is about to be a father in a month to a baby boy. I have some major concerns about the safety of his baby and baby momma. My brother is diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder with delusions and has been struggling with it for almost 20 years. He has been in and out of treatment facilities, and has been supported by family for a long time. Over the years, he has burned almost every bridge with members of my extended family, because he seems to have no regard for how his disorder affects those around him and he is unable, or maybe even unwilling, to treat his mental illness. \n\nAbout 3 years ago, he had a major manic episode. I know him very well, so I noticed he was manic the second he presented symptoms. However, I didn\u2019t do anything or say anything. A couple weeks after I noticed his symptoms, he was pushing his girlfriend\u2019s dog around and the dog bit him. This sent him into the most dangerous and aggressive episode that he has ever had. He tore cabinets off the walls and doors off the hinges, and barricaded the windows and locked the doors in his girlfriend\u2019s house. She was able to leave and stay with family, and called the police. Eventually my sister was able to get him to willingly go with the police officers, and his girlfriend broke up with him and pushed for him to get sent to the state mental hospital. He was admitted and stayed there for a couple of months until he was released. Since then, he has continued to use my family for financial support and housing while at the same time taking zero accountability for his actions.\n\nAround 10 months ago, he met another girl. He immediately moved in with her and her family and they got pregnant within two months of knowing each other. Now, she is 8 months pregnant. I just met her over the weekend, and she seems like a very nice person, but is also very naive. She said that my brother will often keep them up until 3AM talking about conspiracy theories, and my brother kept repeating to me that \u201cwe\u2019re all in a simulation and it\u2019s just the matrix\u201d. I am 100% certain that he is in a manic episode.\n\nWe went for a swim in the lake at my mom\u2019s house, and while we were swimming his girlfriend was acting like she was gonna get me in the water. I set a very firm boundary to not touch me, and she immediately stopped. However, my brother then pushed her under the water as a \u201cjoke\u201d. Keep in mind that she is 8 MONTHS PREGNANT!!! She started coughing up water and had to swim to shore. She had a panic attack and said that her brother did that to her when she was a kid and she almost died. I think that she almost died again!\n\nI am very concerned about what is going to happen when the newborn is here and my brother loses a lot of sleep. I am afraid that he is going to hurt his girlfriend and the baby. I am scared that if she hasn\u2019t noticed his symptoms now, that when she will it will be too late.\n\nMy question is, should I tell her my brother\u2019s history and risk the fallout, and even possibly losing access to my new nephew altogether, or should I stay silent and supportive to ensure I\u2019m in the baby\u2019s life?\n\nEDIT:\n\nShe reached out to me unprompted and said that my brother was getting really angry and that he was throwing stuff. At this point I told her about his past and called the police. The police didn\u2019t do anything because he hasn\u2019t physically touched her. She is now thinking about kicking him out and leaving him off the birth certificate.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1epyyh8/debating_moving_out_when_i_turn_18_very_long_story/",
    "content": "Note: most of this post in context of the situation. The actually question and dilemma is towards the bottom\n\nI turn 18 next month, which is the beginning of my senior year in high school. You may be wondering why I feel the need to \"debate\" if I'm going to move out since I will be a legal adult and can do whatever I want by that point. For most of my childhood, at least of the years I can remember, I have constantly been wondering who was lying to me. I could not tell if the rest of my family was crazy or if my mother (who I lived with) was crazy. Now that I am older, I've begun to realize that all of them are a little off due to their own upbringings, but my mother is the most crazy/toxic. I mean, it makes sense because it's rare that everyone turns against one person for no reason. That person must have done something to make everyone in the family standoffish towards them.\n\nSo why is this coming up now? I've come to the conclusion through years on online research that my mother is probably emotionally manipulative and/or a narcissist (take this with a grain of salt. this was all self researched and probably biased). Like I said, I spent the majority of my childhood wondering who was lying to me. I could go into all of the things she said to me as a child and how that has affected me in my near adulthood, but I don't know how I would even discuss all of that in a way that is understandable. The basis is that my mother raised me and my 8 year older sister on her own. My sister eventually began to distance herself from my mother (and by association, me) for reasons I could not fully understand when I was younger. My mother convinced me that my sister was poisoned by college, that my sister was depressed, that her boyfriend was turning her against us, that my sister was hateful to my mother because my mother knew her the best, etc etc. There was a lot going on in my mind and there still is.\n\nOver these past few days, my sister and I have done a lot of talking after months of not speaking. We stopped talking after my sister purchased me a driving course without telling my mom. Our reasoning for not telling her is because we knew my mother would be upset about it, but jesus I'm 17 and I struggle to ask for things, but I needed to learn to drive!! I still don't know how. The plan was for my sister to buy the course, me do the course and take the online exam to get my certificate, and then I would show the certificate to my mother and me and my sister would go to the dmv to get my driver's permit at our next family gathering. We were hoping our mom would be so excited about the certificate that she wouldn't be upset about my sister buying me a driving course for my birthday. (yes, it was a birthday gift, so it has almost been a year).\n\nMy mom did not really acknowledge my success in getting the certificate, and instead snapped at me about \"going behind her back.\" Did we go behind her back? Yes, but we had plenty of reasons to do so. Our mother convinced us (or rather me) that we were awful, conniving kids who were always going behind her back to do things. I felt really guilty after that, and began to distance myself from my sister, thinking that she was always getting me in trouble. My mother then told me that she put my sister in her place over text.\n\nA month or so ago, my sister announced in the (extended) family group chat that she was pregnant. We all congratulated her (I felt weird about it because I don't really understand kids, but even so I was respectful and congratulated her because that's what a good person does when someone announces good news). My mother? She didn't acknowledge it at all to anyone but me. To me, she went on a rant about how hurtful it is for my sister to not have told our mother first since she raised her and owed it to her. My mother believes that she deserves to know everything in my sister's life first, despite the fact that they don't talk to each other. The extent of their interactions are at family gatherings or when my sister is sending my mother the money for her phone bill. (idk why my sister is still on our phone bill. I think it's a family plan and my mom told her she could stay on it. My sister is currently trying to get off of it but my mom was being slow about doing things on her end).\n\nFlash forward to a couple weeks ago: my sister messages me out of blue telling me that she and her fiance are having to put their dog up for adoption and they're pretty upset about it. I tell mom \"Aww (sister's name) is having to get rid of her dog because they can't handle him anymore.\" (the dog was a young dobermann and needed mental and physical stimulation they couldn't provide. He broke 2 of their doors lmao). My mom asks a few brief questions about why they're getting rid of the dog and how we got on the subject before quickly changing the topic. She says \"ask (sister's name) if she told me about her pregnancy.\" I did what she asked, knowing damn well that she saw the message and we discussed it. My sister said she hadn't told our mom directly, and mentioned that she and my step dad (my mother got married last year, this is important later) were both in the group chat and should have seen it. Mom told me to say \"Mom and (step-dad) don't really check those group chats, so she may not have seen it,\" which I did say. However, by this point I was tired from my mother using me as a messenger for so many years, so I put in parentheses something like \"(mom saw the message the day you sent it, but she's telling me to say this. just fyi.)\" Our mother doesn't know that my sister knows, keep this in mind.\n\n(Note: Shortly after that conversation, my household found out that our new puppy was sick and needed surgery or he would die in a few days. He has had the surgery and is fine now, but you can imagine how emotionally draining that was for us. He currently has staples in his stomach, a cone on his head, and a little hospital gown on. This will be important later.)\n\nA few days later (i think?), I got a message from my sister at around 9 in the morning about a text conversation she had with our mother that morning. She asks me what our mother says behind her back because she said some very cruel things during their conversation. Before I can even respond, my mother walks in my room (I had just woke up, it's way too early for this come on). She shows me the messages with a smile on her face saying my sister was being outrageous. I guess she wanted me to take her side? I don't have an image of the messages, but they said something like \"congrats on the pregnancy. I'm kind of sad I had to hear about it from (my name) since I'm your mother. I wish you had told me first. I hope that you wanted this baby and that you are genuinely happy about it.\" which is a crazy thing to say to a pregnant woman imo, but okay mom. My sister calls her out on her bluff and points out that she and my stepdad were both in the group text. She also said she doesn't owe my mother to tell her things first because they hardly even talk to each other. My mother lies and says that she doesn't check the group chats so she didn't see the message (but remember, I told my sister before that this was a lie). This leads into a small argument, which ends with my mother disowning my sister and saying she's disappointed in her and that she should show her own mother some respect. At some point in the thread, my sister even told my mother to \"leave her alone\" because my mother is always criticizing my sister's life.\n\nMy mother expected me to side with her, but I sided with my sister and told her that she was being cruel. Within the back and forth between my mother and my sister, my mother tried to make it seem like she was \"just congratulating my sister on her pregnancy\" when it's very clear that she was picking a fight and trying to make my sister feel guilty. When I sided with my sister, my mother said something along the lines of \"huh. well now I know that both of my children have a weird way of thinking about things.\" I would also like to add that my step-father sides with my mother on this matter, as he does with most matters.\n\nIn the following days, me and my sister have been talking about my mother. I told my sister all of the things my mother has told me about her. My sister told me that all of those conversations were lies and that she didn't even know our mother had been saying those things. (Some of these lies ranged from my sister refusing to help pay rent when she came home for covid, my sister's highschool counselor convincing her not to go to college for theater, and my sister hiding the fact that she dropped out of college, but of course there were many more. I found out that none of these things were true). My sister even told me that she found out from the rest of my family that my mother has been lying about who my sister's father is. Up until now, we thought he was a man in prison, and my sister has been talking to this false father and his family for years. My sister also showed me the message my mother sent her after finding out about my driving class. The message was essentially my mother telling my sister that she was a disappointment, she was not allowed to make decisions for me, and that she was overstepping. When my sister asked why this was an issue, my mother essentially said \"because I am her mother\" \"because I said so\" and \"if you dont understand why this is wrong, just go ask any other parent and they will tell you.\" She didn't offer any explanation for her reaction. When my sister kept asking questions, my mother told her she was done with the conversation and did not want to discuss it anymore. She then came back 2 hours later to disown my sister and tell her that she was behaving like a stranger and that \"I have been nothing but a good mother to you, and this is how you treat me?\" She also called my sister a messy liar that was not the same person anymore.\n\nMe and my sister talked about a lot of the things my mother had said to both of us, and it validated both of our separate experiences. Some of our experiences were so similar that it was almost scary. It seems to us that our mother got upset when she realized she was losing control of my sister, so she tried to pit me against her. She used the lies she told me about my sister to get me to behave a certain way.\n\nOk, now we can talk about what just happened yesterday that has pushed me to the edge (I'm sorry this post has been so long. We're in the home stretch, I swear!)\n\nRemember: My 5-6 month old puppy currently has staples in his stomach from the surgery he got last week. Also, my mother got married last year in august to my stepfather. I wasn't even old enough for pre school the last time my mother was married, which was an abusive marriage that ended with us running away when he wasn't home (from what my mother tells me. Not sure what I believe at this point though). Now, let me tell you about my step-father's dog.\n\nPossible trigger warning for animal abuse (both physical and neglect)\n\nI've discussed the puppy that just got surgery, but there was actually an older dog in our house up until yesterday. My step-father just his dad a few months ago, and it really messed with him as you would expect. This other dog (a pit bull) was a dog he got as a puppy from his father. When my step-dad got out of the military, his dad gifted him this puppy. That was about 5 years ago (i think. my math is bad sometimes). Before me and my mother moved in last May, this dog was living lavish. He was allowed to roam through the house freely, he was shown constant love by my stepfather, and he became my step father's emotional support animal to a degree. Since me and my mother moved in, this dog has been essentially losing his rights. First, my mother banished him from the bedrooms because she did not want his scent in the carpet. Then, my mother took his favorite rug out of the living room (also because of the smell). Then, my mother tried to convince my step father to make the dog into an outside dog. Finally, she banished the dog to a small bathroom at the front of the house, which is the opposite side of the house from where the living room is that everyone hangs out in. He was hardly ever let out, unless it was to eat, go to the bathroom, or if they wanted him to hang out for a few minutes. He spent most of his time laying down in that bathroom. The puppy spent most of his time in his empty cage that he did not have enough room in.\n\nMy mother does not physically discipline me. My mother physically disciplines the dogs. If the dogs whine, no matter what the reason, she yells at and hits them. If the dogs keep stepping in front of her blocking her way, she yells at and hits them. This includes **SHOCK AND BARK COLLARS BEING USED IRRESPONSIBLY ON EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS!!!** In the beginning my step father physically disciplined the dogs too, but only if they did something **REALLY BAD** (no matter what, I don't agree with physical discipline). As a result, he disapproved of the way my mother treated the dogs. However, over the course of this past year my step father has become more lenient and approving of her behavior, often engaging in it himself. My step father is a very soft hearted and loving guy, so he was very gentle with the dogs most of the time. My mother convinced him that he was too sensitive. In her mind \"they're dogs. you can't treat them like humans\" or \"they're made of full muscle, they can hardly even feel this pickle ball paddle/belt/wooden stick that I've hit them with multiple times.\" My mother would hit the dogs as \"discipline\" until they were screaming and crying for help. This includes the 5 month puppy, who currently has stitches in his stomach. She beat him with a wooden spoon until it split down the middle. Vertically. When it broke, she switched to the paddle. Heaven forbid the puppy pees in the crate when he's excited to see you! Heaven forbid they whine out of boredom or to tell you they're hungry or need to go to the bathroom! How dare they!\n\nYesterday, I was awoken to the sound of the puppy being beaten, something I've been awoken to multiple times. My guess is that he peed in the crate or walked ahead of my mother when she was getting ready to feed him. My step father had driven to the next city to run an errand, but he would be back that afternoon. I was bringing my mother her coffee because she'd forgotten it in the kitchen. The bathroom the older dog was banished to was right in front of my mother's office, so when I passed the bathroom, I noticed the dog had peed everywhere. I told my mother about this, which I greatly regret, but she would have noticed eventually. My mother stormed to her room and came back with a belt, and she beat him with it multiple times past the point of him screaming. I guess he showed her his teeth and tried to jump up on her growling (at least that's what we've been told), because she started hitting him harder and ran him to the back door. I was sitting on the couch next to the back door, hearing all of this from afar, and I watched as she hit him the entire time he was running to the back door. She ran him off into the back yard and wouldn't let him on the porch. She set up a barrier and beat him again anytime he came onto the porch. She told me to watch him and tell her if he came back on the porch (which I obviously did not do. Why would I help her time and beat our dog?) so I went to my room.\n\nI start messaging my friend about the whole situation and we have a back and forth conversation about our mothers (we have very similar lives and carbon copy mom's, so it's comforting talking to them). While I'm doing this, I hear the dog and my mom outside screaming again. I walk to the back door (which is glass) and I see her pinning him down in a corner on the porch with a metal folding chair yelling at him. On top of that, she has a large wooden stick/pole that she is hitting and jabbing him with (hitting and jabbing him very hard). I later found out that he tried to bite her (allegedly).\n\nShe called my step father, who was almost home, to tell him what happened. When he gets home, he's furious and he beats the dog again. They then put him in a cage that was practically the same size as him (his back was almost touching the top, he could hardly turn or sit, his only option was to lay down or stand). They do not bring this cage inside, they leave him out in the yard in a cage with no covering and hardly any water. It was the heat of the day, we were under heat **ADVISORY** and I live in **TEXAS!!** It has been\u00a0 around 100 degrees every day.\n\nThere was nothing I could really do for him without getting myself in massive trouble (I know this from experience). My parents went into the garage and sat out there with the puppy. I went back to my room to continue my conversation with my friend. The dog was out there from 12pm to 5 pm, and I could hear him barking from time to time. It wasn't his normal bark though, it was more high pitched like he was crying for help or was in pain. I would go look at him from the window every once in a while to see how he was, and he was shaking with every movement he made, and he never stopped panting. There was a moment where my mother called me into the living room laughing because my dog was sitting on his butt like a human. My parents were laughing at our dog who was clearly distressed. My step dad even sent a picture of him in this position to me and my mother saying \"when punishment is felt.\" It was disgusting and hurtful.\n\nThe entire time he was out there, they hardly checked on him, and they only gave him water once. At around 5 oclock, I heard my step father shouting from the backyard and my mother sounding really confused. I walked out of my room and asked what was up and my mother said \"(step father) said (the dog) is dead).\" And yes. He was dead and still is dead.\n\nMy step father of course threw a fit. Of course his was pissed, although it was on a level we had never seen before. This was his dog that he raised. The dog he got from his recently deceased father when he came home from the military. Of course he's fucking pissed, but my mother kept saying \"he's belligerent right now.\" **NO SHIT MOTHER! I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU AREN'T!!** Me? I was calm, but that's because I don't like to express my unfavorable emotions in front of others. I was also calm because I knew this day would come, and I had already detached my emotions from him. I just wasn't sure when or which dog it was going to be. Why did I know this day would come? Because it's happened many times before. Every dog I've ever owned has been killed by my mother in some way. My first dog was left outside over night because my mother wanted to giver her away. She dug out under the fence and was hit by a car. My second dog was hard to train, and my mother hated him for it. He was also our first pitbull, so she was slightly afraid of him. With this dog? She did so much. She beat him, similar to our others. She put him outside in a small cage for **WEEKS** and never let him come inside. In that cage, he sat in and ate his own filth. He wasn't beat when he barked or whined though. No no no. Instead, my mother poured pots of boiling water on him multiple times a day (not warm. boiling. fresh off the stove). She did this so often that he developed a skin infection and his skin would leak puss. She refused to admit this was a result of the torture she had been putting him through, because in her mind her actions were completely normal and sane. She eventually abandoned him at the park (he was still sick by the way). Then, at the beginning of the year we took in my younger step-sisters dog because her mom wanted to get rid of him. He was abused and tortured for \"bad behavior\" as well. He was tied up to some rocks outside where he could barely move. He would try to jump over them out of fear, to the point that he scraped up his body (very badly) and ripped a lot of his fur out. She also tried putting him in a cage outside over night and during thunderstorms. She would then bring him inside and treat him gently until he messed up again. Essentially she instilled Stockholm syndrome into out dogs, and I'm beginning to wonder if she did the same to me and my sister. That dog was abandoned in an under construction residential neighborhood. I'm so sorry if this post is traumatizing you guys, I really am, but it's important for you to understand where I'm coming from and what my dilemma is.\n\nWhen our dog died yesterday, my parents tried to contact animal control but they did not answer. As a result, my parents took the body and buried it (??? im not really sure what they did. they may have just left him wrapped up.) near the graveyard. This morning, an animal control officer came to our house after finding the body. He questioned my parents, and they lied to him. They left out important detail about what happened yesterday. They told him that the dog peed in the bathroom and then snapped at them. They said he hasn't been acting like himself lately (he's been standing up for himself lately and begging for attention by whining alot). They told him that when my step father got home, he had a \"talk\" with the dog. They didn't tell the officer that they **BOTH** beat him. They didn't tell him that the dog was locked in the bathroom most of the time either. They told him that they put him outside. The officer asked \"does he have a doghouse? in texas, you can't leave your dogs outside in the heat of the day, it's against the law. Also, patio coverings do not count as shelter for a dog in Texas.\" They told him that the dogs don't have dog houses because they're indoor dogs and dont spend much time outside (this is true). He asked to see the backyard and they showed it to him. They recently redid our backyard, so it's very comfortable out there. Plus the patio itself is very large, has seating, a rug, and a fan. The officer saw this and was like \"oh, it feels really nice out here actually, especially with the fan. You guys seem to be a loving family, and his living conditions seem to have been pretty good too.\" Wrong officer. They didn't tell you that the dog was **OFF THE PORCH**. He was out in the grass, in a small cage with no water. He wasn't on our nicely cooled porch like they're leading you to believe. They also told him that the dog was only outside for about two ours, so they don't know why he overheated. As I said earlier, I just checked our house cameras. The dog was outside from 12 to 5. That's 5 hours with one bowl of water after being beat multiple times. He could have died from a multitude of things (injury, stress, overheating, etc). So, my family has been let off without any punishment.\n\nI think the worst part about this is that neither of them think this was their fault. They both seem to think that it's the **DOG'S FAULT**. They have spun this narrative in their heads that \"When we took him the water, he gulped it down really fast. He probably overwhelmed his body and caused his heart to burst.\" **WHERE IS THIS EVIDENCE??** Neither of them admit to being abusers. Neither of them have really mentioned him much either. He died quietly, and life has just kept going. It feels so strange because nothing has changed. I hardly saw him anyway because he was always in the bathroom, so I would sometimes forget he was there. Last night was one of the worst nights of my life. I was in and out of sleep, paranoid and anxious, because I felt unsafe. I felt like I was going to close my eyes and he or someone else would be there staring at me when I opened them. I even locked my bedroom door, which is something I'm not allowed to do. I fell asleep at one in the morning and woke up at 7, unable to fall back asleep. Every sound made me jump, I turned on a super bright lamp, my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was awful.\n\nBefore I went to bed, my mother came to tell me goodnight. She told me \"I didn't get to do anything I had planned to do today because (the dog) interrupted me this morning. The whole day has been about him, so I had to drop everything I was doing. Today has kind of been stolen from me.\" I want to add to the list: I think my mother might be a genuine psychopath. As in by definition psychopath. Her lack of remorse or guilt, her self centeredness, it scares me. And I'm so accustomed to it that all I can do is roll my eyes and laugh along until she shuts up and leaves.\n\n**THE QUESTION:**This brings me back to my reason for posting here (again, I'm very sorry for the dark story.) I was updating my sister and my friend as things were happening yesterday. I had to quietly send my sister a voice memo through my shaky breath because I knew my mom would be mad I told anyone. She advised me to secretly pack my things and move in with a family member when I turn 18. This sounds great and all, but I would feel guilty (I know it's dumb, but I really can't help feeling guilty for leaving my mom when she's under the impression that she's done nothing wrong). This is because my mother has made a lot of plans for us in the coming year and is working really hard to create businesses and earn money so me and my siblings can have it easy when we are adults. On top of that, me and my friend had plans to work at one of my mothers businesses (it's a call center) when we turned 18. If we are unable to do that, it throws a wrench into my other plans. I also doubt that she would help me pay for college if I were to move away, so I would probably have to list myself as an independent on financial aid and the FAFSA. I also don't want to burden whoever I move in with because I am the youngest person in my family. That means that all of my older family members were done parenting/supporting people years ago, and it would be rude of me to ask them to support me (I doubt they would say no, but I know I would be inconveniencing them. I debated applying for emancipation, but I am a broke 17 year old with no job. Where in the world would I go? I really want to get out of this situation, but I also think I might be able to handle one last year here if I tried. Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation or what you did in a similar situation? I have so many things to worry about, especially finances and college applications, and it's seriously stressing me out. I hope that this doesn't get snuffed out as a rant, because I genuinely need advice here and I don't know where else I would post this (please let me know of any other sub reddits that I could post this in to get advice, I would really appreciate it).\n\n",

    "content": "  \n\nHello!\n\nDue to very hard life circumstances I feel the need to open up and write this here. I know there are people doing worse then I do, but the pain given by a certain situation is different from human to human.  \n For anything to make any sort of sense, I need to do something similar to \u201cdraw my life\u201d without the \u201cdrawing\u201d part.\n\nI was born in a big city, 20 years and something ago; 1 year after birth due to some unfortunate events, my mother left me, so for a while I grew up with my grandmother, my father and my grandfather.  \n At some point my father left too and I was left with my grandmother and grandfather, he was an alcoholic and was frequently beating her (my grandmother), I remember one time when he ripped off a leg from a coffee table and hit her in the mouth, after that we were both on a stone in front of our yard, she had a huge bruise on her face and she was crying. She resisted heroically, but that\u2019s not the only time he tortured her, she has heart problems, one time he took her pills, leaving her to die from heart attack, after 3 days one neighbor realized something was wrong and saved her, she was inches away from a heart attack, but that neighbor saved her, and beat the crap out of him. The worst trauma I have from that period was when he tried to stab her with a knife, my father was there and beat the crap out of him.. I remember everything frame by frame to this day, I was about 3-4 by then.  \n On a x-mas eve he threw all the food she prepared and kicked us both out of the house. I remember that we were dress a tiny little better then 2 homeless persons but we went inside a Carreffour (European super market chain) to stay at warmth, and we\u2019ve found  some guy giving presents to kids, he was dressed like santa, he saw me and called me in, and I asked for some cereals :)) I don\u2019t really remember this part but I trust my granny, the santa paid himself for 2 bags full of stuff since the gifts were really small, bless his soul. At this point we went back home, since he fell asleep and she had some backup keys always with her (survival skills), only thing I remember is that close after this santa event, she woke me up very early in the morning and we left the house and went to my great grandmother (her mother) since she was still alive and living in the countryside. We got onto a big bus with a couple of bags, mostly clothes and I was about 5 at this point, I was holding only my favorite toy, a toy train.   \n When we got there my great granny was really bad from being alone, so much so that her mouth was crooked (I guess is the right term), she had pretty much no friends and loneliness had his way with her poor soul.  \n We\u2019ve moved there, she recovered quickly her mouth recovered too, I was raised by my granny and great granny, I wasn\u2019t really a problem kid, I did have few mistakes here and there, influences that remained from my grandfather (since he was teaching me to be mean with my granny) but after few months all was gone, I was a very lonely kid, never had any friends or go out and play since I was always bullied for not having a mother or a father (he was still out of my life at this point) and being raised by 2 grannies. So my depressive period began.  \n My father remarried a woman from another small mountain town in the meantime, and he had a few fights with my grans, at some point he wanted to take our TV (that was bought by my gran and was by all means hers, also the only TV) I remember to this day how my gran picked up her son and hit his head against the room ceiling. He also wanted to take me; me, having no true emotional connection with him, wasn\u2019t happy at all, I loved my grannies, not him, and it\u2019s still valid through this day. He took me in the end, I had one year in kindergarten with him and his new wife. It was horrible, they were living with her parents too, and they really hated me, barely letting me even eat or touch their stuff (I was 7 y.o. god dammit), I didn\u2019t speak to my granny for almost a year, since I didn\u2019t have a phone, but one day, near x-mas I asked to and they let me talk to her, when I heard her voice I broke down in tears in an instant and begged her to come and take me home, and, few days later she came, and took me home promising that she will never let le leave again (spoiler: she kept the promise) I never loved his new wife, I hated her parents and I never loved him, the only good thing was that I made 2 friends, their dog, miss that guy, and one colleague from kindergarten that was my kind of weirdo, we were studying fluid dynamics before we knew the term :)) unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to keep a connection with him and we\u2019ve never spoken again since I left.\n\nWent back to kindergarten in the countryside, the same one, and I was a good kid starting then, I became the smartest one of my age in the school at science and computers since this is that I always loved. After a few years my father moved with us at the countryside since they divorced, mostly because of her parents.\n\nI have some mixed feelings about everything after he moved with us. He was this tough guy that got into many troubles when he was young, on the other hand he was trying to be a father, no kidding, he is quite similar with Kratos from God Of War IV (so be careful when you wish for a father like him) but credit where credit is due, he didn\u2019t have the god part, and he didn\u2019t have the Leviathan axe, he was always in a stupid competition with me, one time I got a tablet from my uncle and he didn\u2019t talk to me for a few weeks because of that, he wanted to take it from me, but both my grannies said \u201cno\u201d, he also didn\u2019t have a job ever since.\n\nHe had heart problems and epilepsy because of his father traumatizing him, and somehow in our family \u201cYour feelings don\u2019t matter\u201d became some kind of rune everybody worshipped. He was really tough with me, always disappointed I was this quiet kid, passionate with science, playing in dirt and later electronics and electronics engineering.I was 12-13 years at this point, and I managed to make a friend online, witch it still with me to this day, interesting are the internet\u2019s ways.  \n years passed, I got into 8th grade, was about to go to high school, in the meantime I discovered that I might also be gay so yeah, my grandfather died so the house from the big city was available and my father\u2019s brother I guess my uncle, was sponsoring with cash the renovation of that house and he wanted me to get better education in that big city. My father forced me to go to a high school for chefs and waiters while I wanted to be a train driver or an electronics engineer. After some fights I gave up and accepted also forced by my gran because she knew how important is to get the proper education.\n\nI moved to that city with my father only and this is where true hell begins, but beware because this is where the story breaks into many different events and timelines. Got to a new place, still depressive, new classmates, just starting to discover I am gay, my father was getting more and more of an idiot. To spare you from 30m of reading (although if you got this far, I am impressed and happy) word got out in my high school that I am gay, eventually my father found out, right before that I ran away to my granny, my father was threatening me that he will kill me and stuff like that, while a 55 yr old and 85 yr old woman was able to understand that I am gay and accept without any hesitation, my gran even gave me money to hang out with one of my past boyfriends. But this is only half of the story, since I moved there I had to make money myself because even if my uncle sent money for me, they were used by my father for booze and cigarettes, so for many things, including food partially I had to work repairing computers or something. I got really drepessed. I had no friends, my gran was 65km away, no money, no family basically. I turned to satanism\u2026 yeah.. I don\u2019t know why I did it, I am out of it now. One day on a gay dating app I met this guy, let\u2019s call him Andy. We\u2019ve chatted for a while, and we\u2019ve met in a park, when I saw him I instantly fell into the deepest love I ever felt, and it still holds up today, he introduces me to another understanding of spirituality (he is why I left satanism) I begin to understand and see more, I had an explosion of perception, became more ok, I was seeing and understanding way more then I ever was, I became happy for a while. (I fell in love before he got me out of my shit) but he was seeing himself as some sort of spiritual leader with a mission and he didn\u2019t have the time to love or something. That made him very cold, harsh and he had a hell of a superior attitude, but I was loving him the same anyway. Over the month and years we had quite a few fights, I gave up wanting a relationship with him, but I was still in love deeply with him. After some years his life has changed too, and he was about to leave for Poland in some kind of program, for a year, before that he visited me, I sneak him in my room (my room was separate from the rest of the house, even the heating was separate, my father had heating, I didn\u2019t) and he kissed me.. I can\u2019t describe how it felt, but him imposing himself as some sort of spiritual leader, I hid my.. let\u2019s call it antenna. His conclusion was that I don\u2019t love him and I\u2019m not gay, no you idiot, I was ashamed. Although he told his BF (best friend) that told me and I told his BF the truth but it never got to him apparently.\n\nAfter he left, we kept talking for 2-3 days after that he seeded a fight after witch we stopped talking, for 2-3 days he was my boyfriend although thousands of km away. I was so utterly devastated because of this and the rest of my life that I decided, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m gonna end it. But before I did that I wanted to see his BF, let\u2019s call her Tris, for witch I developed a sympathy in the meantime. Somehow I was idiot enough to tell her I like her although I don\u2019t know to this day if she manipulated me or If i did like her (you\u2019ll see why) so we became a couple that night. Our relationship escalated way too quickly, in 6 months we moved together, finally not living with my father, but, the worse was yet to come. I was just out of my 2nd disc hernia surgery, and was recovering so I couldn\u2019t sit on chairs for long, couldn\u2019t lift things the whole shebang, and got there, her mother is a religious dedicate idiotic and liar piece of shit, her dad was an alcoholic, like my grandfather without coffee table legs. The second I set foot into that yard I wanted to leave. I only knew her mother via a spiritual school I\u2019ve attended at because Andy was doing so. She was a nice person there, but at home, she was straight from hell. This was a turning point in my life, I gained independence from my father although I didn\u2019t really consider it that badly, but I was entering a pit of vipers. 3 days after I moved in hell started and everyone started fighting because of my lack of job and any other idiotic thing you can imagine, one day her mother yelled and cried because I used her kettle to boil some water for a coffee, yes, that kind of idiotic. I was forced to get a job despite my recent surgery. I was still in high school at this point 12th grade, but since the 2nd half of 11th grade I skipped school because of the first (and then the 2nd) surgery. Hell broke in full and everyone was rejecting me, including her, as a result I didn\u2019t want to have sex with her anymore (before moving we would do that often) and she starting fighting with me over that, so she could get anything she wants, so I kissed her, hugged her, had sex with her against my will, I\u2019ve let myself be controlled by her just so she would shut up. I became colder on the inside, with time my gay side revolted, my regret for what happened between me and Andy grew and my level of saturation of what happens at home grew to astronomical levels. But I evolved, oh I did, I\u2019ve never been so strong in my life, so stable on my feet and so fair in my judgment, I learned to not interfere with other people unless absolutely necessary, l learned to not care when it is the best thing to do and many more. There are bad things I got though, I got an addiction for buying stuff, I got even more depressed, this is pretty much the 10th year of depression, I am sadder, I got a bit of an anxiety for the problem suite to be complete also a bank loan that is so expensive I can\u2019t afford to move out anymore (still her mom manipulated both of us until we got the loans to renovate her part of the house) , since I\u2019ve had a huge fight with my dad, it was the first time I told him how much of an asshole he was, I don\u2019t regret it, I\u2019m just mad her mom manipulated me until the break point with yet another irrelevant shit.  \n I wanted to move out from the very beginning but she always said we can\u2019t afford it although we didn\u2019t have any loans or anything up to a point. Many things could\u2019ve been avoided if I would only just put my foot in the ground and said we\u2019ll do it my way. In the 3 years we\u2019ve been together I mostly turned the table in my favor, now, she doesn\u2019t really manipulate me like she was doing in the past, but I don\u2019t feel it's over either. She tries now to offer me love.. but I have up and when I give up, I just give up. I don\u2019t have any trust left in her after all of what happened. She is 7 years older then me, in the last 3 years I had to teach her how to be a human and not a sex animal\u2026 personally I would\u2019ve expected this to be the opposite.\n\nYou may be wondering about my mother, well, she had a few appearances, one in 6-7 years. The only truly relevant one is when I stayed with her one week, I was something like 2nd \u2013 3rd grade back then, and I have eaten only cheap chocolates the entire week because she cooks even more horribly then my dad, she made a lamb soup, and gave me the entire complete lamb head in my plate, his eyes towards me, since then I barely eat meat and I don\u2019t eat any soups since then. After that week I started gaining weight rapidly and I was never able to sustainably loose the weight. I\u2019m now 180cm tall and 120kg heavy\u2026 but I don\u2019t blame only her. When my dad moved back again, somehow they (he and my grannies) discovered some kind of endocrine problem, got me to doctor and stopped the treatment too early because my dad was too lazy to work and my gran didn\u2019t have enough money to buy my medicine. I will never forgive him for that.\n\n Now I can barely sleep at night, I am afraid of becoming homeless, this is a fear my dad gave me, when he told me that I am his biggest mistake, he usually included in the phrase that it\u2019s his house I\u2019m living in. and I mean yeah, when we moved to the big city again I got a room completely separated from the renovated part of the house, didn\u2019t have heating, cooling, internet for a while, TV, the only bathroom was in his side of the house so I often did my quick stuff outside or in the back yard because I didn\u2019t want to see him since he always had something he didn\u2019t like about me or what I was doing, I wasn\u2019t even showering as much as I had to because of him. There were weeks in witch I wouldn\u2019t eat any of his food, and I lived with what money I made myself. He always reproached me that he is cooking for me, his food was 90% of the time so horrible, I would consider It to be made for dogs. Now I barely eat any sort of cooked food, I eat mostly junk food because of this trauma I\u2019ve yet to get out of my head.\n\nAlso, I am inches of breaking completely, I feel sad because I feel sad if it makes any sense, I cannot stand to return home to find her or her family anymore, sometimes I literally cry before opening the gate, money won\u2019t grow in trees in this shit of a country I\u2019m living in; my job is paid 4-5k euros/month in the civilized world, I\u2019m paid 700 euros/month. Yeah. Gotta love politics. I miss Andy, I am sorry for what happened, but he doesn\u2019t want to see me or talk to me again, but it\u2019s fine, he did mistakes too, I did my forgiveness, if he wants to do his, okay, If not, very well then, I just hope he\u2019s happy. To top off my shit, my great grandmother passed away in march 2018, and I still can\u2019t get over it, it hurts way too much, I participated at the funeral, visited her cross every time I visit my grandmother, and I still can\u2019t accept that she is gone.\n\n In my life despair, I fell for a coworker (when you are an east European gay guy, that\u2019s a VERY bad thing to happen), he and the sun on the sky make me smile in this hard time, but the sun is pretty much gone now unfortunately and I don\u2019t see him very often, so, I don\u2019t smile very often. But it\u2019s okay, when I am at work, I know to hide what I feel and how I feel it, well, most of the time. Maybe one day I\u2019ll jump off this building, but I don\u2019t want to traumatize anyone.\n\nYou may be wondering why I care about relationships; I wonder too, but probably because I want to feel accepted and loved since except my grans, no one cared for me, but although it makes me sad still being with Tris to this day, it\u2019s not like my life depends on it.\n\nI wanted to share my story, seems like I\u2019m breaking faster then my psychologist can fix, and I don\u2019t want to take any pills.",

My mother was or is diagnosed with NPD and BPD   Fast forward around 4 when my parents divorced. I moved in with my mom in an apartment with my brothers. I would switch living spots a couple times a month. My mom was a horrible drug addict and alcoholic and I guess never took medication for her disorders. There was a few times she\u2019d leave me home alone at just 4 years old for 12 hours just so she could go get high. I remember one time I was crying so loud the neighbors called the cop and I sat on the porch with one of them until she came home. My mom got into a relationship with her drug dealer, probably just for more drugs. I remember this guy, horrible dude. He used to make me and my brothers, (when I was 4 the one was 8 and the other was 12, our sister was 16), drink alcohol, and one time he even made me smoke a cigarette. I also remember we crashed a funeral service for a veteran that was taking place next to our apartment. There were many memories I have of my brothers loving me, not much of my mom loving me. My siblings always told me she hated me. I was 6 when she decided to leave all of us, told us only for thanksgiving break and she\u2019ll be back, and she left with her drug dealer boyfriend to Colorado. We haven\u2019t seen her since. My brothers, technically my half brothers, went to go live with their dad and my sister was 19 at the time so she moved in with her boyfriend and I moved back in with my dad. My dad would have a new woman at the house nearly every month, sometimes even whole families. I would get attached to all of them and then they would leave, an endless cycle. He would also just allowed me to stay up till whenever, I would always go to sleep at like 3 am then get woken up at 4am to go to be dropped off at my grandparents house so I could catch the bus there for school. After school I would come back to their house so they could watch me. I feel there my life was normal. I only had one set of grandparents growing up, my grandma on my mom\u2019s side was dead and my grandpa on her side is some rich snob who lives in Florida on his yacht who doesn\u2019t want anything to do with our family. On the weekends I\u2019d go hangout with the neighbor kids right next door to my house. They were my brother\u2019s friends so that\u2019s how I knew them. I was like 6 or 7 and they were like 12 and 16. I started getting sexually abused or sexually assaulted ,idk what it was, by both of them. This would go on until maybe I was 10. I never told anyone. I suffered in silence. It was around 8 when one of their cousins, who was my age, was over and I had her touch me. And I touched her. You can call me a monster I know I am, I never told ANYONE that part before. Fast forward to when I\u2019m 10 last time I ever heard from my mom, she called me on my 10th birthday. Fast forward to 13. For a while I always had sexual thoughts but then I discovered masturbation. I was already exposed to porn by the boys who did those things to me, but combined with masturbation I became addicted. I became addicted to sexual sensations. And it was when I was 13 I did something I find today disgusting and yet I still have thoughts about doing it again, even though I know I won\u2019t. I discovered my step mom\u2019s sex toy\u2019s, and I used them on myself. It happened a couple times from 13 to maybe about 14 or 15. And like I said , I\u2019m disgusted I did it yet whenever I walk by my step mom\u2019s and my dad\u2019s room I get the urges again. Obviously would never do it again. I was in 9th grade when I met my first love, and it wasn\u2019t even a relationship. But I was SO attached, in an unhealthy way I think. I would be terrified if I didn\u2019t get a response to a text for only 30 minutes and would feel abandoned only for her to be showering. I still feel this way with everyone, even worse now. It was a talking stage that lasted only a month but I was in love. And it took me a year to get over her after she ended things. So much crying, so much begging her. And having that little simmer of love from a woman, I think this is where my desire for it began. It created this need, or revealed this need, that I need attention and affection, specifically from a woman. And I still have that need, more than ever before. It grows like a cancer. Anyways, it was around March of freshman year, after many months of searching and pleading for another girl to love me, when I got into an actual relationship. And I won\u2019t lie, I was so attached for a while. I think I actually loved her. And she matched my sexual needs. Couples of times she\u2019d come over to my house and we\u2019d do stuff and I liked it. But then one random day, she was on vacation for a while and I was too, and I just completely lost feelings for her. I was getting irritated at her texts. Like I was bored of her, or my mind decided I got everything I could from her. Well then I broke up with her and basically ghosted her. She even told me before we dated that she was in a relationship where she was just used for her body, and she asked if I did that. And I guess this is where I started manipulating and I said of course not and that I really didn\u2019t want to do those sexual things, I of course did. And she was saying how sorry she was. It was around October sophomore year when I met a girl on Snapchat and this is where I started using girls to fulfill my sexual needs and my attention needs. I would pretend to have a relationship with her, have her send me stuff, ghost her, apologize to her, and repeat. This was a cycle that I managed to put on for a whole year when I found out she started dating another guy and it pissed me off. Hell just a week ago I tried guilt tripping her and sent her a long paragraph about how she\u2019s the love of my life. She said she would always love me and told me never to block her number. Which I\u2019m not incase they breakup I guess. It was probably beginning of my junior year, so this year, and up until now when this need for attention and affection from woman grew stronger and my sexual needs grew stronger. I was spam adding people on Snapchat, found some apps where I could meet people. Every person I did the same thing. Pretend to want a relationship, get them to send stuff, and then automatically my brain goes \u201calright we got all we could \u201c and I get bored and ghost. Then I tried for a genuine relationship in September, well I started talking to someone, while i was doing all this by the way, and I really did like her. But it was only recently maybe a week before Christmas when I got just so bored of her. Started getting irritated at the text messages. And again I manipulated her and told her I\u2019m just too hurt for a relationship right now, and she said she\u2019s not either and we\u2019re still talking, she has feelings for me but I don\u2019t have any for her but I think I like the attention. I guess I\u2019m taking her to Starbucks Sunday I don\u2019t even know. I\u2019m still snapping girls and exchanging photos and stuff. I feel cursed. Oh and another thing I forgot to mention, over the years like my 13-15, in order to fuel my attention needs I would bullshit so much online. On discord servers I was someone else, using pictures of my brothers and their friends and saying it was me, on here making fake stories and such. My closest friend says even now I still crave attention so much. Am I just a horrible person? I even lied to my siblings about me being some sociopath killing animals when I was a kid, and I did this only a couple months ago. For once I was completely honest here. Please, if anyone can help me or give advice I\u2019d appreciate it so much. I understand I\u2019m a monster. I think I am a freak.",

    "content": "Just a little vent. I fucking _hate_ how we treat the poor in India. We are taught to ignore, ignore and turn a blind eye to these children who have no future, and ignore some more.\n\nContext: I'm in 12th so I barely go out, yet last night me and a few friends went out for out for a walk. We were in the park at 21h00, and in comes a young boy of probably 4 years of age holding the hand of his brother, 8 or 9 years old. I am very compassionate about children. I honestly am. And I'm also so very touched when I see those who are poor. The little child wore no shoes and his feet were all white due to dust, god knows how long he has been walking barefoot on the roads and the pavement. He wore a tore down shirt, and a pair of shorts (which are barely anything for the October nights which are quite chilly). My friends just ignored it, got distant when we passed them. \n\nI fucking hated it.\n\nI was once in a grocery store and a child came up, holding some biscuit pack to get it billed. It was probably 10 rupees, and the child only had 8. No one fucking volunteered to pay- not even 2 rupees, because HEY, THE POOR SHOULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN, RIGHT? IT'S THEIR PROBLEM. \n\n We are taught to keep hoarding and hoarding and hoarding- being Indians, we never help what we grew up seeing and critisize the poverty so much. We glorify the west and hate on India and the poor. Well you know why the West is ahead? They have the sense of community work. When I was in Paris, the people were sitting down to talk with the poor, the beggars.\n\n Today was aashtami, and kanchaak is a prominent practice where I live (North). My mother was upset that we had to hand out the plates to some girls from nearby encrochments because no \"society children\" were available.\n\nI fucking hate hate hate this.\n\nI remember when I was a child, 8 years old, and our domestic worker was a 16 year old girl. Each morning, she came to our house, polished my shoes while I went to school. Do you fucking see this image? THAT child was laboring while I GO TO SCHOOL.\n\n\n I fucking hate our education system for such an unemphasized role of sensitivity- What the fuck did I do to get educated? Being born in a good house? What use is my education if I go to bed with no worries while children don't have the fucking basic necessities? How do I go to bed while children don't have food in their bellies? How?\n\nI hate the politicians- Are poor just a strategy for you to get votes? Innocent children are starving, they don't have anything, HELP THEM, DO SOMETHING.\n\nI fucking *HATE* our media and celebrities. For fuck's sake, open Delhi Times. Open it. The headline in BIG, BOLD LETTERS is \"WATCH PRIYANKA CHOPRA RECOUNT HOW THEY PLAYED CRICKET AT HER WEDDING\". I fucking hate this ignorant media that somehow makes the lives of these celebrities the prime base, focusing on Kardashians, Bieber, and Shah Rukh Khans and ignoring the real problems.\n\nI also hate the middle class. I see these friends of mine who live in big skyscrapers, go to Europe for vacations, and sit down and critisize India. These are also the people that eat at lavish restaurants and consider anything less than Radisson of poor taste. These are the friends that turn a blind fucking eye to the children begging them for one meal, only one meal. It's hilarious that at one side we have these big residential buildings with golf carts to transport people here and there, while just outside children go to bed without having eaten.\n\nWhile I go to school, I see. I see our country. From the bus I see these parents coddling their children. I see their \"servants'', young boys and girls, barely 14 or 15, in tarnished, blackened clothes, holding the former's school bags. I see children carrying garbage bags from 6 am in the morning. Children sleeping on pathways. And I see people ignore them.\n\nIgnore them\n\nIgnore them\n\nAnd ignore them.\n\nI have an uncle who runs a guest house. One day my cousin's Irish wife visited. She started crying because there were little boys of 10 years working there. We taught her to ignore.\n\nAnd ignore some more.\n\nAnd I fucking hate this.\n\n\nWe refuse to give the poor money saying they don't do any work. It's a country where engineers don't have jobs, we think that these poor children would get one without education? It's a shame we want to hoard so much that we only think of ourselves. We see so many westerners come to India to help these children- while Indian masses just turn blind eye to them. Oh- and we have the money. But we use it to buy iPhones because our last version is now outdated. We use it to buy the Gucci heels that we just can't live without. We use it to live the American Dream in a country that is struggling to stand on its feet.\n\nI asked my parents today that when I leave for uni next year- fund someone's education. Now my mom is a professor in DU and she immediately agreed. My father? He fucking hated the idea. He said that poor have done nothing for us. And this is the ideology so so so many people I have seen having.\n\n\nI just hate this. I hate that we are so self centered we cannot even help our fellow countrymen. We want Nikes in a country where children walk barefoot. We want, we want and we want more without ever thinking of others. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.\n\nI'm sorry if this is a big vent- It was just piled up for a long time. I'm sorry if it is more emotional than factual, I just wanted a place to seek refuge for my thoughts.",

    "content": "**Chatgpt Summary** (since everyone is saying the main post is too long):\n\nSummary of Key Events\n\nThe Camping Trip Invitation\n\nN (26F) invited you (25M) on a last-minute camping trip. She had already packed, and you joined her, bringing your own belongings. Friday night went well as you both spent time listening to music and chatting.\n\nTensions Begin to Build\n\nOn Saturday morning, you both woke up early, following N\u2019s routine, which included yoga. N offered to make breakfast, and you accepted. You went to the bathroom and were delayed for about half an hour. When you returned, N seemed upset, feeling like her time had been disrespected as she had been waiting to go paddle boarding. When you tried to apologize and explain why you were delayed, N responded angrily, telling you to \u201cfuck off.\u201d You felt this was unfair, and in response, you prepared a cannabis vape, which seemed to escalate the tension between you further.\n\nConflict at the Lake\n\nN took her paddle board and hammock and walked to the lake without saying much. You followed, attempting to reconcile and ask to go paddle boarding with her. The water was choppy, and N expressed frustration that it had been calmer earlier. She set up her hammock, which blew in the wind.\nYou left for a brief walk to look at boats, not informing N, and returned about 30 minutes later. When you came back, you found N lying on her paddle board and realized she had fallen and was injured.\n\nN\u2019s Injury and Emergency Response\n\nN explained that she had fallen out of her hammock and injured her neck and head. She expressed anger, believing you had witnessed her fall and ignored her calls for help. You tried to explain that you hadn\u2019t heard anything due to your hearing loss and the distance.\nYou suggested calling an ambulance, but N was worried about the cost and insisted she did not want an ambulance. You tried to convince her but eventually ran to find help from others at the campsite. With their assistance, you called for an ambulance and communicated with emergency services, despite reception issues.\n\nMedical and Emotional Tensions\n\nWhen paramedics arrived, they assessed N and determined she did not have a broken neck but had a concussion. N initially declined to go to the hospital due to concerns about cost, and the paramedics agreed to leave her at the campsite if someone could monitor her for the next 24 hours.\nAfter the paramedics left, N admitted feeling worse than she had told them. You tried to encourage her to go to the hospital, but tensions continued as she questioned your handling of the situation, including why you had left her earlier.\n\nEscalation and Police Involvement\n\nYou and N argued further as she wanted to go paddle boarding despite the choppy water and her concussion. You tried to prevent her from going out, taking her paddle to ensure her safety. This led to more conflict as she expressed suicidal thoughts and frustration.\nLater, N drove off in her car, and after consulting with your parents, you decided to call the police for a wellness check, fearing for her safety while driving with a concussion. The police conducted a check and spoke with her flatmate.\n\nFinal Conflict and Blocking\n\nN returned to the campsite later that night, and you returned her paddle and some of the food you had taken when you were hungry. You spent the night in her tent after the police and paramedics checked in with her again.\n\nAt some point after that while you were asleep, N left the campsite, leaving behind some of her belongings. You attempted to contact her later, confirming that you would leave her tent and other items at her house. The flatmate responded dismissively, and N subsequently blocked you on multiple platforms over the next few days.\n\nSummary Conclusion:\n\nThis series of events involved escalating tensions during a camping trip that culminated in N being injured and feeling unsupported, while you tried to manage the situation as best as you could, balancing your concern for her safety and her autonomy. Despite your efforts to communicate and seek help, things deteriorated, leading to further conflict and N distancing herself through blocking and setting boundaries.\n\n___\n\n**Full Post:**\n\nI [25M] have been seeing this girl N [26F] for a few months. We started soon after I moved to the country.\n\nOn Friday she told me she was going camping an invited me along. Since it was last minute, she had already packed and I just had to grab my stuff and jump on the train to meet her, which I did. Friday was good fun, we were listening to music and chatting about stuff on the drive. She had been asking me to think about cutting down my weed use (I have a prescription for sleep and anxiety) and also keen for me to get up early with her and do activities since I am usually more of a night owl. I agreed to this and used significantly less weed than usual on Friday and went to bed early. I woke up with her around 5:30 that morning and we started the day with yoga, relaxing and chatting. She offered to make breakfast and I happily accepted. I went off to the loo at about 8:15 but was having some difficulties and ended up being in there for about half an hour. When I got back, N had packed up everything and seemed cross. She said she had been waiting for me and had been wanting to go out paddle boarding. I said sorry and explained that it took a while to shit, and said that I understood that she felt like I had disrespected her time. Apparently I didn\u2019t reassure her in the right tone and she told me to fuck off. I said I didn\u2019t feel like I deserved to be told to fuck off and she said it again. I then started making a cannabis vape because I could feel myself getting aggravated. She asked why I was having it and I said because I didn\u2019t give a shit. She said thank you for giving me the closure that I needed. I said sorry, I do give a shit, I just want to calm down.\n\nAfter this, we finished packing the car, she locked it and walked off with her paddle board and hammock looking mad and not saying anything to me. I followed her to the lake with my backpack and was trying to ask if I could go paddle boarding with her. She wasn\u2019t really saying anything and when we got to the lake it was pretty choppy water. She then said she was annoyed because when she had come there earlier it had been more calm. She put up her hammock and it was blowing in the wind quite a bit. In hindsight I probably should have recognised this danger more, but I\u2019ve only been in a hammock a few times whereas it\u2019s something N loves so I assumed she didn\u2019t need or want my advice. It felt like she was pissed about the paddle boarding, and me having a vape, and I didn\u2019t know what to do or say. I had put my bag next to her hammock and it had my phone in it. Note that we live in a generally very safe country and I was getting very poor reception in most places in the campground so I really wasn\u2019t using it or thinking about it at all. I walked down a path to go look at some boats which I did, and then saw another beautiful path which I decided to continue on for a bit. I didn\u2019t say anything before I left which was bad, but also she was literally telling me to fuck off about 10 times that morning. In my head I was getting some space and time to process and walked down the path for about 20 minutes, and then came back. I was feeling much happier and wanting to try just move past stuff and enjoy the weekend.\n\nWhen I got back, N was lying chest down on top of her paddle board. I thought she was just chilling at first, so I sat on the each of the paddle board and tried to talk to her. It became clear pretty much immediately that something was wrong and I went over to her and she said she had fallen out of her hammock and that I had seen it. I was really really concerned because she said she had fallen on her head and neck and also confused and didn\u2019t know what to say about the accusation. I didn\u2019t see or hear anything, I don\u2019t know why or what exactly happened. I walked away while she was looking at getting in the hammock, so I guess it did happen soon after I walked away. I have mild to moderate hearing loss (hearing aids which I wear at work but not usually while camping), we were in fairly thick bush, and there were a bunch of campsites quite close by which hadn\u2019t heard her call out. I also hadn\u2019t gotten her messages asking for help and about half and hour later calling me a sociopath. I tried to say these things, but was mostly just trying to figure out how she was injured and what to do. She had fallen straight on her neck, and I was terrified at the possibility that she had broken her neck. I tried to tell her not to move as much as possible. She said because she had crawled over that her neck wasn\u2019t broken (that she would have stopped moving instantly). I was trying to say that we needed to call an ambulance just to be safe, because I wasn\u2019t a medical expert. My understanding is that it\u2019s possible to break the spinal vertebrate without damaging the nervous system, and that you become paralysed if the unprotected nervous system is damaged (which can happen immediately with the break, but doesn\u2019t always). She was acknowledging that she needed to go to the hospital, but wanted someone to just take her because she was worried about the cost of the ambulance due to her visa (in a country with public healthcare but don\u2019t know exactly how it works with her visa). She said she thought this would cost about $6000 and that was a big chunk of her savings and that she felt like her neck was fine because she had been able to crawl to the board. While the money sucks, everything I\u2019ve ever heard about this situation would be to call an ambulance and tried to say that, but she said she wouldn\u2019t talk to me ever again if I did. I still felt like I should, but said that I would run and get help to get a second opinion.\n\nI ran around the campsite and saw some friendly looking people about our age. I ran over to them and tried to explain as best as I could, and 2 of them (a man and a woman) came with me. The girl went off to find the park ranger and the dude seemed to know first aid and was checking things and understanding what had happened. He asked me to gently touch her heels and see if she could tell which side (she could and put a towel over her so she wouldn\u2019t get sunburnt. I was so happy they were there to help and advise. The dude was saying that because we weren\u2019t experts he also felt like she needed and ambulance, and when the girl and ranger got back they were saying the same. At this point I called the ambulance. Reception was atrocious and they weren\u2019t hearing 90% of the things I was saying, I was rushing around trying to find better reception try communicate exactly what happened, try figure out exactly how to give directions to rural spot, and also try relay instructions to everyone else. The ambulance said they would sent someone immediately and asked if it was easy to find in the campground. I wasn\u2019t really sure and the girl and the ranger said someone should go to the corner to wait, and were encouraging me to go. This was stupid in hindsight (obviously I should have stayed there with N, but I was just trying to get her proper medical help asap at the time). I asked N where her keys were and she said she didn\u2019t want me to drive her car. I said that to the ranger who asked if I was a bad driver. I said I thought I was a good driver. I am a good driver. N has never seen me drive before due to roadside drug testing laws in our country which can detect positive days after you smoke and no exception for medical patients like me. I had had a small vape about 3 hours prior but I also have a high tolerance (didn\u2019t feel much from the vape in the first place) and felt completely sober at that point. I took N\u2019s car said that I was just going to drive to the corner and should be back soon. In hindsight I shouldn\u2019t have left her there. But she was so angry with me I thought she might be happier around other people, felt like I was leaving her with 3 safe and trustworthy people and also the ranger was saying they\u2019d probably be less that 20 minutes away. \n\nI drove down to the road and was waiting there for about 45 minutes freaking out about what to do, if i should stay and wait or go back to see N, and starting to panic about not being there but also worried that if I left then the ambulance wouldn\u2019t know where to go. I was also getting basically no reception at the road so couldn\u2019t call anyone. I eventually decided to try call the ambulance again and reception was so poor we were needing to communicate with button presses (0 for yes 00 for no). I drove back into the campsite, and managed to communicate more and got a better idea of when they were coming. I went back to N and only the ranger was left at that point. I said what the ambulance said. Soon after some other rangers arrived and he sent them to the road this time. I was sitting next to N trying to reassure her and also chat to the ranger.\n\nAfter a bit, the paramedics arrived. They listened to what had happened and talked to N. They checked her neck and determined that it wasn\u2019t broken. They sat her up and gave her some basic pain relief and asked her pain level which she said was 7/10. They said she had a concussion and gave an information sheet of how to handle that. They asked some other questions and said they would take her to the hospital. She didn\u2019t say anything for a bit and I said that I thought she might be worried about the cost because of her visa. They said they didn\u2019t know about that, but would be happy for her to stay there with someone who could look out for her for the next 24 hours and drive her to the hospital if needed, which she agreed to.\n\nAfter they left, she admitted that she was worse that she had told them. She said she felt nauseous (something it said on the information form that she should immediately go to the hospital for). She expressed that she didn\u2019t really feel like doctors could help her and that the only thing that would make her feel better was staying in nature at the campsite. She was angry at me for how I had handled the situation saying that she knew her neck was fine and for leaving to go wait for the ambulance. She then said that the ranger said he had purposefully sent me away because he thought I was frantic. Apparently when I got back he was asking if she felt comfortable with me being there. I was honestly feeling humiliated hearing that he had said that. I felt like I had been doing everything I possibly could for the last 2 hours at that point and she was angry at me for how I handled some difficult spur of the moment decisions.\n\nWe went to her car and next few hours were kind of a blur but I\u2019ll try explain as best as I remember. I know fucked up a lot in this point. I encouraged her to go to the hospital because of the nausea, but she didn\u2019t want to. I was hungry and tried and stressed out from everything at this point and understood she had a concussion and had had a traumatic experience but was find it increasingly hard to deal with her anger and belief that I had watched her fall on her head or cry out for help and then left. I knew we were both hungry and tried to give her a snack and offered to make food but for some reason she took stuff out and started doing it. I offered to take over to make something alongside it but she said she wanted to and it was enough for us both. I didn\u2019t have any other food there and was really hungry at this point.\n\nHere\u2019s the point where I was a huge asshole. At some point while she was making lunch I responded to one of her accusations by saying that I couldn\u2019t believe that she believes that I leave her there hurt and that I felt like she often forgot all the positive things I do and can only focus on negative or perceived things she imagines that I did. She said she didn\u2019t feel like she needed to apologise for saying \u201cfuck you\u201d earlier because she was emotionally disregulated at the time. Also, I just got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago and she about a year ago. I said the fact that she said things to me like I just use her to get off (when she has been the one asking me for sex much more that I have been and I always make sure she cums), she\u2019s the one who refused to delete dating apps off her phone when I realised they were on there recently even after I told her I deleted them a month ago, I\u2019ve told her that really care about her and feel love for her. It hurt me that she even thought I would watch her get hurt and not help her. I know she has trauma in her past which is probably why she thinks that. I said that she couldn\u2019t see all the things I was trying to do to show I cared about her. Lifestyle changes and ways I\u2019ve been giving her my energy and made her my focus. I said it was so obvious that she felt this way that even when I had been doing my absolute best to help her when she was hurt the ranger still picked up on it and sent me away because it\u2019s what he thought she wanted (she didn\u2019t). I said that it sounded like she had had some huge assholes in her life before but I had never had problems like this with anyone and that I was sick of her making me feel like everything was my fault. I said that if everyone she had previously dated had caused her issues that said more about her than me and that I wasn\u2019t a monster that would leave her there hurt.\n\nAfter this she said she wanted me to leave the campsite. I talked to my mum for a bit but reception was terrible and asked her to talk to N. I asked to talk to her sister but she said no. I asked if we could have some food and talk about a plan. That we were both hangry and not thinking straight. She said I couldn\u2019t have any more of her food and that she wanted me to leave. I didn\u2019t have anything with me except some clothes and a phone with low battery and a water bottle. I tried to ask her plan and how she could be safe, and point out that the paramedics had said she needed to be checked on the next 24 hours. She said that I was harrasing her and yelled at me to go away or she would call the police. At that point I said okay, and just asked if I could take some food since I was really hungry and didn\u2019t have any and she gave me a banana. I said goodbye and that I hoped she would be okay and walked to the main gate.\n\nI realised that my phone was super low battery and not charging and my battery bank was empty and was trying to get an Uber or something. And it died. So I felt like I had no choice but to go back. She asked me to prove that my phone was dead so I did. She let me plug it in to her car for a but. I was not talking to her and sitting away from her (in the car with the phone). I saw her grabbing her paddle board and going down to the lake. I reluctantly followed her but was worried about her going out with a concussion. I asked her and said I was worried. She didn\u2019t have a life jacket. She had a concussion and didn\u2019t look or sound herself. The water was still choppy. I\u2019m not the strongest swimmer and it\u2019s a big lake, if something had happened and she had fallen in I almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop her from drowning.\n\nI tried to point these things out and she said I was catastrophising. I acknowledged that I might be, I wasn\u2019t a concussion or paddle boarding expert. I said if she could call any one friend she trusted and they said it was a good idea, I would let her go out. She tried calling her ex (now friend), but he didn\u2019t pick up. She didn\u2019t want to call her sisters or another friend. I felt like if I let her go out I would be letting her and her loved ones down. She said didn\u2019t care if she went out and died. That I was making her feel that she wanted to die. That made me feel like I really couldn\u2019t let her go out and I took her paddle. She threatened to go out without a paddle and started yelling loudly at me. I could see a nearby woman was concerned and encouraged her to check on N and said that she had gotten a head injury earlier and I was discourage her from paddle boarding. I walked away to give them space to talk looked like the lady went to N and they talked a little then she walked away.\n\nI went back there and sat next to her paddle and didn\u2019t say anything. She seemed to understand that I couldn\u2019t let her go out. And walked away. I followed her back to the car. I was trying to say that I was really worried about her being safe now especially after saying she didn\u2019t care if she died. That I felt like I couldn\u2019t leave the campsite since the paramedics had asked me to keep an eye on her and her behaviour didn\u2019t seem normal at all. I said that I felt like I needed to stay and recored the conversation when I did and brought up the paddle boarding stuff and the fact that she said she thought that she was going to die. I recorded her saying that she would call the police and tell them I stole her paddle board and me saying that I hadn\u2019t that I of course was going to give it back but it didn\u2019t seem safe in that moment. I felt like I needed to protect myself legally if she did do that but also felt like it would be irresponsible to leave her there without even telling anyone.\n\nI hadn\u2019t eaten anything in 8 hours at this point and she was still refusing to share food so I said that I was going to give her space, but that I was going to eat some of the food. I took the pot and she tried to grab it back but I moved away. I went and sat and say her go down to her paddle board and pack it up. I didn\u2019t know what she was doing but I was talking to my parents asking for advice. Then I saw her drive away. As far as I knew this is unsafe. The paramedics had indicated that I should take her to the hospital if she needed to. I hadn\u2019t researched it but have since and it seems to agree that it\u2019s very unsafe. My parents were strongly encouraging me to call the police which I obviously didn\u2019t want to do. But they were saying with the fact that she said she doesn\u2019t care if she died, the fact that she had this concussion, the fact that none of us were experts and what happened if something did happen.\n\nI listened to their advice and the police said they would just do a wellness check on her and that she wouldn\u2019t be in trouble and they would call an ambulance if she needed it. They asked the campsite we had been staying at and her home address. I messaged her before I called them saying that I felt like I needed to and was worried about her and other people on the road (she saw this message and didn\u2019t respond) and then after I called reassuring her that she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. That I loved her and was just worried about her.\n\nAfter that, I realised I needed to try look out for myself. It was dark, I didn\u2019t have shelter or much water, phone almost dead. I had the food I had taken (I was always only going to have some of it and said so when I took it). I tried getting an uber or taxi but was in the middle of nowhere an no one wanted the job and reception was still making things really difficult. At some point a few hours later I saw N turn back into the campsite and drive past me. Not sure if she saw me. She messaged asking what I had done with the things I had stolen (meaning the paddle and pot of food). I said they were down at the road with me, she could get the now or I could leave the with police. She didn\u2019t respond. About half an hour later I realised that my phone was going to die and I wasn\u2019t getting out that night and messaged her saying that I was on 4% battery and that I couldn\u2019t get out of the campground and to please let me know if she was there and that I was going to be by the lake for a bit and then lock myself in the bathroom for the night. She replied that I could have her tent if I didn\u2019t say a word to her. I asked if I could also charge my phone please. This was on instagram. She sent me other messages on whatsapp that I didn\u2019t see until the next day, sharing her location and saying that I could have her tent but that if I harassed her she would call the police and let the whole campsite know. I didn\u2019t see those messages then. I went down to the lake and my phone died, and I wandered around the campsite until I found her sitting next to her car. I gave her her paddle and put the food on the picnic blanket. She packed up her stuff and gave me her tent. She had her air mattress set up in her car (she often sleeps like this). I said thank you and asked if I could also charge my phone please. I felt completely helpless (didn\u2019t even have a torch to setup the tent) without it and i was just done at that point. She said no. I said please please and she told me to fuck off and go ask someone else. Then her phone was ringing and she asked why her flatmate was calling. I realised the police must have gone round there and said they had asked for her address and reminded her of the wellness check.\n\nI went and asked someone and was able to get some charge and luckily their battery bank also had a torch so could setup the tent. At this point I ate half the food in the pot and knocked on the window to show half the food was still there, and put it on the roof of the car. I then pulled the picnic blanket into the tent, wrapped myself up and was getting ready to sleep.\n\nI heard a car outside and footsteps and thought it was the ranger, but then heard talking and N say my name and then someone say \u201c[my name]!\u201d. I said hello and opened the the tent to two cops. I came out of the tent and they asked why they were there. I said earlier N fell out of the hammock and got a concussion, not really knowing where to begin and feeling horrible at this point. They said they don\u2019t care about earlier, why are they here now? I tried to explain why I called them, about the argument and the paddle boarding thing and driving away and that I was just worried for N\u2019s safety and unsure of the right thing to do and was really sorry if I had wasted their time. They asked if there had been any physical altercation and I said no. They asked if I was worried for my safety and I said no. They told me to standby and went and talked to N. They talked to her for a while and an ambulance came to check on her. I had not asked for an ambulance to be called. I sat there with my hands in front of me, unsure of what was about to happen. It felt pretty awful feeling everyone\u2019s eyes on me in the campground. After a bit, one of the cop\u2019s came back, said there wasn\u2019t an issue, that I should sleep it off, talk to N in the morning, might have to part ways. I thanked him and climbed back into the tent not even looking at N. The paramedics and cops left and I was almost passing out at this point. I heard N\u2019s alarm go off a few times and remember covering my ears and heard her walking around at some points but I don\u2019t remember falling asleep.\n\nI woke up just before 6 and when I went outside her car wasn\u2019t there. She had left behind the pot of food (untouched) and her rubbish bag. I messaged her \"I\u2019m going to leave the campsite soon. I will leave you tent here next to your pot and rubbish. Hope you\u2019re safe. Please understand that I called the police yesterday because I was worried about your safety\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if she thinks that I called the police or the second ambulance to the campsite in the evening and that\u2019s why I was really keen to charge my phone. And then asked about half an hour later if she was safe as I was getting increasingly worried about her driving after the police visit last night with a concussion in the middle of the night. I tried calling her at 7 and she saw my message and then blocked me on everything. I was just happy to know that she was okay.\n\nHer flatmate had messaged me \u201chello\u201d around the time of the police visit, when they were calling from her house (round 10pm). \n\nI replied the next morning \"Hey S, so sorry about everything. N fell out of her hammock yesterday and got a concussion, I thought she was acting unusually after that but she didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital. She said some things that seemed to indicate she didn\u2019t seem to have much regard for her well-being and she drove away and I was worried her safety driving concussed so I called the police for a wellness check and they asked for her address. They said she wouldn\u2019t be in trouble and just checking on her wellness and call an ambulance if she needed it. I messaged her to tell her this. I\u2019m not sure what changed but she came back to the camp site a few hours later and was going to sleep in her car and I slept in her tent. The police and ambulance both came to check at the campsite last night. When I woke up she wasn\u2019t here, so hopefully she got in last night or will in a few hours. I haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with her. I\u2019m so sorry for the difficulties I\u2019ve caused you and your flat.\u201d\n\nHe responded \u201cOk. Better not see you around here pal\u201d\n\nI said \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I still have her tent which I was going to put on the other side of your fence, but can leave it somewhere else if you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t. You won\u2019t see me again and I won\u2019t contact N. I\u2019m sorry if the police visit caused any problems or ruined your weekend and for everything else.\u201d\n\nHe responded \u201cWell see about the tent champ\u201d, and I liked that message.\n\nHaven\u2019t heard anything since (that was 2.5 days ago).\n\nI managed to hitchhike back to town. I managed to lose one of the tent poles and had to leave the picnic blanket as it was to bulky to hitch hike with on the way back but have ordered a replacement pole and blanket of the same brand. I probably won\u2019t replace the pot, I feel like I gave that back to her and don\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t take it with her.\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s what happened from my perspective. I\u2019ve tried to be as honest and detailed as I could. Feeling pretty terrible about it and was holding out to seeing my therapist today, but woke up sniffly and coughing so I had to cancel. Really not sure how to deal with this or process this. I feel like I would change a lot of things I did in hindsight but also was doing my best with a difficult situation and was trying my best to look out for N to the best of my abilities. Am I a huge asshole? Be straight with me. I still love her. My brother got a concussion earlier this year and his personality was quite different for a month afterwards.",

    "content": "My mother left my father in 1968, when I was only a few days old. The final straw was when he came home one night especially drunk. My father, was a full-blown alcoholic by this point, but this night was different; he became physical. My father took me from my mother and forcefully threw her out of the house.\n\nShe was 2 weeks out of the hospital from my birth and still had stitches in her stomach. My father and I were locked inside alone, and all my mother could do was watch us through the windows. He stumbled about the house with me in his arms, eventually passing out. My mother was able to get back into the house. She grabbed me, and a couple changes of clothing and left my father. My parents were divorced shortly after, and I\u2019d only see my father a few times in the next 8 years.\n\nIn 1976 when I was 8 years old, my dad wrote me a letter. He wanted to re-connect with me. He was living in Arizona where he owned an insurance company. Not long after receiving his letter, my dad let me know he was driving to Albuquerque to see me. I\u2019ll never forget the day. I stood out at the corner down the street from our house at the southwest corner of Los Alamos and Laguna, so I could see him coming.\n\nHe was supposed to arrive at 2:00 pm. I remember vividly looking into every car that passed by for my dad. At 8:00 pm, well after dark, my grandmother \u201cBama\u201d walked down the street, put her arm around me, and held me tight as she walked me home; not a word was said.\n\nI fell asleep that night crying with my pillow over my head, so nobody could hear me. I still can\u2019t forget the feeling of being worthless, my own father had forgotten about me. He never did show that spring, and I didn\u2019t see him for a very along time after that.\n\nMy dad\u2019s life was intense. He was born to William and Mary. William\u2019s father, my great-grandfather, was partners with and a cousin of Conrad Hilton, of Hilton Hotels. He was partners with Conrad in the startup of the Hilton Hotel chain.\n\nMy grandfather William was killed in a mugging in El Paso, Texas when my father was a child. As a result of my grandfathers\u2019 murder, which went unsolved, my father inherited my grandfathers\u2019 hotel fortune at an early age. My father enjoyed his inherited money and lived the life of a jet setter. However, this fortune was probably one of the worst things that could have happened to him.\n\nHe was drawn to Hollywood, where he produced music and television. None of it was very successful, other than one song that made the charts. In all reality, my dad was just another young, good looking rich kid, who eventually was chewed up and spit out by Tinseltown. He wasn\u2019t cut out for swimming with the sharks. He left for Arizona to rebuild his life.\n\nI eventually reconnected with my father after he\u2019d move to Colorado and began going to spend time with him twice a year. This was absolutely an amazing time for me. My life in New Mexico was wonderful, but also chaotic and confusing; I had bounced from home to home, until I settled at my grandparents.\n\nBut twice a year, I was with my \u201cdad\u201d, he was great and we had a ton of fun; he could do no wrong in my eyes. I was never with him long enough to see his character defects, his human side. I just saw the man who was always excited to see me, was new and exhilarating, and lived a life that I desperately wanted to be a part of.\n\nWhen I was thirteen, my grandparents let me know that my dad was moving back to New Mexico. They told me that he\u2019d checked himself into a treatment center and when he got out, he\u2019d permanently live in Albuquerque. I was ecstatic. I spent the next month fantasizing about how good my life was going to be with my dad home. My dad lived up to absolutely every expectation I had for him. His first-year home was an amazing, and to this day, it was the best 12 months of my life.\n\nMy father had remarried for the 4^(th)\u00a0time, and his new wife \u201cPJ\u201d, was an extremely cool and beautiful woman. We had so much fun together. She had a great sense of humor, which made her a perfect stepmother for me.\n\nMy dad was working part time at a law firm, and part time as a disk jockey at a local FM country radio station. I used to love to go down to the station with my dad and just watch him work. He had a wonderful deep voice and always said cool stuff. One night, I went down to the station with my stepmother to hang out with dad. He was pretty busy on air, so PJ and I started exploring the radio station.\n\nWe found another broadcast booth and started pretending to be disk jockeys. We were singing into the microphone and saying the silliest things. PJ really got into it and was acting like a complete clown. Partway through her silly skit, I decided to play a joke on her. I gave her an incredibly shocked look. She stopped her routine and asked what was wrong. I mouthed, \u201cthe microphone is on, you\u2019re broadcasting, over my dad!\u201d Well PJ absolutely fell for it and freaked out.\n\nPJ went tearing down the hallway to my father\u2019s broadcast booth. He was on the air, live as PJ slid into the room. She was mouthing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d over and over. My dad, headsets on, cigarette in his hand, microphone to his lips, talking to 100,000 people over the airways, gave PJ the funniest look I\u2019d ever seen. I was behind PJ in the hallway bent over laughing, snot coming out of my nose. My dad shifted his confused look from PJ to me. The look on his face went from confusion to a wonderful grin and obvious understanding of the situation.\n\nDad signed off by saying \u201cThis is Nick B at KRST; I\u2019ll see you all tomorrow night.\u201d He flipped the switch in the microphone, spun around in his seat and started to laugh. A deep beautiful laugh.\n\nPJ was still trying to explain that she\u2019d drowned out his broadcast with the silly skit in the next room. She was convinced that she\u2019d been talking and singing to all the listeners out there in Albuquerque, and she was mortified. My dad of course knew this wasn\u2019t true, and that I\u2019d played one hell of a trick on PJ. His laugh went from his chest to his belly, a deep cheerful laugh. PJ was a great sport about my joke, but I did have to watch my back for weeks after. She never did get me back.\n\nAlthough my father and PJ were not drinking anymore, they smoked lots of marijuana. My great grandmother who we called \u201cGranny\u201d, was the president of the New Mexico African Violet Society. She had a huge green room at my her house that was filled with flowers. Granny would help my dad grow his pot. The two of them would start the plants in her greenhouse under the grow lights. Then, they\u2019d transplant the marijuana into the back yard amongst the various garden bushes and trees. I was fourteen, it was 1982 and I loved to swipe off my dad\u2019s pot plants and get stoned. I\u2019m sure he knew but never said anything.\n\nBy the fall of 1982, I was starting my freshman year in high school and my dad\u2019s new wife was pregnant. It was a happy time. For the first time in my life, I felt completely secure. It was also time for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. This event draws up to 500 + hot air balloons; it\u2019s amazing. Since PJ was new to Albuquerque, and had never seen it, my dad decided we needed to take her the next morning.\n\nThat evening, I got a call from a really cute girl I\u2019d met at the beach in La Jolla, California earlier in the summer. Her name was Erin, she had blonde hair, and I had a huge crush on her. Erin was in Albuquerque for a couple of days and wanted to go to a movie with me the next day. Of course, there was no way that I was going to the balloon fiesta now! I was an Albuquerque native and had already seen it. But a blond cute girl asking me out on a date, well that just doesn\u2019t happen every day, and my hormones weren\u2019t going allow me to pass up this opportunity!\n\nAs my dad and PJ got ready to go home for the night, I told them that I couldn\u2019t go to the fiesta the next day. My dad told me that was fine and they\u2019d decided to go up to the top of the mountains to watch it from there. The Sandia Mountains tower over Albuquerque. There is a spot at the top where you can look down at the entire city. I was surprised that my father wanted to take PJ up there, for her first Balloon Fiesta experience. It was a long drive and would be nothing like being at the launch site.\n\nI spent a long time trying to convince my dad to not go to the mountains. I told him that PJ would have a much better time, walking through the balloons as they inflated and launched. It is a breathtaking event to be a part of. I persisted until my dad finally relented and promised to take PJ to the fiesta instead of the mountains.\n\nThe next morning, I awoke early; I was excited to go on my date. Granny and I where the only ones in the house. Both my grandparents and parents had decided to go to the balloon fiesta. Granny and I were talking about my date with the cute blond from the beach, while we ate breakfast. She wanted to know all about the girl and what we were going to do. Of course, as my words told her about going to a movie, but my hormones were imagining kissing!\n\nThe television was on; live scenes of the balloon fiesta were coming in over the airwaves. As we were talking, a \u201cbreaking news\u201d broadcast came blaring out of the television. The reporter announced that there had been a balloon crash, and the following scenes were not suitable for children.\n\nThe screen jumped to a very large balloon whose\u2019 gondola was filled with passengers. As the balloon did a hard landing, we could see somebody jump, out as if something was wrong. Flames appeared and the balloon shot back into the air. Several more people jumped out, the quick drop in weight caused the balloon to ascend rapidly. By this point, both the gondola and balloon were on fire.\n\nAs the balloon reached a substantial altitude, there were a series of explosions, and a lot of fire rolling in every direction. I sat there with Granny, our attention fixated on what we were watching. Another large explosion, followed by two people falling from the balloon. These people were holding onto each other as they fell to their death. Smoke following their bodies as they plummeted to the earth. The impact was brutal, and there was no doubt that they could not have survived that fall.\n\nIt was a terrible scene; we\u2019d just watched 2 people fall to a gruesome death, and there was no doubt that other passengers had died as well. People were scurrying all over the place trying to help. The camera would occasionally focus back in on the balloon, which was engulfed in flames and disappearing over the horizon. Until my dying day, I\u2019ll never forget Granny, without taking her eyes off the TV screen saying, \u201cI sure do feel sorry for the families of those people.\u201d\n\nA short time later, a neighborhood friend came over to hang out with me. We went out into the back yard, talked about the balloon wreck that he\u2019d also watched on TV, and started throwing the football. Partway through passing the ball, my friend glanced into the house. From the back yard, you could see the street in front of the house, through a large window. His jaw dropped wide open, he turned back to me and said, that a police are here. I froze; I knew that they were there because of my dad\u2019s marijuana plants. Before I could say a word, my friend ran and jumped over the back wall. I ran through the house and got to the front door, just as the policeman knocked.\n\nWhen I opened the door, there was a policeman in a suit and two uniformed officers. I thought I could see my father and PJ standing out in the street, their backs to me. The police came in and to my surprise, didn\u2019t say a thing about the pot plants. They told Granny and me that there had been a terrible wreck involving Mr. and Mrs. B. The policeman didn\u2019t say that they were dead; he just said, \u201cterrible wreck.\u201d Granny, being the wise old soul she was, looked the officer in the eye and said, \u201care they dead.\u201d There was a long pause while the policeman stared at me. He then looked back to Granny and whispered \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nGranny sat there with her hands over her face, crying. The policeman gently rubbed her back and tried his best to comfort her. I was still standing there stunned, my grandparents had been killed. I\u2019d never experienced anything like this before. I had no way to process what had just happened. I stood there frozen, trying to make sense of it all. How did it happen, where was the car wreck, why did it happen?\n\nAfter a few moments, I looked outside towards where I thought my dad and PJ were. I needed my dad right now; I needed to hold him. I ran past the police officer and out the front door towards them. Just as I ran out the front door, another car pulled up into the driveway. As I ran, I looked over to see my grandparents pulling up. They were alive. I stopped cold in my tracks. I could see the wide-eyed look on their faces, as they took in the scene taking place in the front yard of their house.\n\nI was shocked, I\u2019d just been told that they were in a wreck and were dead. I was trying to comprehend what was happening, did the police have the wrong family?\n\nI turned my head back towards my dad and PJ. They were no longer looking away from the house, they were looking towards me, and they were not my dad and PJ, they were two more police officers dressed in civilian clothes.\n\nIn an instant, my world came crashing down around me. Everything went into slow motion. I couldn\u2019t stand; my legs didn\u2019t work. I fell to the ground. I watched the young police officer run across the yard to intercept my grandparents. I could see my grandmother\u2019s face grimaced with agony as she was told that her oldest son was dead, the officer had to help her sit down; she too couldn\u2019t stand. Then my grandfather, the toughest man I\u2019d known in my life, started sobbing like a child. His upper body draped over the hood of the car, hands over his head, moaning. It was an absolutely horrible scene.\n\nI clearly understood now that there was no car wreck, this had nothing to do with a car. My dad and PJ, were the two people we\u2019d watched being blown out of the balloon, falling to their death, together. I\u2019d just watched my father pregnant stepmother die a horrible death. I\u2019d watched the whole thing, not knowing it was two people who I dearly loved. Granny had said that she felt sorry for the family of those people, and it turned out that we were those people.\n\nI went into a deep shock, that lasted for a long time. To make matters worse, I got a little lost in the confusion. My father was so popular and loved, not only in the family, but in the community. People were flooding to the house, and everybody was beside themselves with grief. I can remember sitting in the corner, no able to move, not able to cry, not able to do anything, but sit there, stunned.\n\nAt one point, my aunt Beth noticed me sitting by myself in the corner. She walked up to me, rubbed my head, and said that she had just the thing to make me feel better. She handed me a joint. This was such a common solution to problems with my family, inebriation.\n\nDuring this ordeal, the person who really touched my heart, and allowed me to grieve in the days following their deaths, was my uncle Dar. I was sitting in my father\u2019s van. It had just been towed back from the Balloon Fiesta parking lot. I\u2019d been sitting there for a couple hours. It smelled like my dad and PJ, so there was nowhere else on the face of this earth that I wanted to be.\n\nDar came out to check on me. He opened the door and asked me if there was anything I wanted. I said, \u201cI just want them back.\u201d Dar grabbed onto me, and we both started crying. It was really the first time I\u2019d broken down since their death. I\u2019ll always be grateful to my uncle Dar for that moment. I believe in my heart it\u2019s what I needed to survive.\n\nThe next few weeks were a nightmare. All the television stations kept replaying the scene; we didn\u2019t dare turn on the TV. People were coming and going, and there seemed no time to decompress and grieve. Then I watched as people started to come and take my father\u2019s things, right in front of me. I don\u2019t think the thought even crossed their minds, that my father\u2019s and PJ\u2019s belongings should go to their children. It was awful.\n\nTheir personal belongings were being carted off, as if we were having a free yard sale. People who had little to do with my father, helped themselves to his belongings. As I write this today, I still have a tough time keeping my resentment in check for these individuals. I wish I still had every item of my fathers. The few that remained, my brother and I have cherished, as if they were the Hope Diamond; they\u2019re irreplaceable to us. I\u2019ve often wondered if anything was given to PJ\u2019s daughter. I\u2019ve been reconnected to her for a few years now, but never had the courage to ask.\n\nDuring the period that the looting of my father\u2019s belongings took place, and the constant stream of people flowing through the house, I found the perfect coping mechanism: alcohol. My grandparents\u2019 house always had booze here and there, but now it was overflowing. People were bringing liquor by the gallons, and nobody was paying close attention to me.\n\nI would grab my usual cup of 7-UP, add wine to it, put the headsets over my ears to drown out the sounds, and play the Dan Fogelberg greatest hits 8 track. This would take me away from it all, it did the trick. This was the beginning of a long and brutal battle with alcohol and drug addiction for me, but I\u2019ll save that story for another time.\n\nIt came time for my father\u2019s funeral, and this too was a terrible experience. There were so many people, and I only knew a few of them. I can remember during the service, I was up near the casket, I looked into the audience, and there were two girls I went to school with: Kerry and Tanya. I was so grateful to see their faces, two friendly faces that I knew, and liked very much. I\u2019ve been forever grateful for their presence.\n\nWhen they put my father\u2019s body in the ground, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. I\u2019d just been with him at the radio station having fun. He\u2019d just let me drive on the road without my license! We\u2019d just sat in his cool green van and listened to music with PJ. This couldn\u2019t be happening. I couldn\u2019t go back to my old life! He couldn\u2019t leave! And that\u2019s when it hit me; I\u2019d talked my father into going to the balloon fiesta instead of the mountains.\n\nThe realization that I\u2019d killed them spread throughout my body. All these people watching his body being lowered into the ground, mourning this tragic loss, and it was because of me. I couldn\u2019t look anybody in the eye. I just stood there staring at my father\u2019s casket. I desperately wanted to touch his coffin and say goodbye, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to move. To this day I still regret not walking over and touching his coffin.\n\nThe level of guilt that I carried for the next twenty years was absolutely brutal. No fourteen- year-old should ever have to shoulder this kind of responsibility. It warped my life in the most incomprehensible ways. I feel incredibly fortunate to have survived.",

    "content": "It's 230 am and the EMS team just picked my mom up off the floor with a tarp. THE EMS TEAM JUST PICKED MY MOM UP OFF THE FLOOR. I'm fucking scared and full of adrenaline and I don't know what happened and I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know where my mom is going. And then the EMS guy who's easily 20 years younger than me is standing there telling me that shes going to this hospital and am I riding with her? I'll meet her up there, im the only one here. I have to be responsible. Don't be scared if the lights are on, it means that they are having a hard time getting an iv going.\n\n Jokes on you bucko, Im already scared.\n\nI watch them drive away and I'm shaking and sobbing but I've got to be strong because I'm the one who's here. I let the dogs inside, I feed them and water them a full 6 hours early. Remember to put on a bra and underwear but not fucking socks. I pack a bag of clothes for my mom? Fucking why did I do that shes not coming home anytime soon. I gather all her meds for the Dr's to know what shes on. Drivers license. Health insurance card. Her cell phone. 6 bottles of water in case there's a goddamn drought in springtime michigan. \n\nIm on my way to the hospital and I call my dad. Do i think he needs to come up? I don't know yet, the ems guys seemed to think it mightve been her blood sugar. Ill let you know. Text my brother. Ask him to call me. And then I'm just waiting. By myself with my wildly frail and sick mom. Who's normally so fucking much that you'd swear shes a foot taller than she really is. But shes just rocking back and forth in discomfort and shed be crying if there was any moisture in her body. She'd be talking if she had any more energy to spare. But everything in her is trying to find that one comfortable spot that'll definitely make everything better, but she never finds it. \n\nIts 4am and the er dr has ordered scans to see if she hit her head when she fell, because we don't actually know how or when she ended up on the floor. Im left in this weird curtained room thats not a room sitting on a folding chair to just wait I guess. They may have told me but I'm struggling to process words and sentences because 6 people carried my mom out of my house on a tarp with handles and I don't know how it got to this point because 5 minutes or an hour or 6 years ago I just had to go pee and my mom was on the floor by her bed. \n\nA whirlwind of activity in the bay behind me brings me back to awareness and its awkward because I don't want to be rude and listen to this poor person's worst and maybe last moments while the medical team fights to bring them back to life. But I don't want to leave before my mom comes back from her scan and I don't want to be rude and the anxiety wins out so I go to wash my face and pray I don't see anything private or be disrespectful accidentally. Im on my way back when the tallest guy I've ever seen is looking at me with pity and sadness and tells me that my mom is currently coding and they're doing all they can but my mom is dying while they try desperately to restart her heart. And it was her behind me having her worst moment. And it was her behind me when i heard them forcing air into her lungs to the beat of staying alive. And it was her behind me when I overheard them charging the aed. And it was her behind me when they shouted clear. And this tall dr apologizes to me and asks if I want to be there when they're trying to stabilize her, but i can't watch my mom die. I just listened to her dying and I didn't even know. I didnt even know because i couldnt look so i didnt see. So I just stand in the hallway ugly crying into my sleeves trying to figure out how I'm going to function without my mom. I can't do this. Im not ready. And do I want a chair? I don't fucking know what i want beyond not being here in this moment with my mom being intubated while dr sad eyes looks down at me asking if there's anyone I can call.\n\nOf course there's people i can call. My dad in Florida. I know he can make it in 17 hours if he speeds. My brother in Ohio, a solid 4 hour drive away. My uncle who is 8 minutes away. Somehow i have to tell these people, her people, my people that our person is potentially not going to make it. I have to tell my baby brother that his mom died on a table and the drs, nurses, miracle workers brought her back but she could slip away at any time so please get here. \n\nI make my calls trying to squeeze the words out of my grief, push the words through my sobs. Please come. Im alone. Mom's dying and I'm alone. Dr sad eyes finds me again and tells me I'm doing a good job, that I did all the right things, that its so hard to do this alone. Please let him know if i need anything. He says that they have her back and that the next 24 to 48 hours are the key to her staying. My tears are falling out of my eyes and someone hands me a whole box of sandpaper tissue. I have to compartmentalize because I've got to be strong for her. Ive got to be strong for my dad. My brother. My son. There's no time to break down now. I've got to field the phone calls of relatives too far away to rescue us. I have to go through my mental checklist of Shit That Needs To Be Handled. I have to be ready to help make her decisions for her because shes not able to do it.\n\nMy uncle appears by my side and somehow in our grief and fear he's a solid presence i can depend on. A rock. He holds our pieces together while we wait for them to clean my mom up to move her to the ICU. He asks dr sad eyes the right questions that I can't verbalize and let's me step away to reorganize my life into little mental boxes so that I can keep going. \n\nWe tell stories and we make jokes in the er waiting area. We struggle through distracting each other from the horror that has happened is happening will happen behind the doors. It's between our moments of false strength when we can't pretend reality is different than the one im living that I sink beneath into my thoughts, replaying the moments that led up to this one. \n\nComing up the stairs to see my mom on the floor, trying to get her to sit up, please mom sit up, talk to me, how did you get here. Mom if this is real I have to call an ambulance. Momma! Please dont let this be real.\n\nThis is emergency services what is the address of your emergency? What's the nature of your call? Is your mom bleeding breathing moving? Please unlock your front door secure your pets turn on your porch lights. \n\nHi Elizabeth? My name is Angie, I'm the nurse who is trying to help you. Please keep your arm as straight as you can sweetheart, you're pulling on your iv.\n\nI DONT HAVE A PULSE...PREP FOR DEFIB...CLEAR...CLEAR...CLEAR! WE HAVE RHYTHM!  ELIZABETH HONEY, STAY WITH US.\n\nA new dr or the same dr comes out to the waiting room to lead us to the icu. Where we wait. And wait. And there's my brother. My mom's baby. And I'm trying to hold it together in sight of his red watery eyes. His grief is my grief but we aren't a family who cries together so we both save our tears for moments alone. Im telling him the series of events but censoring out the parts where I listened to my mom dying because I can't share that particular nightmare yet. And we wait for news. \n\nMinor stroke. Ketoacidosis. Blood sugar at 23. Multiple organ failure. Ventilator. Feeding tube. Central line. \n\nAnd suddenly, its six days later. \n13 days ago my mom took my son and I to a steak house for dinner. She had steak kabobs, well done, extra onions. It was her birthday and I paid the check before she could.\n12 days ago my mom cooked for ten people and threw a birthday party for herself and my son. \n11 days ago my mom went to a pet expo with my future sister in law and fell in love with a dog I'll never meet. We had her favorite chinese food for dinner. \n10 days ago my mom went to an oncologist appointment and all of her labs came back normal and within range. \n9 days ago she had dinner with her friends and she went to her diabetes doctors appointment. \n8 days ago she met up with some friends coworkers colleagues but left early because she wasn't feeling well. \n7 days ago her stomache was bothering her so she canceled her hair appointment and stayed home to sleep it off.\n6 days ago I asked my mom if she was ok and if there was anything I could get for her and she told me she was tired and just wanted to sleep.\n5 days ago 6 people carried my mom out of our house on a tarp with handles.\n5 days ago I listened to my mom code.\n5 days ago I heard my mom say her last words. Thank you. Im sorry.\n\nNurse \"dont be ashamed to cry honey\" and nurse \"I can't read the CT scan you'll have to speak with the doctor\" talk to my mom as they provide her with care. They say her name and explain the things they are going to do to her before they touch her. She doesn't react when they touch her move her take her blood. I know part of what makes her Her is still in there because her blood pressure goes up when I talk to her. Which is kind of funny in a depressing sort of way. \n\nJust in case, I shop for funeral clothes online for my son and myself. I wear black everyday, but nothing i own is good enough to pay my mom the repect that she deserves. I pay all of my bills early so I won't forget anything. I schedule a lawn service for the next two weeks. I cancel that lawn service because I remember that my mom didn't like how he mowed the lawn. I fill my house with groceries. I call these tasks admin duties in my head because if I had someone else to do them for me, I would. \n\nI come to her room everyday and I pray and hope for some sign of improvement, but shes not getting better. She keeps failing the ventilator wean. Her left side is flacid and unmoving. She can open her eyes but she does it less and less as the days bleed away from us. The drs refer the palliative care director to get in contact with us. So again, i rally the troops. My brother drives back in and my uncle leaves work early. We put my dad on speakerphone. \n\nAnd we have to decide. We have to make an impossible decision that really doesn't feel like a decision at all. Do we keep fighting and maybe win a battle that she wouldn't want to win? Or do we make sure that shes comfortable and with as much dignity as she can be afforded follow the most natural process of living, which is to die.\n\nThe neuro doctor shows us moms ct scans and the progression of her stroke. The bleeding and swelling is too devastating for her body to overcome. There's not a decision at all. My mom has no future worth experiencing. We have no hope to cling to that who my mom is as a person as our person would be there or will survive. She would be furious if we forced her to live a life where she can't feed herself, clean herself, speak for herself. So we won't. With no guilt, my dad, my brother, my uncle, and I make the call to provide ease into her next transition. \n\nWe divide up the important phone calls that have to be made. Taking turns providing bad news to the people that have loved and supported us and mom throughout our lives. They ask to come see her and we dont turn anyone away. They offer their condolences share their grief and without fault, \"let us know if we can do anything for you.\" Listen pal, if you can't design and build a functional time machine to take us back two weeks ago so that I can tell my mom i love her and please eat something please let's go to the hospital, then thank you I dont need anything right now but we will let you know.\n\nOne week after 6 people carried my mom out of my house on a tarp with handles, we have her vent removed. We invite the people who love my mom and want to be with her to come surround her with their love. We spend the day supporting each other and sharing stories of life with mom. I learn that my mom was selfless without fail. That she gave and gave of herself to allow others to grow and succeed. I learn that she loved tuna as a child and used to tease her siblings mercilessly. I learn of her time spent in the navy. I desperately wish that I had paid attention to these stories when she was able to share them herself. I wish that I wasn't learning about my mom through others.\n\nMy mom is the strongest person i know. I used to think it was my dad, but she has proven otherwise. She was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer less than two years ago after a mysterious 4 month illness and an er visit while working out of state. She stayed positive and optimistic throughout her initial diagnosis and treatment. She handled 5 months of immunotherapy treatment, pet scans, ct scans, lab work, and drs appointments with grace. Seven months ago, she fought through a debilitating hormone deficiency caused by the immunotherapy that hospitalized her for a month and stole her cognitive abilities. She rallied after that treatment and battled her way into awareness and relearning how to function on her own. Five months ago she had her kidney and a football sized cancerous tumor removed and was walking and in good recovery within two weeks. Less than two weeks before her stroke, she recieved the news that she no longer showed positive signs of cancer. \n\nThroughout all of this, she spent time with friends and family. She worked a full time job and provided support and advice for her coworkers and team members. She planned trips and did things that brought her happiness. She maintained her independence, her joy and love for life, and the overwhelming love and care she had for others. My mom really, truly lived a life worth living. It's so fucking unfair that it ends here, in a godamn hospital bed.\n\nMy mom has always been a stubborn woman. Doing things her own way, in her own time. And dying is no different. She holds strong. No doubt trying to prove to us that shes still in charge whether we like it or not. I take first and second overnight shifts. And its so cathartic to spend these nights with her. I dont talk to her much. Ive spent the last two years speaking the truths I needed to. Ive spent the last 8 days telling her that I love her, that we are proud of her, that we will all take care of each other for her. I fix her hair as best as I can, and wipe her face with a wet towel. I take comfort in caring for her like this at the end of her time.\n\nMy mom passes away within two hours of me going home on the third day she was off the vent. My brother was holding her hand and told her how much she is loved, how much she will be missed. As soon as he calls me, im getting redressed to go back to the hospital. My dad, uncle, brother, and I hold vigil over her body like silent grieving sentinels trying to soak up the last moments we can with her. \n\nMy mom will never see me fall in love again. She wont be there to gossip and gasp when i \"spill the tea\". She will miss my brothers wedding. She won't be there for the mother and son dance. She won't get to see my brother become a fantastic husband or father. She will not be at my son's graduation or be there to make jokes when he goes on his first date. My mom will not be there to help my dad navigate his health insurance or teach him how to use his phone. She won't be there to say oh, dad when he does or says something silly.\n\nMy mom never got to beat cancer. She didn't get her big retirement party. She didn't get to travel across the country again, or fly across the world. She never had the chance to say goodbye. \n\nOne month ago my mom was counting down the days until she could fly home and see our family.\n\nNine days ago, six people carried my mom out of my house on a tarp and today a part of me died with her.",

    "content": "I would like to share my story with you first.\n\nI come from a middle-class family. I didn't have so much of a hard life in the beginning, just average. My father left my mother because she cheated on him in his home at night with a tenant we were having, while my big brother(4-5 years old at that time) was in the same room that night. After that, there were only 3 of us until his death in 2013 when I was 13 years old. He was not a very great father, he never let us make our own decisions, beat us from time to time for our mistakes, and mostly kept us confined like we were not as free as others were at that time. He owned a small stationary shop outside of a government college making 18K INR a month, he didn't have many friends either, mostly living alone, watching TV every time he was at home, and never talking to us like father sons ever. He had 2 sisters and 3 brothers and he was the best among them adored by the little sister, his few friends, and some relatives. He was not good with us because he never wanted a marriage and felt like he was stuck with us by our mother who left him with us. But regardless of all that, he provided for us. For this reason, my brother leaned toward becoming an outlaw and argued with his father because he saw his friends having fun, being free, and having all kinds of stuff. And I on the other hand became the opposite, I was always scared of the beating. I became very uninvolved in things, starting to become very scared of everything, very soft-hearted, afraid of everything, having no friends, and no connections with anyone. Because of this, even my other siblings(including my big brother) made fun of me and never acknowledged me. I started having conversations with myself at the early age of 5 because I had nothing else, no TV, and no friends but was doing well in my studies.\n\nAfter my father's death, everything fell apart because we had no money to continue further. We never even cried for him. We rented our house to have the basic necessities fulfilled and complete my high school at that time. I started working for one of his friends in the market (also a stationary shop) part-time after college. At this point, I was finally free to make my own decisions, and made very bad ones. I started making some acquaintances and fell with the addicted ones. My grades started to decline and teachers started to notice this because I was always every teacher's favorite because of my nature and they knew about my story and they tried to help me but I was very ashamed to take their help because they could help me with money only and I never even today am comfortable with asking or taking anyone's money as I know the risk of burden and didn't want to disappoint them if I failed. \n\nAfter finishing high school I was lost because I had no money to continue with college and part-time work wasn't cutting it for me. After living like this for 4 more years in Dec 2020. I got in contact with one of my school buddies who had started his own startup and I asked him for a job he took me in as an office administrator and his assistant because he knew about my honesty, loyalty and dedication. I was very happy finally getting a respected job and an opportunity to grow but money was not so much 10k INR a month. I learned so many things on my own like basic accounting, payroll, managing the office, data everything. I started investing in myself, dressed better, worked on my people skills, and built connections. Soon he put me in charge of scheduling interviews and getting in touch with clients if they had any grievances. \n\nI was working with this girl closely with whom I spent like 4 hours a day with work. She is beautiful and smart and very charming and I liked talking to her because she was genuinely interested in me (for the first time in my life). We started hanging out after work and during lunch breaks. Three months later, she fell for me seeing how dedicated I was, and grateful I was for everything that was happening, and told me about her feelings, and told her I didn't want to ruin my friendship with you at first. But as time passed by I was also interested in her (seeing as she was the first ever girl interested in me for being who I am).  We started dating and I was afraid to go out with her because I didn't have money to take her out she was a well-being household so little by little I started telling her everything about me little my little and she was genuinely impressed and we both fell in love. She was okay with everything, she paid for the dates and I couldn't take her out so I would do dates in my home, cooking meals. Which made us so close. I couldn't explain the joy I was feeling. The first time someone so happy with what little i could do. For 2 years we were inseparable, we talked about our future, her mother was also impressed with me. I had stopped drinking and smoking because I was seeing the future now. I had never felt anything like this, we spent literally every day together. \n\nIn June 2023, she left for her MBA for 2 years and I wanted to go with her but couldn't as she had to be on campus every day. It was very hard for the first time being so distant. But we promised ourselves that this for 2 years only and this is a great opportunity to learn and grow on our own for 2 years so we can spend the rest of the time together and we'll be in touch every night via call. We got in touch every day in the beginning. But days pass on and as it was college she had to more involved, I understood this and we getting so much less time like 10 minutes a day in call. She told me everything about her day and the friends she is making there. I was very happy until she told me about a guy with whom she spent most of her time as he was the senior in her committee. She told me everything about him, like how he was like, what they talked about, everything. And I got the idea that he was trying to get her. A few days passed like this and came clean and warned her about this like no guy who doesn't want to get in your pants spends this much time with you and discusses all this with you. She ensured me there was nothing to worry about, its college and he is in my committee so what ifwe spend some time together. I was not okay with it but kept my cool. Every other day I wanted to know what was going on and one day we had an argument and I stopped talking with her for 3 days.\n\nAfter 3rd day, I called her missing her so much because in my entire day, I had no one to talk to because I work from home now and have no other friends. She told me they kissed for 2 seconds she was very sorry about it she felt attracted to him. My life felt apart even after I had warned her so many times, and the connection we had was worth nothing to her. She tried convincing me it was a mistake, I never wanted it, I want to be with you only. And I told her I couldn't do anything, I already told her she was my only thing, she was the closest thing to me as a family, friend. And maybe your love wasn't strong enough that made you do this. We didn't talk for few days and then I called her back. She was sorry and nothing else happened and i told her it was okay if you were feeling attracted in the beginning but if you would have told me in the beginning and listened to my warnings all this could have been avoided. I gave her a chance to win me back. We got on call every now and then but two weeks later I found out that same guy texted her he wanted to cuddle and texted her back me too. She justified this by saying she feeling lonely and never even went there. I just had enough. Everything fell apart for me. I blocked her. I just wanted to end myself, I never had cried this much before in my life. \n\nOn Sep 23 she came back to our hometown after her mid terms. We met and discussed, she told me that she doesn't want to anything right now with anyone, she doesn't have any feelings and wants to focus on life. I cried a lot in front of her, telling her that what we had was special and it can be again if you just gave it a chance. But she doesn't want to. I told her it was just a kiss and nothing more and we can move past this and I also apologize the way I behaved as I thought I was the one that pushed her away as she said I was behaving too obsessed. She also offered to go to therapy with me. One thing which set us apart was that we didn't have to lie any time during our 2 years and we were so proud of it and we can share anything and everything with each other.\n\nThen on 28th Sep, I really wanted to check if all those things she said was true or not. Like was it only a kiss. When she went to bathroom, I logged her WhatsApp on my laptop (Don't judge me please,  really wanted to know). And I found out everything was a lie. She was sleeping with guy who she kissed (I talked with the guy also because I wanted to know what it really just a kiss because she was asking forgiveness that time and wanted to be with me only but I said I want know from him). After that she ended things with him and now is in relationship with another person. This 2nd person also came to Raipur (city nearby ours) to meet her and she told me that her friend is coming for a birthday party in Raipur of a classmate (also a lie, birthday was real tho she was excited for him) and she needed me to drop her at the hotel. I droved for 1.5 hours (all the while she was texting with him and he knew I was the ex and she told her not to react or anything) and came back 1.5  hours back alone on an empty stomach as I had just woken up and she said it was urgent as the flight had already left. \n\nShe texted her best friend a while back as well that she doesn't see a future with me( I asked her this as well when she told me about the kiss that do you don't see a future, she said no she does see it).  \n\nIn my life i have never had a deep connection or even a connection with whom i can just spend some time with. No family, no friends, nothing. She was everything to me. I was willing to do anything. She made me believe I can do anything, I am the most honest and loyal person. She  helped with my inner conversations i am having since my childhood, taught me to meditate, and helped with my career. She was there for everything. I never wanted anything in my life just wanted fun, weed, drinking, no ambitions, thought this was my life only until i met her. I never wanted a family so bad (never even had one). I just craved for acknowledgement not for money in my life. I went into depression, lost my job because I couldn't focus, started smoking weed and drinking again every day because 24\\*7 I am thinking about her. I have lost weight, started losing hair and worse than earlier. Now I don't even know how to live anymore. I just want to end it now. \n\nSo all this time I was and still am working a CRM Manager on night shift for merely 16000. I was too depressed to stay in room and even in that city. So decided to go for a solo trip from Nov 23 as it was Diwali time and had no place to go to. I didn't have any savings so I took a loan of 3 lakhs at a very high interest rate because the company said they will increase my salary after 3 months. To this day has been a false promise. I don't even talk with anyone even if work related in my company just my manager only through WhatsApp dont even pick up his call.\n\nThis was my story, not the entirety of it but it's probably too long now.\n\nSo what I really need help is with my current situation which is I am 26 years old have no friends or family, no career, no money and is in a lot of debt. I am searching for a career which will give me purpose in life again, motivate me, keep me busy and start on my feet again. I really want to work where I can put my 100% in because I have nothing to do apart from that. But problem is i have searching for it for the last 14 months. I am asking for help because whatever I decide to I will only only one shot at it as I am already not in a very good situation mentally and financially and also my age a factor. \n\nThis is the first time I am coming out with this because I think I can't cope with this anymore. I have never shared it with anyone and didn't know where to ask help for. Please help me.\n\n",

    "content": "This is my first post, so apologies if I get anything wrong. Sorry in advance for the long post!\n\nContext: My mother passed away from colon cancer after I'd just turned 11. My father remarried my brother's childhood friend's mom when I was 14. So, I've known my stepmother my whole life. My father is a surgeon and my brother and I were essentially raised by my grandmother and nanny after my mother passed due to his busy schedule and coming home late from being on-call. My stepmother is a divorcee. \n\nMy (23f) relationship with my father has been on and off for the past 8 years ever since he married this woman - let's call her Jane. Jane, it seems, always wanted my father. The day after my mother died, she called him asking to go out for 'coffee' so she could be his shoulder to lean on. Not saying this isn't a kind gesture, but my father is introverted, and all of his friends were my mother's friends, so it was odd to the family that he accepted her request. Then, he started coming home later than usual (10-11pm on weekdays) and I'd be up waiting for him because we had a ritual of him tucking me in - I was still a child, after all. On weekends, my brother and I would be in the living room watching TV and we'd see 2 pairs of feet coming down the stairs - this was just the start. Soon, Jane moved in and took down all the photos of my mom and starting sleeping in her bed (not even 2 years after she'd passed - also thought this was odd). She knew from the start I didn\u2019t like her and she confronted me one day as I was crying, saying \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me in your life, but you don\u2019t have a choice. Your father and I are trying to start a new life together and I don\u2019t want you talking about your mom anymore.\u201d My father didn\u2019t believe me when I told him she said this.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2012, I slept over at a friend's house, only to return the next morning to have my parents tell me they eloped and were now married. This crushed me. I was 14. A few months later, my father told me he'd accepted a new position at a job a 2-hour drive away from home. Along with that, he decided we were going to move so he could be closer to this new job. But we didn't even move closer, we moved to a town SHE wanted to in the middle of nowhere, and still a 1-hour drive away from his work. This broke my heart, and my grandmother's heart, because she told me and reminded my father that he made a promise that he wouldn't move until I turned 18 and left for college. I know promises sometimes don't mean anything, but as a teen, it meant EVERYTHING to me and knowing that he broke that promise hurt me like hell (and still does.) Meanwhile, my brother and 2 new stepbrothers, all older than me, were already moved out for college so this didn\u2019t affect them. My father would wake up at 4AM, leave by 5AM, and didn\u2019t return until 9PM \u2013 he managed to avoid all the drama going on at home between me and Jane. At the time of the move, I was entering 10th grade, which was hard enough because despite the fact that it was a majority white-only school where I was one of the only POC, high school just sucks so moving after everyone had already made their friends in 9th grade was difficult for me. I was very much a timid student, as well. In high school, I had terrible insomnia and sometimes would only get an hour of sleep before school. This resulted in me sometimes missing the bus, and Jane would refuse to drive me to school, so I had to walk 3.5 miles and be even later than I already was \u2013 sure, this may have been a fault of my own, but this was my reality. \n\nFast forward 3 years \u2013 I manage to complete high school with depression and anxiety and decided to move to Boston for college (about 4 hours away from home). We barely have any contact, I\u2019m able to tolerate Jane when I visit in short amounts. I feel like I\u2019ve barely mentioned my father, and more about the times that I dealt with Jane, but the fact is that my father is living in his own bubble and doesn\u2019t realize the suffering his decisions put me through. He refuses to acknowledge the promise he made to my mother before she died about how he wouldn\u2019t move, refuses that Jane made my life miserable by not allowing me to have friends over, refuses that he didn\u2019t do anything to try to understand me. If you asked him, he\u2019d say nothing is wrong. He knows I don\u2019t like Jane but doesn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not even explaining myself correctly here. It was hard as a child to accept a new woman coming into my life. She had 2 sons of her own but never tried to get along with me or my older brother \u2013 she calls him a failure because he works at a supermarket and didn\u2019t finish college, unlike her sons who went to art school (and who also embody the meaning of \u2018starving artists\u2019). \n\nMy father and I speak every 2-3 weeks. What annoys me is when he asks why I don\u2019t call more often, why I don\u2019t tell him about major events (like new relationships, new jobs, moving, etc.), and then doesn\u2019t understand when I try to explain every instance of him ignoring my tears and anger toward the situation he chose to put me through. I told him once that he was \u201cruining my life\u201d, and he told me that \u201cat some point, you need to get over your mom\u2019s death.\u201d Someday when he\u2019s old, he\u2019s gonna wonder \u201cgee, I haven\u2019t heard from my daughter in a while, I wonder why?\u201d. \n\nMore recently, my parents sent my partner and I a ham over Easter. I am Jewish and also never ate ham when I lived at home, so Jane knows I don\u2019t eat it. That coupled with the fact that I like to eat mainly vegetarian. My father called and asked if I\u2019d received in, I said yes, and he said \u201cit would have been nice if you thanked Jane, it was her idea to send one to you and the boys.\u201d Well, I\u2019d decided not to thank her, because one, I don\u2019t fucking eat ham, and two, I didn\u2019t ask for it - and whatever you may be thinking, I just didn't feel like thanking her. This erupted into a yelling match between my father and I \u2013 with me saying \u201cshe\u2019s not my mother and I never liked her, I love YOU and that\u2019s all that matters, I do NOT want her in my life.\u201d He replied with \u201cyou know, you should really think about what you do and say\u201d and I responded with, \u201cLOL, says you, the guy who uprooted my entire life for some bimbo who wanted your money, while ignoring the needs of his young children. You don\u2019t get to tell me how I feel.\u201d It ended there.\n\nSo here\u2019s the problem: I love my dad. As toxic and dumb as I think some of the things he does and has said are, he\u2019s still my dad. He\u2019s my dad, but, I still can\u2019t forgive many of the things he did to me. He just doesn't understand the pain he put me through. I don\u2019t want to have to cut him out of my life. He put me through college without me having to take out loans or work a job so I could focus on school, he always put my education first, and he paid for all my medical bills when I got into a car accident that broke my ankle last year. However, he was never there for me emotionally. If we can have a relationship exclusive of Jane, is that even possible? I can\u2019t even stand when he mentions her passively, like \u201cwe went to see a movie this weekend\u201d, or \u201cJane went to this art show recently\u2026\u201d I feel that I\u2019m an adult and can make this serious of a decision, but I don\u2019t know what to do. What about when I get married, and want to invite my dad but NOT Jane? Would he even show up? What about when I have kids someday, and refuse to let her touch them? She is NOT their grandmother. I\u2019m just stuck. I need help, y\u2019all. But I know I wouldn\u2019t be going back and forth this much if I didn\u2019t truly love him. \n\ntldr; I love my dad but hate my stepmom. He\u2019s made many decisions that have influenced my dislike of her and has been absent in trying to understand my point of view. Can my father and I have a relationship without my stepmom or is that not possible?",

    "content": "Three years ago, I was a paranoid man. Night after night, I obsessively wrote about my fear of losing control on myself. I treated it like a premonition, that I was soon to be \"overrun.\" My diary was like my own gospel, and my writing hand never got tired for it.\n\nOne day, a woman my age came into my life. We were perfect for each other. Not because of what we could be, but because of the same inner wound we had. I'll call her K. here.\n\nK. was a classmate of mine three years ago. One day during lunch break, she was smiling at me. See, she was seated in front of me. And during that very lunch break, that same shy and fragile girl decided to be brave and hand me her phone. There was nothing else to be said, only a contact for me to put in. And ever since then started an unbelievable page of my life.\n\nK. was a nice person, nothing wrong about her. She's genuine, thoughtful, observant, and she's the strongest person I know. As for me, I used to be an honors student\u2014my grandparents' trophy till one day I decided to give up and slack off.\n\nK. was perfect, and anybody would have taken their chance with her if only she let them. I never knew why she chose me, only that she kept coming back no matter how much we broke up that I couldn't count. I was manipulative, and I confused love for control. Till one day, I remember a night I regret to this day: I told the same depressed girl to k*ll herself.\n\nFast forward to the school year that came after, she dumped me for a man way better. Taller, stronger, nicer, more attractive, but I didn't feel jealousy in its entirety. It was already months past that she decided to leak our conversations that killed my reputation. People hated me, and I know why. Because of all the bad things I told her everyday just so I could control her. I cried every single day, inside every room I could lock myself in, and in every long shower I'd have every other hour. When she left me for one last time, it was like I was in a new soul in another body. For I didn't recognize myself, as I still can't to this day.\n\nThat very school year that came after, K. had broken up with her boyfriend. K. and I would spend that rest of the school year stealing glances at each other. Each and every time I catch her, I would always be the one to look away.\n\nAnd one day came, as the guys in our classroom bullied me for days, an unknown thug stood up and fought for me. Let's call him R. And R. pretended to be my cousin, just so people wouldn't dare cross me again.\n\nEver since then, from September to November, R. and I fought outside their yard so I could ease my mind on fighting. It was a release I couldn't get off of writing. And ever since then, I forgot about my diary. It wasn't long that I spent most of my time hanging out with R., even as far as to drink near the school, and waste myself away.\n\nI've fought so many times that I could not count anymore. I framed a sketchier-looking man of a much more exaggerated form bullying because I was so pissed at him trying to trip me and throwing a paper airplane at my head. One day, he stood before me at the hall before school. My punch made his mouth bleed, while he couldn't make a bruise on me.\n\nBy then, reuniting with K. was off my mind. I knew that coming back wouldn't do so well with my new life. The day before graduation day was the day K. caught me looking instead of the other way around. And finally, after a year, she was the first to look away. Graduation came, and I could not have been more alone. K. was out of sight, the same depressed girl now surrounded by friends and family. While I didn't even have my parents with me. My thug friends didn't care much about school either. Just me, myself, and I.\n\nAs vacation went by, I had a new girlfriend that I'll call A. I knew A. ever since fifth grade, and we've seen each other grow into so many different people. That even if by high school that we lived so far away, we'd pay so much just to date again. A. was the perfect girlfriend. She was smarter, more independent, more diligent and driven. While after a year of constant storm, I was this gloomy husk of a person that used to be her best friend.\n\nShe didn't give up on me. Till one day, she laid her head on my shoulder throughout a long ride. I felt like somebody. Long before we knew it, we've gone to many places we never knew we'd go with just the two of us together. Saying our very first \"I love you\" was the most earned thing we've ever said. I wanted to live forever again.\n\nI knew about A's history of coercion with her past boyfriends. She was often forced into handjobs, even making out in the most public places. It was so unlike the A. I used to know. All because she decided to love truly and never play anybody again.\n\nOne day, she invited me at her place\u2014an hour-long ride from the way I came. We waited till her two siblings were sleeping, and then we made out for hours in her parents' bedroom when she pulled my arm there. Her sister would snoop from time to time, making excuses like asking me to turn off the TV and all that. An hour before I left, A. was already humping me while we still had our clothes on. We've already sworn not going past kissing, but by the time she tried to stick her chest into my face, I couldn't stop myself from repeatedly asking her for second base even if it made her so quiet. I tried to touch her chest, as she immediately put my hands away. But it didn't matter, because I got there anyway.\n\nEver since then, she didn't stop talking about wanting to do it again. She suggested we escalate, saying we make out in our underwear. A. once \"tested\" me, faked begging me for real sex. It felt so real, and I freaked out a lot. I was still trying to be careful of her trauma. Because every now and then, she'd cry about her fear of me becoming just like her old exes. Liking her for her body.\n\nJust when I was about to head to their place again, her sister told on us. I don't know why I didn't cry as we were forced to break up, but I'd always remember her wishes for me to get my honor roll again like I did before, her wishes for me not to drink or hang out with bad influences. In the end, she wanted me to live a by-the-book life.\n\nThe last talk we had was met with her anger. She said so many things she hated about me. And in the end, she said I was \"just like them.\" And I didn't fight back on that. I didn't want to hurt her. She said she hid the jacket I gave her to somewhere she couldn't see. And that was it. We were done.\n\nI grinded through school with the delusion of her worry. That if I died, she'd cry. That if I made it out, she'd be proud of me. That school year, I was still alone. What's different was that time I finally got to stand in front of everyone to get my diploma and a picture. I still didn't have my parents with me, but I have my honors. And even if that achievement felt so empty, it was already the best kind of joy I could have ever had beyond eating alone at restaurants or buying new clothes with my allowance every single week. I couldn't force joy with any type of self-compassion, so I wanted to excel for a mental image of her.\n\nEver since K. came into my life, it has been three years now. I'm in my final year before college, and I'm turning eighteen in five months. I still have nobody, and it's already been a year since I've last talked to A. Yet every night, I'd pretend she's still here. To the point that I was told that I was found laughing in my sleep. I still don't know what happened to the jacket I gave her. But after my good grades from last year, I already feel like I accomplished life. And that I have nothing else to do.\n\nRight now, I'm 17 and ready to sleep forever. I'm past beyond the point of regret or heartbreak, only a wish for everything to be wiped off the table. Every night, I'd always stay awake, for I've always hated the busy work of day. I still have so many things to do. And I don't know why I'm just not actively suicidal enough to make plans for me to die. But right now, I don't even ask myself whether to live or die. Only wondering, what do I do? What do I do for every burden in my head to be truly gone? It's not like I have money for therapy, nor do I have people to rely on.\n",

    "content": "My sister (32F) and I (31F) have always had a tumultuous relationship, shaped largely by our childhood and family dynamics. Growing up, she was clearly my parents\u2019 golden child. She was pretty, popular, and excelled at almost everything she tried. My parents highly value prestige and public visibility, and I think they saw her as their ticket to having a \u201cnotable\u201d child.\n\nI, on the other hand, was more of a bookworm. I wasn\u2019t ugly, but I was overweight at times and not especially fashionable as a teenager, basically a normal kid. My parents constantly pushed me to participate in the same activities as my sister, hoping I would become more like her. At the time, I didn\u2019t mind much because I genuinely loved my older sister and admired how liked and admired she was. It didn't matter to me that she always prioritized her friends over me saying that she wished they were her sisters.\n\nUnderneath all of this was a constant undercurrent of abuse and neglect. My parents owned a business in the next city over and spent a significant amount of time there, which left a lot of household and family responsibilities on my shoulders. Home was stressful and unpredictable. Many evenings I cooked and cleaned out of fear, fear that if my parents came home and things weren\u2019t done, I would face physical or emotional abuse. Every night I listened anxiously for my father\u2019s booming voice calling down the stairs.\n\nI also had a strong sense of justice, and my refusal to silently accept the abuse made me a frequent target. I was constantly belittled for my appearance, my weight, my grades, anything could be used against me. Both of my parents were physically abusive, mostly my father. My siblings, including my sister, older brother, and younger brother, also participated in physical abuse toward me. I have since forgiven my siblings, understanding the environment we were raised in, but the damage was still real.\n\nThe favoritism was blatant. My parents attended every one of my sister\u2019s events, awards ceremonies, plays, sports, while rarely showing up for anything if I was the only one involved. After high school, they paid for everything related to my sister\u2019s college education, rent even though she lived with her boyfriend, phone, spending money, trips home, insurance, everything. When it came to me, I was told to figure it out or go without. At the time, my self-esteem was so low that I accepted this as my own fault for not being \u201cdeserving\u201d enough.\n\nThere were occasional gestures, dinners or gifts, but my sister was always the priority. One particularly painful example was my first Thanksgiving spent alone in my college dorm, far from home. My parents flew my sister out to stay with me so she would not be lonely. While there, she spent the entire visit obsessively texting her boyfriend, whom she was fighting with. He eventually broke up with her, and she had a complete breakdown. This was not the first time she reacted dramatically to a breakup, but it was by far the worst.\n\nShe ended up in the hospital, where staff privately pulled me aside and told me they recommended psychiatric admission. (I now strongly believe that she has bipolar disorder based on many other events like this over the years.) They handed me a form to sign if I agreed. Terrified, I called my parents. They panicked, not over her health, but over her future, and threatened to disown me if I \u201cjeopardized her future out of jealousy.\u201d I took her home instead and completely spiraled. I failed almost every final that semester. When I returned home, my parents pretended nothing had happened. They gaslit me, telling me I was exaggerating and that my sister was just stressed from being so smart, something I would understand if I worked harder.\n\nThis pattern continued for years. Whenever my sister had relationship problems or conflicts or things did not go her way, she would implode, and my parents would rush to her side to fix everything. Eventually, she married and earned a graduate degree. Meanwhile, I struggled with depression and moved back home, attending a cheaper local college. My parents did not believe in \u201chandouts,\u201d so I worked full time while going to school, which only worsened my mental health.\n\nMy parents eventually moved away. I lost my lease due to living in a HCOL area, dropped out of college, and couch-surfed for months until they paid for me to move out of state to live with them. Once there, it quickly became clear they mainly wanted me around to cook, clean, and manage the household, and the abuse resumed. I eventually left and became financially independent and succesful, though that story stands on its own.\n\nDuring COVID, I met my husband, and we are now very happily married. Unfortunately, my wedding day was another major disappointment. My entire family let me down, most notably my sister, who was my maid of honor and disappeared for most of the day with a friend.\n\nAround the same time, my sister\u2019s marriage began deteriorating due to financial stress, interpersonal conflict, and her long work hours. The relationship was never a good fit, and they did not resolve their issues. She eventually filed for divorce explicitly so that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be cheating,\u201d as she wanted to sleep with someone else. She claimed she had \u201cfelt divorced\u201d long before telling her husband, and I strongly suspect she had already been seeing other people.\n\nShortly after, my mother also filed for divorce from my father, largely influenced by my sister, who insisted my mother was being abused. While that may or may not have been true, neither divorce went smoothly, and I was expected to shoulder the emotional burden of both my sister and my mother. They began going on girls trips where they only spoke badly about men and got blackout drunk with other women, usually in party cities or other countries. I didn't feel comfortable going on these trips as I love my husband very much and I am also now sober. There is also a financial consideration as I work full time. She and my mother said that I was \"stuck up and felt like I was better than everyone else\". I offered alternative trips where we could have a quieter time (spa retreat, that sort of thing) and they both declined. \n\nA couple of years later, after the divorce and while I was in my sister\u2019s city for a conference, she confessed that she was sleeping with a married coworker who had children. I strongly advised her to stop. I believe cheating is deeply wrong, especially when innocent kids are involved. I shared my views with her and tried to get her to have empathy for the man's wife and family. From that point on, she began pushing me away and our relationship never recovered. \n\nShe only contacted me when things went badly with him. At those times, she treated me like an emotional punching bag and screamed that I did not understand \u201creal love.\u201d I tried to support her while encouraging her to leave. She would then cut me off again, lie about breaking up with him, and secretly resume the relationship. When I'd call her on it she would say horrible things to me, imply my marriage was suffering, and bad mouth me to her friends. I'd also get super long abusive text messages telling me what a terrible sister I was and that she didn't love me because I don't want her to be happy. Eventually, we stopped speaking entirely, though her best friend and I stayed in touch out of concern.\n\nAbout a year ago, she revealed that the man had been abusive and was threatening her career (exactly what I warned her about). She hired a lawyer and decided to sue both him and their workplace. The cops were also involved at one point but that went nowhere. The case is still ongoing, so I cannot share more details. Her expectation was that this revelation should excuse all of her past behavior toward me. Basically that everything was her abusers fault and not hers. While I fully acknowledge that what she went through was horrible, I told her it did not excuse years of manipulation and abuse toward me that predated this situation. After all, her abuser didn't force her to send those messages or treat me like a punching bag. \n\nWith my husband\u2019s support, I finally understood that the way my family treated me was not normal. I told my sister that if we were going to have a relationship, I needed her to take responsibility for the choices that kept leading her into dangerous relationships, because the next one could kill her and her behavior has a profound impact on my mental health. Since then, she has avoided me and tried to isolate me from remaining family members. She eventually started telling people that I'm \"not a girl's girl\" and don't believe women.\n\nThe final breaking point is happening now. She is threatening to sue our father over a totally separate family issue involving a late relative\u2019s personal property. I believe this is mostly being driven by my mother who hates that my father is now getting remarried and is trying to punish him. Both my younger brother and I are strongly opposed to the lawsuit and know for a fact that  my father has done nothing wrong. Because of the conflict, my younger brother, who lives near me, asked my sister to cancel her Christmas visit to see him, as he does not want to spend all of the break arguing with her. For years, he has spent Christmas with my husband's family and me, and we have established our own traditions. My sister, by contrast, has usually chosen to spend Christmas traveling with friends.\n\nNow my sister and my mother are texting me, saying I ruined her Christmas and that she will be alone. Mind you, I wasn't involved in that decision at all and my husband and I were prepared to have her. We even bought gifts and stocking so she wouldn't feel left out. She claims she is deeply depressed, that she is an abuse victim, and that she needed family support this year. So being alone might mean she'll hurt herself. Meanwhile, my brother told me she was complaining that she did not even want to come to my house and was trying to convince him to skip it. He clarified that he was dreading her coming out to see him and that he just didn't want to spend the holidays seeing her drink and complain about how bad her life is. He just wants to do normal Christmas stuff and chill out. \n\nI'm worried about her still of course, but I feel so relieved that she won't be here. Every time she is around we end up fighting because she always has to be right about everything and won't let up until you agree with her. I want to have a relationship with her but I think it might be time to finally walk away from the relationship with her and my mother so I can find peace. ",

    "content": "Sorry in advance for the long post. To provide some background, my partner and I's dog is elderly and we love him very much. People who don't love dogs or don't believe in providing decent care for a dog (or animals in general) should stop reading now, I am not interested in debating whether animals deserve care. Anyway, our dog was formerly kind of my partner's family dog, though Dog was taken in when he was a puppy and my partner and his siblings were all adults. It was a decision made by two members of the family (of which my partner was not one) who \"surprised\" the rest of the family with the puppy. Everyone adjusted as well as they could, and Partner grew to really love Dog, and so did I, as our relationship went on. We moved in together few years ago and took Dog with us as no one has volunteered to take on his care and we did not trust Partner's parents enough to leave him in their care for the remainder of his life.\n\nOn to the issue. Dog has developed a number of medical conditions in his old age, a couple of which are a severe heart murmur and pulmonary hypertension. At the time of the hospitalisation, he was on many medications and we were having a lot of trouble administering the pills/tablets in particular and were having to put them in his food. He stopped eating, and because one of the pills keeps his lungs clear, a lot of fluid accumulated in his lungs as a result. He was looking quite unwell so we took him to the veterinary emergency hospital, where we found out that his heart murmur had progressed to heart failure. He was not getting enough oxygen and needed to be put into basically a high-oxygen cage until he could breathe normally again. We were told that he may not recover and had to sign a do-not-resuscitate order, it was very upsetting. We entrusted the vets with Dog's care and told them to call us at any time whenever there is an update.\n\nGiven that his family has a prior relationship with Dog (some care more than others), Partner and I tend to keep them updated on major events such as diagnoses, so I agreed to Partner calling a couple of family members on our drive home and filling them in, as well as posting a general message in the family group chat. During the two calls, he stated the name of the hospital where Dog was being kept. I had a bad feeling about that, but couldn't take back the information he had given so I just said after the calls \"you shouldn't have told them which hospital\".\n\nIt was quite late when we got home and we were emotionally drained, so we went to bed. At 3am, the hospital called us and said that Dog was doing okay so they were going to conduct a \"room air test\" on him, which would basically determine whether he could get enough oxygen breathing normal air rather than the oxygen-saturated air he had been on. We agreed and went back to sleep hoping for the best.\n\nAs soon as we woke up at around 9am, we called the hospital for an update. To our surprise, we were told that an update had already been provided and the vets were not available to provide another update. Partner pressed for more information and was told that a woman had called an hour or two beforehand, had been given an update, and had asked about visiting Dog in hospital. We looked at the family chat and saw a message from Partner's mother announcing that she was driving down to visit Dog that day. Partner's family members all live over an hour's drive away. Partner called her and got her side of the story: she had looked up the hospital and called them asking about Dog, intending to make arrangements to visit him, but instead they put his vet on the phone and she got told a bunch of information about his medical conditions that she did not understand as she has not been caring for him. I'm not sure whether the hospital staff realised that she wasn't either Partner or I, because she rambles a lot when she recounts events and it's hard to get a straight answer.\n\nI was livid. We were anxious to hear how the test had gone, but could not get the information because she had butted in. No call to us, no waiting, just went over our heads and straight to the hospital to ask when she could visit. Because of her actions, we didn't find out for a few more hours that he had failed the test and was back on oxygen again. We also had not been planning on visiting him so that the staff could concentrate on getting him well again, but we were now having to coordinate a visit with the hospital for Partner's mother and another family member who also decided they wanted to see Dog. The visit was awful, by the way. He was struggling for breath the whole time, because the temporary portable oxygen cage he was in was not airtight, and he was distressed as he couldn't understand why he wasn't allowed to touch us when we were all right in front of him. The vet seemed to take forever to come back and retrieve him.\n\nThankfully he came home the next night and we have found more reliable ways to administer his medication, as he struggles too much when we try to put it in his mouth by ourselves too. He was hospitalised once more since then but has been stable for a while now. We are keeping him as comfortable as we can. When I've told friends what happened, it's pretty much 50-50 between the hospital and Partner's mother for who they think is responsible for that disclosure of information. From my perspective, the reality is that animals do not have patient confidentiality rights etc to protect against these things. Additionally, I can't imagine that veterinary hospitals would usually encounter people other than primary carers calling about a patient like a human hospital would, because unfortunately there are inheritances and reputations and just higher emotions at stake for human patients compared to pets. So I think that it was reasonable for the hospital to assume that the person calling was one of the dog's owners. Ideally we would have put a rule in place with the hospital about only disclosing Dog's information to us, but the need just didn't occur to us. I believe wholeheartedly that what Partner's mother did was completely inappropriate and showed a lack of respect for us as the primary carers. It added so much stress to an already stressful and upsetting situation for us.\n\nI know that I might be holding Partner's mother to a higher standard than the veterinary hospital, by expecting her to treat the situation as if Dog was a human in our care and deferring to us, but the reality is that she loves Dog as a family member (or claims to) whereas I would not expect the hospital to protect patient information like a human hospital would, unfortunately that's just not the way the world is. So am I wrong to blame her for the delay in getting information about our dog's health?",

I checked online and it seems that there's only an official translation in Portuguese of this book, but none in English.\n\nAlberto Moravia was one of the greatest writers and intellectuals of 20th century's Italy. He went in India in 1960 and he collected his impressions in this book.\n\nYou can find the first chapter here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qcxkxu/1960\\_italian\\_book\\_about\\_india\\_an\\_idea\\_of\\_india\\_un/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qcxkxu/1960_italian_book_about_india_an_idea_of_india_un/)\n\nI will post the following chapters in the next weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**An evening, in India**\n\nHere I am in India, in the countryside, few miles from Aurangabad, the town known to the tourists for being close to the sculpted and painted caves of Ajanta and Ellora. It's evening, with a green light, pure and sad in the clear sky, in which a big white star is shining already.  From the hotel,which sits upon a hill, I have a view on a broad landscape which I will see several times again because India is immense, but monotonous.   Picture a coppice, or a thicket, teeming, as far as the eye can see ,with short shrubs and bushes, some isolated large tree here and there, and the yellow of the sandy and arid soil unfolding wherever there's a clearing. Sometimes, the frame of a cultivated field, light green, stands out from the woods, gently visible in all of its stems.\n\nDoubtful, dusty, chipped hills surrounds the far horizon without really enclosing it, so that the main feature of this not so picturesque but expressive landscape, is a funereal grandiosity, to which the perfect stillness of the air gives a sense of weary wait, of tired calmness.  From the hotel, through a gravel path, between two great English-styled flowerbeds, I descend to the entrance. On the flowerbeds are enormous trees, with sturdy, fleshy, soft trunks, loaded with a heavy and fat foliage. Large black crows, as if there were a battlefield scattered with corpses, hoover from tree to tree, croaking with loud voices.\n\nHere I am at the wide-opened gate. Here is the main road leading to Aurangabad. A snake charmer who was awaiting the European tourists at the gate, as soon as he sees me, he rushes to squat down,he opens his bag and he plays few notes with his cane fife, whilst the cobra rises and graciously oscillates, innocent and faithful like a pet.   But, even if the man, with his pathetic snake, moves me to pity (the most common felt feeling, travelling across India) , I prefer to look at the main road : It's the time of the day,when, all across the world, the farmers return their homes; even here the exodus is the same as is in other rustic Countries, so much so that for a second, I could believe to be in Spain, in Greece, or in southern Italy.\n\nWalking, trotting, even galloping, with an almost comical effect, akin to the one made by some Neapolitan carts sped up by their eccentric drivers, amid the yellow dust, the \u201cbullock-carts\u201d parade before me, the Indian carts towed by a couple of bullocks.  They're tall and narrow carts, coarsely made, with large and massive wheels and a long,heavy rudder.  The two bullocks are very small, (all the domesticated animals in India, maybe due to atavistic malnourishment, are smaller than in Europe, the bullocks as well as the hens, which are the size of a dove and their eggs are half the size of ours) , so scrawny that their shape is almost geometrical , white, with kind black eyes and horns of a strange shape,expressing meekness,that is touching together at the top, like flower petals.\n\nAt the wheel, sits the farmer, a leg bent, the other one hanging, his head wrapped in a big turban, bare-chested, a white cloth around his loins. Just like for the landscape, I am going to see over and over again this farmer and his bullocks, as well. The colour of his turban and the shape of his cloth will slightly vary but his expression will always be the same : an admixture of patient resignation, imperturbable ignorance and ancestral melancholy. And even the facial traits will not greatly differ from North to South, the most of them being of a surprising purity and nobility, very different from the urban Indian kind, who's almost proud of being fat and plump, as it often happens in malnourished Countries.\n\nBut ,for a European, the most important feature of Indian humanity is the open, and ready communicability and expressivity of their faces ; in this sense, the Indian is closer to the Europeans than to his asiatic brothers of semitic and mongolic races \\*( \\*Middle Easterners and East and South-East Asians) , who are often really uncommunicative and mysterious, according to a conventional stereotype.On the cart, there's often the farmer alone, but sometimes, behind him ,I can see the whole family : the woman, wrapped in the veils of a green or red sari, sitting on her legs, with a hand and her chin resting on her husband's shoulder, her big black eyes giving an apprehensive look; next to her , are three or four children ,often completely naked, but with the heads adorned with fresh flowers; behind them , are a wrinkled granma and a hoary granpa, resting on the bales of hay.   The children  are particularly impressive, for the explosive liveliness of their sparkling eyes and  their laughter, so white in their dark faces.\n\nThese children as well, will I see over and over again through my travel across India, always adorned with fresh flowers, always laughing and carefree, always innocently and completely naked. But their liveliness does not inspire happiness. It's impossible not to think that it will not last long, just like the deceptive purity and coolness of the morning are short-lived in this Country. Suddenly, with the adolescence, here the man grows thoughtful and resigned, just like the day, as soon as the sun rises, becomes tired and oppressive.\n\nThe exodus now, is almost over, while the green twilight is replaced by the night's darkness and there are only left the typical beggars of the Indian streets : mysterious children wandering in the dimness, in groups of two or three, holding their hands together ; small old women, unkempt and emaciated, with their sari in tatters and a long pilgrim stick ; the young gypsy lady, very dark, with frantic eyes,  covered with silver bracelets and necklaces of hard stones ; the leper reaching out his fingerless hand, the aluminum pot hanging from the wrist ; and also just common people who, having seen me, think it's a good idea to reach out the hand. Even these professional and non professional beggars, am I going to see over and over again during my journey across India, sadly.\n\nBut we should clarify here, that whilst in Europe, beggars have their exceptional reasons to do their exceptional job, in India, a beggar's hand reaching out is akin to the hand extended to pick a fruit hanging from a tree branch : The reasons that cause so many Indians to beg for charity aren't particular or extraordinary. At the origin of this gesture, there's a universal condition of extreme poverty, often sided by a job pursued with competence and assiduity, so much so that the charity in India, is almost a right for those who ask for it ,and almost a duty for those who do it.\n\nI am going to Aurangabad. They say it counts around 150.000 inhabitants but at first sight ,it looks like a big rustic town.  It's night and the tortuous street, lined between two rows of two-story huts, with the second floors, teeming with crumbling and decaying balconies, and their ground floor shops blazing with light, inspires at first, the sense of a mysterious opulence a l\u00e0 \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights\u201d  ,it's the same old mirage of the miserable and magical East, due to which every  village resembles a Golconda. The shops, tiny and brimming with goods, are on top of three or four steps, because the open sewer runs between the buildings and the sidewalk.\n\nAs seen from below, with their old golden mirrors,the ruined rugs, the decrepit furnitures, the vendors squatting on the ground , they lure with the illusion of who knows which products of an exotic and ingenuous craftmanship . But it's a short-lived illusion .Once inside, you find the same old mass-produced items : shoes and hats, household utensils, cotton fabrics, Anglo-American pharmaceutical items made in India, horrendous souvernirs for the tourists, of silver and ivory.  The exoticism seeks shelter in the steaming fried food shops, where they serve lively-coloured food, saffron-yellow or paprika-red ; and in the spice shops, where they exhibit,in cups, piramids of grains of violet, green and orange flours. But the real exoticism is in an air of obsessive and pervasive corruption ; the Indian climate darken and decompose,but doesn't ripen.\n\nThe town, at this hour, is all down on the street, or to be more precise, the men only, in groups, outside of the shops. They confabulate, but they don't buy anything, and the impassive vendors don't seem to be expecting to sell anything, either. Even this crowd of men, with their beautiful, variously knotted turbans and their white clothes, artistically wrapped around the hips, seem attractive and mysterious from afar, just like the oriental characters on the background of Venetian painters. But, once up-close, you realize that they are the same simple farmers just seen before on the main road. The town shines and swarms for a few hours after the sunset, then, one after the other, the shops' lights turn off, the vendors shut down the shops with bars and axles and go upstairs where you can hear them moving and talking before falling asleep.\n\nNow the street is almost completely dark. On top of the sidewalk, over the sewer, the homeless inhabitants of Aurangabad are sleeping already, laying here and there like corpses, their head wrapped in a rag. The street, instead, is the dormitory of the sacred cows, which don't have an owner and hopelessly wander about the shops and the alleys, respected by everyone, fed by noone.   There's plenty of them laying down on the asphalt, like huge stray dogs. However ,even when so dark and quiet, the street still retains some of its oriental charm, due to the jackals' howling from the countryside, to which the dogs answer barking from the dark alleys .\n\nIt will take the full daylight, to unfold all its poverty and weariness.",

    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI've seen this community being supportive of each other. Figured I could use some advice and help. This is gonna be a long post as I'm pouring my heart out.\n\nI fucked up. Big time.\n\nI'm just one of your regular guys; 26 years old, techie, etc etc.; from south India, from a fairly conservative family. They've been extremely supportive my whole life, and never really obstructed to anything that I wanted to do. At the age of 22, I met this one girl who was my colleague at that time. Let's call her A. She was from Delhi. We instantly clicked and became best friends. She was with someone else at that time, who she realized was just an emotionally abusive guy. We used to share everything between each other, with no real feelings of love or anything. We were just best friends, talking 3-4 hours a day.  A few months later, I moved to the US for my masters, while she was still in India. We continued to be in touch. I realized she was way too smart to be working in a stupid IT company and convinced her to pursue her masters as well. Helped with everything - from her application process, helping her with her travel arrangements, and helping her settling down after she reached here. (She enrolled in the same university as me - different course though). Somewhere in this time, I started developing feelings for her. She was going through a rough patch at that time with her ex. And after a few months, I asked her out and she said no, as she was still not over that guy. I spent the next 4 months crying every single night and was in depression - I was in my final semester of my masters, with only a couple of months left to graduate, with no job offer in hand or any internship experience. At some point in time, I decided to move on and found someone else. I had this extremely fucked up status quo with this new girl - When we'd meet and hang out, we'd have the best time. But otherwise there wouldn't be any sort of communication between us. Though I had moved on from my friend, I was still in touch with her. We'd meet often and hang out - we also had a huge group of friends. We still cared for each other.\n\nJune 2018  - got my degree, got my job. Everyone's happy.\n\nI told my parents about girl no 2. And they met her and they were happy. I met her parents and they were happy. It all seemed good; except for the fact that the girl would ghost me, every now and then. She'd never call, pick up my calls or reply for a few days. And then she'd come back as if nothing happened. I was too blinded by my stupidity to see how badly I was being played by her. I was pissed off for a long time, but I was just too stupid to see it for what it was.\n\nMarch 2019;\n\nWhile I was in this emotionally fucked up state, A and I were talking every day and were still being extremely supportive of each other. We were spending a lot of time together. On the phone, or text, or in person. And one fine day, she asked me out. Now, this was the first time a girl ever asked me out. I've never really heard of that kinda stuff until then - I've always come across only guys asking out girls, not the other way around. And I was never in a relationship before. I started freaking out. She asked me to take some time to think about it, as I was overwhelmed at that point in time.\n\nGrowing up, I saw two of my cousins marry outside the caste and their parents ( my mom's siblings) went through extreme depression. They were always ridiculed by other relatives and they were just emotionally distraught. I knew my parents wouldn't be able to take such a news from me - given their age and the laundry list of health problems that they have. I knew if I told her yes, that was a commitment I had to stick to - no matter what.  And that would mean putting my family through extreme pain. I didn't want to tell her a yes, knowing the constraints in my house and then later, tell her that things won't work out - felt that would be cheating her. I feared I'd lose my parents if I just dropped the bomb on them one fine day that, Hey guys, I've been dating someone for 2 years now. And I wanna marry her now. They're not fundamentally opposed to a love marriage - they'd be okay with anyone with the caste / community. And that's how they got married 35 years back. But for them, a north indian girl was something they weren't able to take visualize. They met her and really liked her - as my friend. Their viewpoints were different - and had nothing to do with her as  person. They really respected her. They lived their entire life in a conservative environment and weren't ready to take that culture shock that she would bring. At the same time, she was my best friend. We saw each other grow into better human beings. We understood each other, and considered the other's success as our own. I couldn't tell her no either. I wanted to make sure my parents were on board - so that everyone would be happy in the end. I didn't want any drama later in life - besides, her parents, even though they really liked me, would be super unhappy if they get to know that their daughter wasn't being welcomed with open arms into my house.\n\nThis tug-of-war continued for 6 months. I couldn't give her any answer. I wasn't able to convince my parents one bit until then. And to add to all this, my work became super stressful. Coupled with the fact that I've always had low self confidence, and self esteem issues. I was under immense stress for all angles. She understood all of it, and was being supportive. But in the end, I started feeling she deserves better than me, and in some ways, started pushing her away. Never being in a relationship before scared the shit out of me of that commitment of being a \"boyfriend\". Even though, for all inten and purposes, we were already like a couple. I didn't want to lose her, or my parents. After 6 months of struggling with being in a limbo state, she decided to move on. She blocked me. I knew she snapped, and she deserved some space. I reached out to some friends to make sure she was okay. This distance just continued growing, and now, after almost 9 months later, we haven't spoken yet. I kept myself busy with work and other hobbies, but I still continued to talk to my parents about her, hoping that if they finally come around, I'd run back to her and live my life happily with her. AND THEY BLOODY DID. They came around finally, and accepted that they let their fears and biases blur their thinking. And were willing to talk.\n\nBut,\n\nshe had moved on. I should have seen this coming, but I was just to scared to think about it. She moved on, found another guy, and is now engaged to him. My world turned upside down. My insides churned after hearing this. I had this feeling of emptiness that , I remember, I had when I got to know my grandmother passed away. The realization that this person wouldn't be in life anymore just isn't sinking in. In all fairness to her, I don't blame her for what she did. I wasn't confident at that time that I could conquer the mountain in front of me, and I couldn't give her that confidence either. She deserved happiness, after all she's been through with her ex, and now me. She's an amazing person who, I pray, lives the best and most happiest life possible. And now, hear I am, utterly lost because I lost the one person who cared for me the most. Who saw her success in mine, and was willing to do whatever it takes to see me happy, during my worst times. Now, my folks, on hearing this, have become super depressed, and are extremely apologetic for the pain that me and her went through. My mom , who's health was already bad, is now crying day in and day out about this. My dad is also super depressed.  Looking back, I wish I communicated more with her. But as they say, hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nAll in all, I lost my best friend. Now, I can't sleep or eat or work. I just don't know how to move on.",

    "content": "**\"Private India\":**\n\nAside from the ones speculated at already, I hear there will be another secret Avenger showing up for Infinity War - Private India.\n\n---\n\n***Bio:***\n\n  Born **Kyakar R. Hihai**, he isn't a high-ranked officer like Captain America,  but a basic soldier, a private, for the Indian Army.  One day while on site at a secret location in Kashmir, guarding a secret radioactive material along with his other regiment (his superiors wouldn't tell him what it was), he discovered in the dead of night some Pakistani spies attempting to make off with it - he bravely tried to fight them off, and killed a few, but the material ended up exploding and knocked him unconscious as well as two of the Pakistani spies, who were somehow rescued by other spies and never found by the Indian soldiers.  \n\nThose two Pakistanis ended up becoming some of his most notorious enemies on their own \u2013 Halal and Haram; as for him,  over the next few weeks he was specially quarantined by the Indian Army; his body began to change, he grew a bit stronger, and he could stomach his aunt's horrid samosas which he never liked before.  The Indian army wanted to keep tabs upon him, and being obedient, he agreed.  They found that the radioactive material had infused with his DNA- giving him extraordinary resilience and special powers; this, combined with the special Ayurvedic Chywamprash that he eats daily, gives his powers a uniquely Indian flavor, almost as if from the Holy Books themselves.  Far from fearing the worst, the army realized he could be used for special purposes.  They subsequently put him to use in their militaristic and spying drills, where he succeeded greatly.  His reknown eventually became known to the Avengers, who looked to recruit him.  \n\n-----\n\n***Powers:***\n\n**-Powerful neck muscles and enhanced inner-ear stability**, which allow him to bob his head sideways vigorously in the Indian affirmative fashion in order to more convincingly agree with people and his superiors.\n\n\n**-Skin-color changing ability:** The radioactive contaminant has mixed with the DNA/melanin in his skin and has given him the ability to control the hue of his skin\u2019s \u2018brownness.\u2019  In other words, he can make himself very, very brown- nearly to the point of blackness, or an extremely whitish-wheat color.  He very much prefers the whitish color (he has modeled for many Fair Boy skin color ads by using it), although the Indian sun often burns his skin cells in that state and he is forced into a more neutral brown.  The dark-brown/black he finds useful during night-time espionage, but otherwise he detests it.\n\n**-Very flexible spine:**  Years of yoga training has made his spine very supple and easily bending.  He can twist into the most uncomfortable poses with ease, making him an ideal spy, and willingly bows down to every superior who comes before him.  He is the ideal son, the boy Mothers dream of having.  He loves to follow orders- some say his spine is so flexible it is like he is spineless.\n\n**-Dust-attracting fingers:**  Related to his super-obedience, his fingers are genetically enhanced with the ability to attract dust-  but only off the lower regions/feet, and only from people who he deems are superior to him. \n\n\n**-Indomitable Nosiness:**  Although he can stop others from being nosy with his powerful stare, he himself is hypocritically and powerfully nosy.  His charming manner and quick wit allow others to divulge even secret information they normally wouldn't - aunties start revealing when THEY will start having grandchildren, and uncles reveal when THEY will lose weight, much to their displeasure.  \n\n**-Bhai the Spy:** In this vein, he has super hearing which allows him to secretly spy on the other Avengers and keep tabs on them.  He convinces them to let him listen on their discussions, for the sake of their own well-being and to preserve the integrity of the Avengers.  It is not spying or snooping in his eyes, he is just being a concerned brother.\n\n\n**-Super potent digestive juices/bowels:**  His natural Indian digestive system, which can withstand the heat from any spice, is amped up to an extreme level.  He can eat raw chili, gunpowder, and even the occasional hot lava.  He always does a special pooja for God Agni before doing this, however.   When he eats gunpowder, he can put any subsequent thing into his mouth and then shoot it out with bullet-like velocity. \n\n**-Iron self-control:** Due to practicing brahmacharya and retaining his semen, his skin secrets a beautiful lotus fragrance, and he becomes unfailingly attractive to women.  The irony is that is he is extremely socially awkward around them and manages to screw up most of his flirtations even before he starts.  So they brand him a pervert and try to get away- only for him to charge his throat chakra with a disdained cry, \u201cNahi!\u201d \u2013 which reverberates so powerfully in the air that it deafens and immobilizes them for several minutes.  Private India is forced to apologize and slinks away.\n\n\n**-Limited Flight:**  He can fly, but not quite as well or as high as Iron Man, and for not nearly as long a time.  So he has to be careful, and sometimes uses his Dhoti for parachute support.  Incidentally, whenever he flies, a distance that should take him no more than 15 minutes sometimes takes him a whole hour, due to unexpected turbulence and a curious influx of birds.  He marvels at the lack of air traffic control and complains to himself, but he accepts it ultimately.\n\n**-Supercharged chakras:** His intense pranayama and yoga training, combined with his radioactive DNA, have given him tremendous amounts of energy in his chakras.  This gives him a nearly-limitless amount of energy, which mysteriously seem to vanish when it comes to Avengers' administrative work. \n\n**-Powerful tardiness:** Shows up for meetings not just late, but SUPER late: no less than 4 hours, thank you very much.  \n\n**- Enhanced Coconut-oiled hair -** which he keeps covered by which his hooded mask, has the power to immobilize any enemy by its pungent smell.  He grows specially-enhanced super coconuts just for this purpose, which do not lose their pungent properties no matter how long they are left out in the sun.\n\n**-Hyderabadi Feariyani:**  His special meal, containing a fear-inducing chemical (an idea he \u2018borrowed\u2019 from Scarecrow) which he sometimes serves his opponents (which they accept due to his Indomitable hospitality) to induce fear in them and reveal their weaknesses.\n\n----\n\n**Costume:** True to Gandhi's ideals, he homespun his own costume - made of a reinforced bi-weave- cotton.  At the center of his chest is Mahatma Ghandi\u2019s chakra wheel of India; his mask/cowl, fitting snug over the upper half of his face, is made up of an Orange, White, and Green line running parallel atop each other, across it. His banion (undershirt) is bulletproof - although vulnerable to the annoyed yanks of his mother.  He occasionally wears a reinforced dhoti, which, if he were to fall from a great height, can expand and act as a parachute to break his fall. Unfortunately, it is prone to rips and he gets his servant to resew it often.\n----\n**Bhooth Bhais:**  True to the socially-conscious nature of his Indian society, he can temporarily create multiple copies of himself, called Bhooth Bhais - which are weaker than his real self and only last a few minutes.  \nWhenever he enters a bus or a train, any empty space is automatically filled up by his Bhooths.  Even if he is the lone passenger, within seconds his Bhooths automatically replicate and fill up and engulf the entire compartment - hanging out of windows, on the roof, etc.  This is due to P.I.'s subconscious mind which has, throughout his life, never had an experience of traveling on anything but a totally packed ride. \n\n**Special Powered Attack \u2013 Bhooth Baliye:  'The Item Number:'** In the middle of huge battle sequences, he can pause them mid-fight and breaks out into a cool song-and-dance number. The dance moves themselves act as fight moves and helps him defeat even the toughest enemies.  The intensity of the vibrations of all his selves dancing can create Bhooth-replicas of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol to join, who use their star-charisma to seduce the enemy should physical force not work, with Udit Narayan's voice mysteriously singing in the ether.\n\n----\n\n***Interesting Facts:***\n\n- He Is his own pre-fight astrologer.  Whenever he has a particularly tough enemy, he builds a specially crafted suit- made with the vedic metals and encrusted with the jewels that will protect him from the negative energies of the stars.\t\n\n\n- Makes his opponent wait, as he does a special pooja before his hard fights - invoking the Gods and applying paste on his opponents' foreheads.  As his fame has increased, he has even invited Baba Ramdev and other gurus to come and bless his fights.  Huge throngs of masses eventually came to watch as he would defeat his enemies.\n\n\n- Often chews betel leaf in his fights, which stains his teeth red and intentionally fools his opponents into thinking they have seriously hurt him.  He spits the juice in their eyes, which, due to his fiery digestive system and saliva, temporarily blinds and burns them.\n\n\n- He once out yoga'd Baba Ramdev, out-shouted Arnab Goswami, out-questioned Barkha Dutt, out-scolded Jaya Bachchan, and out...ed Karan Johar.\n\n\n- Captain America loves him, for he is unfailingly obedient. Hawkeye doesn't, because Private India hates hearing about him hitting the 'Bull's eye,' as he cannot stand to hear cows being harmed.\n\n\n- Believes that Shiva, Krishna, Ganesha, Hanuman, Ram, Durga, and Kali were the original Avengers, and that Muslim conquerers have sadly wiped this knowledge out of existence.\n\n\n- Whenever the Avengers\u2019 interdimensional fights end up nearly destroying entire cities, and they are called upon to clean it up afterwards, Private India almost always desists, and instead thinks it is not his business and that \u2018someone else can do it, na?\u2019 He personally doesn\u2019t mind the rubbish and thinks downed power-lines, torn-apart cars and scrap metal from burning building bring a \u2018hometown flavor.\u2019 \n\n\n- He can beat anyone in a staring contest.  Can turn the tables on nosy uncles and aunties by his piercing gaze so that they instantly turn away.  Has the special ability of making female enemies feel so nervous and uncomfortable that they instantly lose the will to fight and start quaking in awkwardness.  For the finishing blow he merely walks up to them and coyishly remarks, \"Bhabhi, how pretty you are looking, na?\" - to which they faint from embarassment.\n\n\n- Whenever the Avengers Assemble, he unfortunately only arrives weeks later and with a dismissive tone, stating that he 'only recently got the announcement,' and that 'he did everything he could but that is bureaucracy.\n\n\n- Sometimes, whenever he is just about to defeat his enemies with a finishing blow - they bribe him, and he lets them off the hook.  This is ineffective against attackers who happen to be Muslim or who transport cows, or who are Pakistani - he shows no mercy then.\n\n\n- Somehow knows the answer to everyone's problems, and when they try to disagree with him, he just answers that he is an Avenger and that they should know better than to question him.\n\n- Unflagging loyalty to his country.  Hates when people talk bad about it, even in jest.  Although he respects Captain America, he feels somehow slighted by him and holds him only at arms\u2019 length.\n\n- Whenever he crosses over into the DC Universe, he Is unfailingly condescending towards Batman, who he doesn't believe is a real superhero because he doesn't actually have any natural superpowers, he is only a regular human who worked hard enough to get where he is at.  He decries the Justice League for their 'affirmative action' in including a normal human among their ranks, and believes he must have had a special reservation to get there. \n\n\n- Believes that the 'A' on Captain America's helmet means he got an A grade on his training, so he respects him for it.  In the same vein, he scoffs at Superman for only getting an \"S.\"\n\n\n- Whenever Bruce Banner changes into the Incredible Hulk, he notes that his uncle used to do something similar, but who would then go and chase after the women in his area, whom he (interestingly) would never hear from again.\n\n\n- Is a sucker for foreign tech - After Iron Man upgraded his armor, he tried to get Stark to sell his unused tech- to no avail.  Besides, he didn't have the money for it.  So he quietly snuck out some of Stark\u2019s blueprints and got a friend to design a similar rip-off armor suit for him.  Unfortunately, it proved to not be reliable and he got many bullet-piercings and slipper-marks from angry aunties - though he occassionally can and does use the suit when needed. As he cannot be Iron Man, he has smartly called it \"Bronze Bhai.\"\n\n\n- Believes Scarlet Witch and Black Widow are the most supremely beautiful white goddesses that he has ever seen, and gazes at them lovingly whenever they are near.  He has created special temples for them in his home town and does a morning pooja for them every day.  On the other hand, he vehemently dislikes Gamora, who's strange dark green skin repulses him, and he sees her as subhuman.  He wonders how she can be a Guardian of the Galaxy, when she cannot be a Guardian of Her Dignity?  He only tolerates her because her green color reminds him of the Green on the Indian flag, but otherwise he can't stand to look at her.  He constantly asks Drax when she is going to be married off so she will be attending to her domestic duties and not bother them anymore.\n\n\n- Unfortunately, whenever he gets too close to either of the two beauties, his hand suddenly gains a power of its own and starts compulsively reaching out to touch or grab them. As the women understand he is inherently a nice guy, they are patient with him - but he has had many a finger broken by Black Widow who has to consistently remind him to stop. To which he remarks wittingly, 'it's okay- I am not a crorepathi, but a sore-pathy.'  He has asked Scarlet Witch so many times to show him her 'Bobs' that she had to call her neighbors, Bob Johnson and Robert Daniels, over to Private India's house.  At this, he was naievely convinced that she was indeed showing him her 'Bobs,' and he sighed exultingly at his good fortune.\n\n- In his appeal to convince the Avengers to let him join them, he made tremendous promises, and vowed to get the Avengers back on track to be the team he knew they could always be.  He convinced them that he was the hero they always needed, but did not know it.  Many of the other heroes, including most of the Guardians of the Galaxy, took a liking to him, and the Avengers themselves were smitten with his convincing logic and strong words \u2013 they accepted him.  But after a few years of being with them, they found themselves slightly disillusions.  He was late to fights and meetings, promised to attack certain enemies but never did, talked about the Glory of India despite sometimes even fighting in the middle of outer space light years away with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and would get his \u201cBhooth Bhais\u201d to sometimes forcibly silence his naysayers (like Gamora, who he treated like a lower caste and thus had a grudge against him).  So the Avengers plan to have a meeting next year to decide whether to let him stay or go \u2013 they are not sure, but he is hopeful and confident in his value and knows he will do a \u2018Super Hit\u2019 job.  The choice is uncertain, but his moment of truth is arriving soon\u2026.What do you think will happen?\n",

I'm just disgusted that\n\nYou would laugh at something like\n\nThat, and how does it look like a\n\nPrank, do you not see his face?\n\nAnd now you wanna watch the\n\nVideo\n\nI said I thought the blood was fake it\n\nDidn't look like nothing was wrong\n\nWith his face and it's not now I wanna\n\nWatch it it's that I unplugged my\n\nPhone checked our messages eat\n\nBreakfast then that's when I came\n\nBack to watch the video\n\nShe said I know that you thought the blood\n\nWas fake. That's why I said didn't\n\nYou see his face? Does he look like\n\nHe's pranking or joking?\n\nI said yes I saw his face but I still didn't\n\nKnow it looked like nothing\n\nWas wrong with his face and yes I\n\nDid see that he had a serious look\n\nOn his face\n\nHe didn't look like he's pranking or\n\nJoking\n\nShe said well it's nothing new, I always say\n\nWe are complete opposites. Not\n\nMany people watch more horror\n\nMovies than me.\n\nAnd as soon as I saw the post\n\nAnd what it said I was completely\n\nHorrified. I could see how serious it\n\nWas right away\n\nI said why are you saying we are\n\nComplete opposites? Yes\n\nI don't watch horror movies at all because I'm watching the\n\nIndian movies\n\nShe said I have been saying that since the\n\nVery beginning of our friendship\n\nI said but I'm asking why did you say it\n\nShe said why did I say that today? Or why do\n\nI always say it? I'm just speaking\n\nThe truth. We have very few things\n\nIn common, about ninety percent\n\nOf us is complete opposites\n\nI said you haven't said that in awhile and you're saying this like you're trying\n\nTo make me feel bad I don't\n\nNeed you to be talking to\n\nMe like that\n\nWhy did you say that today is what\n\nI meant\n\nShe said I'm not trying to make you feel bad and why would you ask such\n\nA ridiculous question? How is it\n\nNot obvious? You look at the pic\n\nAnd you think it's fake blood and\n\nIt's some kind of prank. I look at\n\nThe pic and I see how serious it\n\nIs. How's that not completely\n\nOpposite?\n\nI said because I didn't know if it was\n\nA prank just by looking at it face I don't see how that's\n\nCompletely opposite\n\nWhat do you want us to have in\n\nCommon?\n\nShe said if somebody sends you\n\nSomething. Why would you just\n\nAssume it's a prank without\n\nLooking at it? Do you read anything\n\nFunny in the caption?\n\nJust drop it leave the subject\n\nI said because I looked at it before I\n\nHad my breakfast so I didn't get a\n\nChance to click on it no I don't read\n\nAnything funny in the caption but\n\nThat doesn't mean it's not a prank\n\nShe said ok\n\nShe said when did I ever say that I care\n\nAbout anything in particular that\n\nWe have in common?\n\nThings that people have in\n\nCommon is supposed to come\n\nNatural. You can't fake it and you\n\nCan't force it\n\nShe said when did I ever say that I care\n\nAbout anything in particular that\n\nWe have in common?\n\nThings that people have in\n\nCommon is supposed to come\n\nNatural. You can't fake it and you\n\nCan't force it\n\nI said you never did but you be saying\n\nIt like we are supposed to have\n\nEvery thing in common or it's a bad\n\nThing that we don't have that much\n\nIn common I don't wanna keep\n\nHearing that sh\\*t\n\nMe and my grandma didn't even\n\nHave that much in common\n\nBecause I stopped talking to her\n\nShe said I have never said we have to have\n\nEverything in common. Nobody\n\nHas everything in common, I have\n\nAlways said. We are more opposite\n\nThan alike it's just a statement\n\nI said but still I don't wanna hear it\n\nShe said well, you are the one going on and\n\nOn and on. I said let's leave the\n\nSubject already. But you want to\n\nKeep talking about it\n\nI said do you understand can you\n\nRespect your son and stop saying\n\nIt?\n\nNo I thought you meant to get off\n\nOf the arcazecansee post thing you\n\nMeant that question too\n\nI meant the whole entire subject\n\nWe're talking about\n\nOk ok I'm leaving it\n\nIf I like certain artists certain video\n\nGames and some other things can\n\nI see them to you and you tell me if\n\nYou like them?\n\nShe lied and said there is no point in that, and I\n\nDon't have time for all that. I have\n\nWay too many things I'm working\n\nOn as it is she was telling me she won't make time for me I'm not worth her time & I'm not important enough for her to make time for when I always would watch the videos and movies she liked that I ended up liking and send her my thoughts and favorite parts on them because she asked me to do it\n\nI said that way you could see if we\n\nWould have more things in\n\nCommon like you say it is\n\nSupposed to come natural\n\nShe said it's not just about interests, it's\n\nAbout\n\nCommunication and how we\n\nPerceive things as well, this is\n\nWhat you call leaving the subject?\n\nAfter this I went 3 weeks without talking to her because me and her already had that talk of me telling her she is going to stop emotionally abusing me and holding grudges to mistreat me she said she was going to do it but went back on her word(now)\n\nMy birthday was 10 days later she sent a happy birthday picture but didn't say happy birthday and many many happy returns of the day like she usually says and she didn't post me on her story and put happy birthday like she did last year but she posted her friend on her story and put happy birthday for him(now)\n\nI made multiple posts posting her pictures roasting her telling her how ugly she is and what she looks like since she would be racist talk to me like I'm a slave and verbally abuse me(now)\n\nShe commented under the posts lied and said the only reason why she didn't make me a birthday story is because I was still ignoring her like she didn't agree to stop emotionally abusing me and then she told me I better delete it right now(now)\n\nShe said I didn't wish her a happy mother's day and she's glad I did because she's not my mother(now)\n\nShe said if I would've been texting her she would've been sending me reels but she said she didn't have time to bond with me(now)\n\nShe lied and said I didn't apologize after I apologized(now)\n\nShe said that I was mentally ill when I apologized for \"Emotionally abusing her\" to see how racist she is and to see if she would apologize and she said that I need help and she doesn't even think a psychiatrist can help me(now)\n\nShe didn't apologize admit she was wrong and take accountability for lying about she would not emotionally abuse me no more for saying there is no point in bonding with me and lying to me and saying she didn't have time to bond with me and lying about that she would post me on her story for my birthday and not wishing me a happy birthday(now)\n\nShe said I will be facing a lot of bad karma but didn't acknowledge she will be facing a lot of bad karma for emotionally abusing me, showing favoritism, refusing to take accountability, manipulating my feelings, and perpetuating the same toxic patterns I experienced with my own family.(now)\n\nShe said the trust is gone and our friendship will never be the same after I posted pictures of her ugly face and I was roasting her(now) I was posting tammi's pictures and telling her how ugly she is and roasting her on what she looks like and who she looks like seeing she emotionally abused me and verbally abused me because she was racist and because I was doing things that bother her",

    "content": "(Posting here since AITA removed my post, sorry if its too much to read just looking for opinions for this post)\n\nMental Sister.\n\nI (16f) and my sister (18-19) dont talk at all due to an incident that happened last year and due to her trying to steal all the parents attention (42m dad) (38f mum) from me and my two younger brothers (14) and (10). For some backstory my little brothers and me never got as much attention as my sister does even though she is older. She has issues where when she was born she was born with health difficulties. She seems to also love attention and does anything for it. She has tried to steal my ex boyfriend in the past and has hated when I get attention since I have a lot of mental health issues and have trauma along with scars. Everything that I have done or has happened to me always ended up having the question, \"are you doing this because your sister did this?\" From my parents as shes the oldest. I always had to act like the oldest and suffered from physical abuse from my parents, bullying and also SHed. My sister could never be hit or anything and anytime she screamed or cried the blame would be put on me and I would be beaten. She couldnt be hit or touched as she could bruise properly. I went through most of the childhood trauma since I had to act like the oldest, do chores, get beaten, look after my brothers, while my sister was babied as she went to sleep or spend money on another ugly man. But only recently did I realise how much she manipulated my parents into making them into some weird npcs. They do everything and act as if their on eggshells with her. She had me arrested last year and I havent talked to her since as I suffered from trauma due to how bad I was treated at the police station and put into a frozen cold cell with cuts on my wrists.\n\nAnyways I dont talk to her and after the situation I witnessed today I wish to not ever talk to her again. What I will say is only some of what things happened today. If I continue more cringe will come out in this story and its so weird and stupid how they acted today like some dramatic idiots. It was just weird Anyways continuing with the story, My sister is mental. She was getting mad and we was all downstairs, me, my mum, her boyfriend and my grandmother. I was high and she stood up while we was all on the couch and said \"fuck it im wrappung a joint\" like wtf we have friends coming over and ik this bitch only wanted to for attention, she stormed into the utility room which is like a washing area on the right side of the room and this is open plan so u could see her a little. Everyone was saying stuff like \" cmon simran dont have it now people are coming over\" she stood there in the fucking utility openly saying stuff u would say in ur mind like, \" should I have it now? I dont want to make anyone mad?\" \"laughs let me have one\" my mum said \"please dont simran\" I just sat there on the sofa, dying from cringe and wanted to k!ll myslf from the most cringe scene ever. I was gonna die of cringeyness. After a while this happened she didnt do it because the bitch doesnt know how to roll a joint and we was all back to sitting down. Shes a bit fat so she looks funny when she walks trying to have confidence in her walk which looks like a weird geeky disabled kid so its just funny and I die from cringe everytime.\n\nShe then does this thing where she runs from the garden or wherever she is where people can see her and runs to her room as if someones chasing her but the weird part abt it even tho its cringe when she does it and my parents act like npcs and follow her as if shes done something crazy which is nothing and they say \"Oh what has she done now? WHATS WRONG SIMRAN???\" I sit there thinking wtf is wrong with these npcs and laugh and then she comes back all mad since not enough attention was given to her, sits on the sofa near her geek boyfriend then she said \"my hand just touched some water and felt like it was burning\" I just sat there thinking what fucking dharman scene was that are we filming some kind of dramatic as fuck movie??? LIKE WTF HELP. I get told by family members apart from my siblings that have seen me go through this which them themselves have gone through and still get backlash from my family members which have included my mothers side and fathers side cousins apart from some. I get told most times I meet cousins, family friends of my parents to talk to my sister and get along with her and create a fake happy sister relationship which I do not want at all. All I wish is to have my own life without my sister in it and there so reason for her to be in it if I have just finished secondary school and she is likely to go college soon. I dont think of her as a sister either. Its unfair and hurts me. I dont even wish to talk to family members anymore knowing the question ' Can you get along with your sister for your mother please?' would be asked even if they havent heard the full story and only heard it form my mother who put me through most of the abuse in my childhood, called the cops on me as a child many times simply for not following her or listening to her since I suffered from ADHD and since she didnt care she would treat me like her 'step-daughter'.\n\nShe has changed and of course I must forgive her as I need to live using her money but theres no reason for me to talk or get along with my sister. The worse part about this is that my sister doesnt want to get along with me neither and makes up stories that I do bad stuff and always makes sure I never get my parents full attention. I never have and I never want their attention since the only time I get it some argument starts happening and I end up seeming like the 'devil child' since I ignore people when they dont listen to the words 'no' or 'stop' which my parents ignore a lot no matter how many times I ask them to they can never stop and pressure me until I get mad and shout at them then stay in my room as they lauigh and call me a brat. They know I suffer from ADHD yet sometimes they still do it at this age. I cant wait until im at least 20 to move out and live a better life away but that 4 years. I dont know if I can deal with being told to get along with my sister every time I try to have family time with my family and shes there.\n\nI dont care if she is there too its just that I always get told to make up with her and it hurts me bringing back the memories form last year along with the scars on my body from that month of full on depression. I didnt go to school much as I am the only girl in my year and go to private school and also dealt with the boys at my school who ignored me and treated me like nothing every day so I had no friends. Only after the whole drama happened did I fully make friends and became popular and have a big friend group. And that month was when I was supposed to be more confident as I had a boyfriend and lots of friends. My parents dont understand that everything was taken from me that month including my 2 years relationship with my boyfriend which was online then we met in real life and was supposed to be meeting again. I broke up with him after the police incident since the trauma was so bad that I had butterfly stitches most of the month. It should have been stitches but the uk uses butterfly stitches unless ur whole arm if falling off. I have dealt with too many issues with my sister and just want this to stop.

    "content": "Before you read this-I posted this on 2 reddits and didnt get any reactions and now since its over and closed story I want your opinion, the read will take you probably 7 minutes. Sorry for mistakes, english is my second language.  \n  \nTLDR-She broke up with me I wanted her back, she was giving me mixed signals, I think that now I am free.\n\n  \n\n\nOkay so I dont even know how long is this gonna be, but I am gonna treat it as my personal journal, no one might see it, I dont really care. Btw english is my second language so there might be some mistakes so ignore them.\n\nWe met at ice cream parlor, (both 20 years old, ironically she is 6 hours older than me) we are both bikers so we met on bikes, we did little chit chat and she eventually asked me for Insta, I gave it to her, she was in realeationship at the time, but I didnt see her as my future GF nor my ex. So we eventually became good friends, I helped her with her mental issues and more. Eventually we started goin on rides together slowly meeting eachother and kind of flirting ig. :D Well the funny part is that we made out at gas station at 3:00 AM, next day she broke up with her boyfriend and day after that we had our first sex. On 9.6.2024 we made it official. We have been together for 1 year and 4 months. 2 months before our breakup, she started going to Archery and obv she met a lot of new people, mostly guys. I am not very jealous but since she is so much out of my league I was scared. She was very often talking about this guy, Imma call him Martin, she said he is not her type, but he is tall and muscular, which both i am not.\n\nBefore the breakup like 1 week I felt something was off so I texted her something like \"Hey are we all right\" and she typed \"Yeah we are all good\" but I still felt something was off. So we went on after few days she texted me \"we need to talk\" and oh boy, you know how that felt. So I said alright lets talk, at first she didnt want to talk via call but I convinced her. She told me that I apply way to much presure on her and that I just love her way to much, which is weird for me. I said to her that \"Okay, I am sorry I made you feel that way, Imma try to change it\" later she admited that she wanted to breakup with me immidieatly via call but I convinced her not to.\n\nAgain few days later I was invited to go with her family to theatre, when I arrived we had a little talk, and she told me that We have to breakup. I broke down in tears. Eventually we had to go so I was mad, broken and absolutelly disgusted. I became cold, after the theatre we had planned dinner with her parents. I absolutelly love them and we have great relationship. So the day went on after coming to her home we had planned that I will sleep at her place beacuse we were goin to work the next day (We work at the same place). The night was weird, we slept in same bed and we were just holding hands like some kids, eventually we talked once again and ended up cuddling the whole night. Next day at work we were exchanging looks into eachothers eyes and it felt very good. After work when were goin to car, she said \"I am so stupid\" and she said that we could turn that just into pause not end. She also wanted some space, so I tried. But giving someone space, after 1,25 year of texting everyday, knowing when she goes to the bathroom it was hard as fu\\*k.\n\nWe became cold, not texting much and then the day came. 9.10.2025 my girlfriend broke up with me with words that she doesnt feel it the same and that love isnt always enough. Which tbh absolutelly broke me. I didnt see any signs, 3 weeks before breakup we were on motorcycle trip. We went sighseeing and rode some curvy rodes which I love. She loves churchs, castles etc. she even admited that she enjoyed it a lot. 1 month before breakup she even painted me a painting writing on the backside \"together forever\".\n\n19.10.2025-There is some recent update I was at hers house on 18.10. and I was there just to fix my car with her dad, and we talked, alot, I asked her if she has replaced me to which she answered no. Then I asked one more question \"Did you have sex with anyone?\" She replied yes. My entire world shattered, guess who was it Martin, yeah that guy she told me not to worry about. She said that she was mentally sick. She even said that she didnt enjoy it as much as with me. But hey we were already broken up. When leaving I asked her \"Hey can I say it?\" She said go ahead. I said to her that I love her, she said \"I love you too\". That was the worst ride home I cried the entire time.\n\nAnd now comes my problem, what do I do, I want her back so much. I am tired of \"no contact type shit\" I dont wanna hide that I still love her. I wanna show her. After breakup I started goin to gym so I am working on myself currently, I even took some extra shifts at work. But every minute at work, the only thing I think about is HER. I am tired of people telling me to move on, I just cant, she said we can still be friends, and I wanna be friends with her just to get her back. What do I do? I feel like we are both kids just trying to love eachother. What hurts me most and probably will in the future is that some random guy touched my little princess on places where I was. If I wasnt skinny small guy I would beat the shit out of him.\n\nAs I said I dont care if anyone reads this, I just wanna talk to someone since I have none.\n\nThere is something I forgot to write but it seems pretty important. We were always saying to each other that we are gonna last forever. I even read old messages from time to time. We had pretty good time overall. But one of her worse traits is that she always sees the bad things instead of the good. Also as I said earlier I have best releationship with her parents, hers dad treats me as his son and hers mom is the most sweetest woman I know.\n\nOk so update, yesterday she send me a reel about me being the best boy she ever met, and her being horible person. Before I start paraphrasing what we said, I think I feel into her trap. I probably shouldnt answer to that reel. Basically I answered to her that she is not terrible person, and that I will never forget her. To which se replied \"I dont think Ill ever get over you\" I told her that I always think of the memories we have together and she said she doesnt, she just cant put me down on friend from boyfriend. I asked her if she thinks about me and she said yes. Then she said one sentence that made me almost cry \"I have a feeling as if I wanted to press restart\". Sadly she meant it to go back when we met and say to eachother what we want. I always thought that we wanted the same thing, live a peacefull life with kids and house. I told her that we wanted same thing to which she said \"we had pretty similiar idea\". Then I asked her why we broke up to make sure and finally find the answer. She said \"I just didnt feel it, I wanted something else from partner\" That broke me, once again :D. Then I told her that releationship should be about finding solutions and other bs. She agreed and I asked her then why we broke up. She said because we tried to find solution but we did it wrong.\n\nAfter that it went away and more into non-relationship talk. She said that she likes my ig story and I asked her if she would go for a ride with me. To which she said she has archery lessons. Then we chatted a bit and I said \"Last few days I just wish to sit with you and just TALK\" to which she said \"Maybe in some future time\" after that nothing important happend I just said that I am here for her and that I am not her enemy I am the opposite. To which she said she is here for me too.\n\n25.10.2025-okay guys another update to my journal. I was getting okay, I didnt think of her that much. Today she send me video of she passing by the gasstation we make out. Now few hours later, I am in tears, I miss her so much. I thought I am okay, and just this simple video brought back so many memories. The worst think is that I will see her tommorow, so expect update, its gonna be hard to play cold guy, I dont know if I can make it. I will probably try to ask about Martin because thats what hurts me the most.\n\n26.10.2025-Okay I just came back from work, it was weird. We barelly talked. The only time we talked was when I came late to work and had to call her to open the door for me bcs she is the only one who I have contact on at work. When she opened the door, she noticed that I have her hoodie which is from her brother, its something like merch of his job and I really like that hoodie. She said that her brother wants it back and if I dont give it to her he will come for it itself. So when work ended we were both at the parking lot I opened her door and threw it on the seat and I said somethink like \"I recommend washing it\". Thats the only thing we said to eachother we didnt even go to lunch together or breaks which we did all the time. Now I came home and got message from her saying \"I am sorry if I made you mad, I dont know how to act\" and now I need your help what to text, if I should go cold or not, if I should even reply. I will probably update today if I think of something to text her.\n\n27.10.2025-Alright we exchanged few texts nothing serious I replied to her that \"Dont be sorry, it just hurt me more than you think\" She said \"Can I talk to you normally? I mean like at work? I didnt know if I can talk with you cause you looked cross\" I said \"Yeah we can, but I think you saw that its not easy for me, we can just be colleagues, there is nothing more I can be to you\" She replied with \"Okay collegue\" and thats all. So I think I stayed calm and didnt overreact and I think I did pretty well. Dont know when I am gonna see her again probably again in work in few days. Will update if something interesting happens. Bye for now.\n\n31.10.2025-Rough day today, we were both at work she came later on hers shift she came at 11:00 AM. The weird thing is that we didnt talk, didnt connect eyes, nothing, pure nothing. The closest we were was probably 3 meters from each other. When she came she looked absolutelly georgous she is so pretty. It hurts me now so much bcs of what I lost, maybe I really was the problem. Maybe I was the reason we broke up, maybe its my bad. I dont know if it is better that we didnt talk or if it would be worse if we actually talked. We will be both at work on sunday so that will be another rough day. It was basically like on 26.10 but this time no message, nothing. Iam gonna hit gym today and I think I am gonna absolutelly destroy myself.\n\n4.11.2025-nothing important happend, I just went to our old messages and searched word \"Never\" and I saw messages from her that she would never leave me and if we ever break up it would be me but I saw an older voice message from her, I hit play. Not gonna lie I cried but on the other hand yesterday at gym I noticed new vein on my shoulder and that made me actually laugh and smile like a child.\n\n8.11.2025- probably last update, yesterday at work I was scrolling on tiktok I got her profile suggested as you might know because she is in my contacts, I wanted to press \"Dont show again\" but I miss clicked and I clicked on her profile, even tho I didnt want to I checked her reposts, and there were many that I didnt see- most of them were about being single is the best feeling etc. but one that hurt me more than 100 knifes, \"As my final act of love, Ill fuck the guy I told you not to worry about\" not gonna lie that was absolutely wrecking for me, but I mean I dont care, today I checked her profile on ig and she stopped following me and removed me from her followers so I guess I am free now, Ill still be seeing her at work but I think I dont care. Next week I am gonna get new tattoo, she always said that it would be sexy on me. Well I think so too. So imma be sexy without her. As I said I dont expect her coming back nor I care. So this is probably last update, if something interesting happens which i doubt, i will uptade but consider this story closed. Thank you guys for being my personal journal. Maybe few years later, ill come back to this post and think to myself how stupid I was.",

    "content": "Okay, so this is a long one, I apologise, but I'll be as concise as possible.\n\nI will not be including a TLDR because I feel all of this is important.\n\n**Some Background Context**\n\nMy mum hasn\u2019t had an easy life. At age 2 she had a severe accident that nearly killed her and left her with a visibly disfigured leg. For most of her life she could still walk, drive, even run \u2014 but as she got older, it started impairing her mobility.\n\nHer dad died when she was very young. She had a turbulent relationship with her mother growing up in the 60s and 70s, and she\u2019s had a rough past with her five siblings. She only speaks to her brother and youngest sister now (one other sister she was close with died a few years ago).\n\nHer first marriage ended in her early 20s after losing her firstborn in the first week of life. Then when she met my dad a few years later, to whom she had my older brother and me, that marriage eventually failed after 20-something years, and she was more or less a single parent raising me.  \nShe hasn't had a partner since, in any form.\n\nShe\u2019s never been a popular person \u2014 she\u2019s always been polarising and most people drift away from her once they've got to know her. She has just one friend, who lives in Wales, so the friendship is only through FaceTime as we're based in the North of England.\n\nDuring my childhood and teens, she was extremely independent and asked little of anyone. She argued with my dad alot, but that faded as he pulled back, only staying in touch with me.  \nI\u2019ve always seen him regularly throughout my life despite their separation.\n\n**Decline in Health**\n\nDuring COVID, her leg started giving her serious problems and she developed a limp. By 2022 (my final undergrad year), she was diagnosed with melanoma in her knee, which spread to the bone. She needed an amputation and is now permanently wheelchair-bound, with no chance of a prosthetic due to her unique case.\n\nShe\u2019s gained a massive amount of weight, is morbidly obese, and severely depressed. Obviously, I can understand why.\n\n**Life Today**\n\nShe lives downstairs in our council-rented home. The once independent woman I knew now depends heavily on me, and as bad as I feel to say this, I cannot stand it.\n\nShe's absolutely insufferable, filled with hatred for the world and everyone in it, including me most days, she's as dense as a rock, and I honestly just find her utterly repulsive. I genuinely cannot stand being around her. I hate talking to her. She starts arguments out of nowhere for the smallest reasons, and even when I try not to engage, she uses that as ammunition against me or just gets more heated because I won't take her bait.  \nIf she takes off on me about something and she's proven wrong, she'll just shut off and tell me to leave her alone before accusing me of 'abuse' because I want to seek a resolution to said dispute after proving her wrong.\n\nShe\u2019s controlling, toxic, and constantly slates every person she knows behind their backs \u2014 while simultaneously raging about how her eldest sister slanders her (despite not speaking for 10 years).\n\nMy older brother, who is 12 years older than me, is very successful, like millionaire succesful.  \nHe ran away when he was 16 years old to pursue his life, and has very little to do with her.  \nHe visits only at Christmas with his wife and kids. I see him sometimes throughout the year.\n\n**My Situation**\n\nI\u2019ve lived with my mum since graduating in 2022. I\u2019m turning 29 this November. (Yes, I graduated at 25, I was a late bloomer.)\n\nI have a First-Class Bachelor\u2019s and a Master\u2019s. I\u2019m proud of that, but not much else lately. I feel hopelessly lost. After I graduated, I had a job for about 9 months, but my team and I were let go, and since then, I\u2019ve spiralled:\n\n* I'm mentally drained, depressed, and gaining weight.\n* I have zero motivation to do anything beyond gaming with my girlfriend and friends.\n* I have a flipped sleep schedule: awake until around 7am, and up at 4pm on average.\n\nEven when I go out with friends and/or my girlfriend I get 3 or 4 phone calls asking when I'll be home or if i can 'do a favour' for her while I'm out.  \nMy friends think I'm fine - except for my unemployment, I don't like to burden them with my issues.  \nBut my girlfriend obviously knows first-hand the truth of the situation.\n\nOne of my cousins got married in June, my mum obviously knew, and on the day of the wedding, I woke up to her manically screaming downstairs. I'd never heard anything like it from her or anyone in my life. Me and my girlfriend woke up in a panic, thinking she was literally being murdered or something terrible had happened. When I say screaming, I mean literal, non-verbal, manic screaming. I sprinted downstairs to her and tried to calm her down and she wasn't responding to me, she was just looking at the wall, screaming and violently shaking her head side to side and bouncing up and down in her wheelchair like a toddler.\n\nThis was because her hospital transport failed to pick her up due to a communication error, causing her to miss an appointment.\n\nI was late for my cousin's wedding and missed the ceremony. He was understanding.\n\nI've dragged my girlfriend into this hellhole of a life and routine, as she came to live here with me for a while, as she herself has just finished her own degree.  \nThankfully, (for her sake) she\u2019s moving back home at the end of the month.\n\nFrom the moment I wake up, I'm being heckled by my mum; if I'm unavailable, she calls for my girlfriend instead.  \nIf I refuse (to encourage her independence), she asks my girlfriend, who feels too awkward to say no.  \nSo I'll then obviously do whatever it is my mum wants.\n\nAs screwed as it sounds, I'm so happy my GF is leaving soon, so she'll not have to put up with this.\n\n**Where I'm at**\n\nI have passions, dreams and goals I want to accomplish.\nI want to move and build a new life for myself in the US with one of my closest friends, and live my life with my girl. \nI'm hungry for success in my field and life, and I want my own business. \nBut whenever I sit at my desk to do anything, it's only a matter of time before I'll get bugged to do something, or she'll call me to either try to start an argument or rant to me about someone that's pissed her off, and any fleeting motivation I had to apply myself instantly vanishes.\n\nI feel I do my fair share for my mum, I shop for her, do some cleaning for her, dispose of her waste because she has no access to a toilet, random chores she needs. It might not seem like a lot, but I'm condensing immensely.\n\nShe could easily take up my entire day if I allowed it, but I try not to, which is what also causes a lot of friction, yet it's not enough.  \nShe'll still cause arguments, tell me I'm useless, tell me how much she despises me, and even criticises my (and my girlfriend\u2019s) style (we\u2019re alt).\n\nNothing I do is good enough.\n\nThis week I got myself a part-time job, thanks to the genorosity of my cousin's boyfriend.  \nHe offered it to me as a vessel to get myself into a normal routine again, and she's called me tonight to express her discontent with this job.  \nI had to sit through two 20-minute phone calls listening to her ramble about how my cousin is selfish and using me. She admitted she can\u2019t\u00a0*make*\u00a0me quit, so she tried to blackmail me by threatening to badmouth me. She\u2019s done this before, so I brush it off, but it\u2019s still exhausting.\n\nI'm still taking the damn job.\n\nEarlier this year, she accused me of \u201cmental abuse,\u201d shouting, and controlling her money, none of which is true. My girlfriend\u2019s witnessed 90% of these fights and knows I don\u2019t. My mum literally gives me her debit card to shop for her. I\u2019ve never spent a penny without her consent.\n\nShe has hospital-arranged transport that takes her to her recurring medical appointments because of her size, and she once told one of the drivers that I was abusing her because I wasn't feeding her or providing her with food in the home, which led to a police safeguarding visit. She wasn't expecting it, and she completely backpeddled when they came asking questions. The police inspected the kitchen to find fully stocked cupboards and fridge, and they left.  \nOne of the officers even made a comment saying, \"You have more food than me!\".\n\n**WHAT THE HELL DO I DO HERE**\n\nI could go on, but I feel what I've written illustrates my situation enough to garner appropriate advice.\n\nI feel trapped, and I'm miserable. I don\u2019t have the income to move out. I\u2019ve got some savings from a past graduate job, but not much. I absolutely loathe my mother; she's like this dark cloud that's just constantly lingering over my head.  \nI'm stressed beyond belief to the point I've now got alopecia in my beard and hair, just small spots, but still. But yet I still love her, and don't want to burn bridges with her.\n\nBut I know if I even manage to save enough money or gain a stable enough income to leave, and do so, she'll hate me and likely cut ties with me.\n\nI don't want that.\n\nWhat the hell do I do?",

    "content": "Hey guys, I want to share my story.\n\nI was working out in the gym one day when a beautiful girl came up to me and asked about the workout I was doing. We started talking, and within a couple of days, we became friends and decided to work out together. From then on, we trained side by side, helping and motivating each other.\n\nAfter some days, she told me she was planning to change her gym. That made me sad. But later, she said the only reason she would want to return was because of me\u2014and eventually, she did come back. I was really happy knowing I was the reason. Slowly, I started developing feelings\u2014not love, but a strong attachment\u2014since she was my first female friend this close.\n\nOne day, she suggested we go see the sunrise at the beach. I picked her up early in the morning, and we watched the sunrise together, followed by breakfast at a nice restaurant. It felt like my first real date, and I was so happy she trusted me enough to feel safe with me.\n\nShe\u2019s a small Instagram content creator, mostly doing food vlogs. One day, she asked me to come along for a shoot and be her cameraman. I was so happy she chose me. We rode together on my bike, I helped with her videos, and afterward, we\u2019d eat together. That became a routine.\n\nShe even invited me to her home once to help with an online test, where I met her parents. She introduced me to them as her younger brother (I\u2019m just 8 months younger than her). I gained their trust and started becoming like family to them.\n\nOver time, we began exploring new caf\u00e9s and restaurants together every week. She always insisted on paying the bill, which made me feel guilty sometimes, so I\u2019d buy her chocolates as a small gesture. She also helped me with physiotherapy sessions whenever I needed. At this point, I really thought I had found a true, close friend.\n\nOnce, when her family faced a tough situation, I helped them, and that made our bond even stronger. Her family trusted me more, and she became very close to me. On my birthday, she was the first person to wish me at midnight and even bought me branded gym clothes. That was the first time in my life I felt so valued.\n\nBut then, she had to move to Hyderabad for work. She promised to stay in touch through texts and video calls, but over time, she started to grow distant. She no longer texted me first, and I began to feel I wasn\u2019t a priority anymore. I admit I acted immaturely, sending childish messages because I didn\u2019t know how to handle the change.\n\nWhen she came back to town, I was overjoyed. I even bought her protein chocolates. But just two days later, I had an accident and fractured my ankle. I thought she would come visit me, but she didn\u2019t. That really hurt me.\n\nOn her birthday, despite being bedridden, I still tried to make it special. I edited a video for her with a love song in the background, but she got angry and asked me to change the song because she didn\u2019t want people thinking we were in love. I quickly changed it, but it left me feeling hurt. Since I couldn\u2019t buy her a gift, I built a website for her, sharing our memories and writing how happy I was to have her as a friend. She thanked me warmly, calling me her brother and saying she usually only tells that to her real brother. Her words touched me.\n\nStill, she never came to see me even after that. One day, when I asked where she was, she simply said she was traveling back to Hyderabad without telling me beforehand. I felt broken. I begged her to meet me before leaving, but she refused. When I asked why she was ignoring me, she directly questioned if I was in love with her.\n\nI said no, though I admitted I had feelings in the beginning. She got angry and said I had cheated her trust\u2014that she saw me as a brother while I secretly had other feelings. She felt betrayed, because she had welcomed me into her house and family as a brother . That broke me inside. She said from then on, we wouldn\u2019t go out to caf\u00e9s like before.\n\nI apologized and tried to explain that my care and efforts were genuine, not because of love, but because I truly valued her as my closest friend. She told me to drop the topic, so I did. But since then, she has completely avoided me. She sees my posts and stories, but never replies\u2014even when I shared that I lost my job. She doesn\u2019t ask about my about it either and my fractured ankle either.\n\nNow I feel completely heartbroken. She was the only person I used to talk to every day, share everything with, and now she\u2019s gone cold. I can\u2019t sleep at night because I keep thinking of her.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Should I ask her for forgiveness again, or should I just let her go? I\u2019m confused, hurt, and feel like I\u2019ve lost the most important person in my life. Please help me.",

    "content": "I am mentally in a bad place, but I think it is because I feel lost in life. No idea what to do next, but if I don't do something I will go crazy.\n\nI am pessimistic about the future, every day and night I just think anxious thoughts and I cannot get out of my head. I feel like if I don't change nothing good waits for me in the long term future. I feel like in theory I could do a 1000 things in 100 different directions, yet nothing really comes forward in my mind. I am stuck on various fronts and just stew in negativity.\n\nI am 32, f, born and living in Eastern Europe. I have nothing figured out yet. \n\nI worry about AI and the future, will we have jobs? I don't like or hate my profession, but it is well paying and the only thing I know to do. But there are efforts to reduce it with AI, I guess they will happen.  Also our company regularly doing layoffs twice a year since few years back. I am thinking about changing it, but this will not help in long term. I don't think i would be able to do this job until I am old (even if it exists then). I feel like I need to change, but no idea what to. How to choose? And in love life - i have none. If I don't change here also, I will be alone forever. I am ok being alone now, but in the long term future? \n\nI never have had a relationship in my life, never done intimate things with anyone. For 32 years I can count on the fingers of my one hand the men that have been interested in me (and that is after getting to know me, not on first sight definitely hahah). I am an ugly lady and this is he single worst thing you could be as a woman. I am not feeling down about it, it is just the facts and it quite helps explain the lack of relationships. Add to that I have social anxiety (which is better now, but growing up I was so closed off and afraid). Add to that the fact, even when I was teenager I accepted deep inside me that no one would want me (so there is no need to fret about it) and I kind of just did everything else in life besides the romantic part (like this is a book I never opened). Either that or I am somewhere on the asexsual spectrum. But everyone was looking hard for relationship always, and I just never did. Not sure if I don't have the desire, or that it is very repressed desire, or the fear is bigger that the desire. I am also overweigh, but the ugliness is due to facial features, even if I lose it  I still would be ugly haha. When I was younger and slimmer I still was not attracting anyone. But everyone around me is seriously coupled up, with kids, etc, has no/little time for me. So I acutely feel alone. My parents and relatives are visibly getting older, grandparents already died. And I am thinking I don't want to be old and alone. And I want to share life with someone. Not sure what to do here, I am big time behind. Not sure if I even will like it. Not sure even if I search super super hard I would ever find anyone (and we both like each other). So far I haven't met such person in my life. Not sure if I even want kids, never liked them, but I have very little time if I want to have them. This is such a big part of life, and I haven't even touched it yet. Not sure what to do here. Not sure what I even want. \n\nI am living for a first time on my own since 2 months ago, before that I lived in my parents apartment with my brother (parents were at village). 32  years to move out for first time. Culture here is different, this is another long story. But I ended up somehow with all the responsibilities of living alone long time ago without the benefits of freedom and choice. I paid bills, cleaned, did laundry, shopped, did apartment improvements and maintenance,  feeded myself etc long time ago, I was even supporting my brother and giving finantial aid to parents, but I didn't live on my own. So now for fist time I am living on my own (which is good). But maybe I am too late? Maybe this also contributes to my existential anxiety.   \nAnd I moved out when I bought a small apartment for myself (well, I took out mortgage). And    last year I burned myself out while fixing it, it is not fully ok yet but livable. But now I know I have debt to pay off, so the job situation is bonus worrisome. I have spend most of my savings on this, but at the same time the job market turned bad. Note, that I still have savings to last me few months if it goes bad, I am trying to be reasonable with money. It is something I really wanted and needed, but now I am more miserable than happy. The job situation, the renovation itself, idk, everting, it kind of burned me out. \n\nThen there is the general existential dread. My grandmother died last year and she was very close to me. Since then I feel really like life ends at some point and should not sit and wait for time to pass.\n\nI feel like I would be so calm and happy if I have figured out he basics of life  - like having (wanting) a partner, having (do I want it?) a kid, what job to do, where to live? But time is passing and I am nowhere. And I find the future dark and depressing, AI, automation, job loss, etc, being old and alone. And I am constantly stuck on those thoughts, constantly, I cant even sleep. I know it is not sustainable or productive, I just cannot stop myself.  \n",

    "content": "End of a wild relationship that has taken a toll on me, needed to get this all down, would welcome some replies to ease my mind. Take care all :)\n\nI (32M) broke up with my (36F) ex around 6 months ago and I am still struggling with the anxiety associated with the trauma associated with the relationship - we were together and very much in love for around 12 months, things moved super fast and I ignored a lot of red flags. We played the silly stay in contact game and tried to work things out but I knew it was done deep down after the last event that occurred. It's been over two weeks with no contact now. I'm still anxious about all that happened, ultimately to me but also that I ignored so much behaviour that is against my values.  \nI, according to her words during and post break-up was everything she ever wanted, loving, supportive, financially stable, healthy sex life, wanted to get married and have kids, no substance issues, own a home - genuinely cared for her daily (and I can honestly say this is all true on my behalf). I put everything I had into making her feel loved and safe - given her problem past relationships which were ultimately abusive.\n\nSome back story below:\n\n- Her family is very, very religious (cult like christianity) she attended the church for 2 years post serious drug use (meth) and by the pressure of her mum, brother and sister. But left to be with me. I am not religious at all.\n\n- She was addicted to prescription medication, dexamphetamine, she sought these out because she wanted them when she was younger (told to her by me) has been for 15 years was using upwards of 10 per day, everyday (50+mg). I completely overlooked this, this was a serious drug addiction which I failed many times to help her shake. She would eventually become angry any time I brought it up and there was always reasons why it \"can't be this week\" \"I can't start today\" \"ill start next week after such and such\".\n\n- Became angry when drinking lots of alcohol, this increased as the drinking regularity increased.\n\n- Really poor sleep because of the drugs, bed late, sleep all day.\n\n- She was also the main character in all her problems. Everything/everyone seemed to be pushing against her winning in life.\n\n- She told me she needed me to be okay, emotionally manipulative to the point that after the breakup would talk about wanting to die and how she now had nothing etc.\n\nWhat caused our breakup:\n\nWe were away in Vietnam, out drinking and having a good time - she all of a sudden became angry and antagonistic, this would happen after too many combined with the dexamphetamine use. I knew I had to get her home/back to the hotel. The taxi ride back was insane, she was yelling and screaming wanting to get out for no reason, the taxi driver knew there was something up and kept driving to take us to a safer location. I was trying to calm her down and was no where near her level of intoxicated.\n\n*Precursory I had never, will never and have never displayed violence towards a partner, this is a NO NO.*\n\nWe were nearing the hotel and I was facing forwards in the taxi - she had calmed slightly at this point. Then she leant her back into the door of the taxi and push kicked me in the face, heel to jaw, one of the hardest I've ever been hit (for background I have extensive Muay Thai training experience, including hard sparring - I'm also not a small guy 6'0 and 80kg) - I had concussion symptoms the next day. I told her what she'd just done and managed to calm her slightly and get her back to our bungalow when she then furthered her outburst (I filmed a lot of it because I was worried she would hurt herself and I would be blamed, she's a lot smaller than me). She threw a chair into the ocean, threw bottles around, threw a kettle at me, trashed our room and was yelling and abusing me at the top of her lungs. We had to fly out in the morning.\n\nPost this event I wanted to try and make it work, drug use increased (upwards of 50mg of dexamphetamine per day - according to her - she had gotten a full month in front of her prescribed allowance), drinking increased - I stopped drinking and tried to get her to stop, to no avail. While I was asleep, she then decided a couple of weeks post assault in Vietnam, while drunk, to reconnect with a person (female) from her past who was a drug dealer, been to jail who had gotten my ex into heavy meth use on multiple occasions from the ages of 20-31. I realised this in the morning and confronted her - this was something we touched on early on and I said I'm not okay with these kinds of people being involved in our lives. I told her again, this is your last chance. If you do something like this again I am going to have to leave. She promised it was a mistake, begged me and begged me. She agreed with everything I had said - I was so broken at this point that the person I love could do these things to me.\n\nA few weeks go by and we are in the process of moving in together (I know). The final night of the move I went to bed around 10pm she was drinking heavily. I wake up at 5am to start the final pack and move to my place. She's no where to be seen. I knew.. I called and and her was at this persons (females) house. I am not sure if she used drugs but she drunk drove there and left me in the middle of the night. It broke me. I ended things with her that night and moved all her stuff back to hers. She begged and begged for another chance. I knew it was done the betrayal was immense coupled with the assault a few weeks prior.\n\nA couple of months of me being silly and trying to work things out with a bit of distance finally ended a week after I said no more with her rolling up to my house, shit faced (drink driving again) telling me she has nothing and wants to die, waving a kitchen knife around and baulking at slashing at her wrists. This was another crazy event that I think about a lot.\n\nIt was a crazy year. I just needed to type this out and make myself see it for what it is. I am not perfect but I was a loving genuine partner who would have done anything for her. She knew this which I know will cause her more pain than it will me. But wow, I cannot believe I went through a lot of this. I can't believe I ignored the early signs.\n\nWould welcome some replies to comfort my mind.. thank you\n\nTD;LR - Just got out of a wild, abusive relationship with someone whom I loved very much hurting and betraying me because of drugs and alcohol. Just wanted to get this out in words to help my healing.",

    "content": "She is a girl from my classes. Due to the pandemic we had never met for about a year but then when the offline thing happened, we met. I was a bit shy and tried to sit away from(because she's so fucking beautiful and I didn't want to come off as a creep). But eventually in like a month or so. I started sitting behind her seat and slowly but surely started talking to her.\n\nI'm a class clown and I used to crack jokes. And the whole class would sometimes crack up. But sometimes not everyone would get it but she would. I asked her how and she said she watched a lot of memes too. I was taken aback and i told her that she had a lot of knowledge of memes. She smiled. \n\nThen one day after the classes i went downstairs to wait for my friend. She was there , i didn't want to go up to her or else it would have been too obvious. But i could not control myself by here cute self. I went up to her and asked what she was doing downstairs. She was waiting for someone too. The next day, after classes, when i proceeded to go down she told me to wait as it was hot downstairs,and me being the absolute dumbass, i sat next to her but left a lot of space between us. She didn't mind. \n\nOne day i was eating lunch and she took some pills. I asked what for, and she straight up said with no hesitation that they were for cramps.\n(I understood that those were for periods).\nBut i got a bit uncomfortable with the topic as no girl had ever been so open with me. \n\nBut i decided to shut up and continue playing chess. She took interest in that. She asked to play. Obviously i said yes. I asked her to download the game. She was hesitant and instead turned back 180 from her seat and was facing me and told me to play on my phone. Her legs were in between my legs and i just wanted to not touch them or else it would make her uncomfortable.After a few days , i say next to her as there were no seats available and i arrived late. She wanted to compare hands and started comparing. My palm was on hers. I was blushing but somehow controlled myself. Then she compared our heights. Then a few days later she compared hands again.\n\nA few weeks later. She mentioned her Instagram. I asked for it and she gave it to me. I just followed her and she followed back . I never sent a text. But after a few days . She decided to text me . She sent a relatable meme. I was very happy and got butterflies. Then we talked for a bit.I asked her about her performance in the exam , she said it was poor. I asked why. She again replies, periods , now at this point I'm genuinely confused. Why would anyone like me, why would she tell me that. Why. I'm too ugly anyways. No one could like me.\n\n Then she told me she was going to watch a movie with a guy from our classes. My heart sank. I tried to not show that in my texts and continued being happy. \n\nThen we kept talking. Again a few days later she told me that she was approached by a completely different guy from classes(i was like , why are you telling me this , I'm literally no one to you).i convinced her that the guy may have a crush on her. Then we went to sleep.\n\n Then she texted me and i left her on seen for the whole day. She then texts at the night \" Why would you leave me on read \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\". And that melted me , but i was honest and told her that i thought that i was Annoying and maybe she didn't wanna talk to me. Next day we meet in our classes. She enters,turns back and says \" YOURE NOT ANNOYING\" with a reassuring tone and smile.i gave a smile back.\n\n Since then we have been texting daily.  Once i didn't text her for 6-7 hours and she texted \" Where you at bro \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\" at midnight. I told her . And now she is talking with me everyday. Unfortunately we got separated as the batches got separated. Her best friend from the classes who is a smart girl went to another batch. She was sad about that and told me. And then she also snuck in this message \" well u and me got separated too.\" And I laughed it off. After a few reels, i sent a sad one about me never finding a girl. And i said \"i have accepted that no girl would ever like me \". She replied \"nah. i like you broo\" and honestly i couldn't fathom, i just ignored that and she changed the topic. Somehow i told her that all the guys she has met are garbage. She just said.\n\"No , you're nice. You're good. You're not a creep like them.\" Butterflies in stomach instantly. \n\n\nShe told me that she had a crush from classes. I thought it was the movie guy, but no it was the other dude. She liked him a lot and has had a crush on him. I wanted to cry, but i tried to get her with him. But he betrayed her and just called her very dumb and stupid in front of that class and backstabbed her. Obviously she told me and started crying.i was sad , but i hated that guy. \n\nShe has even shared with me a lot of her childhood stories, the current matter of her house. And she daily texts me either a message or a reel. And when she doesnt ,i do it. She has even told me that she has rejected a lot of boys in her school. She has told her type of boys who are smart and athletic. I fail both of them , I'm dumb , ugly, but good at sports. I tried to tease her with the guy she went to the movies with. But she denied it. She told me that he tried to learn towards her and she just went to the completely opposite side. She told me of her old relationship which ended because he was clingy. ( Now I'm clingy too, like a lot. If i like you i will be constantly talking to you).\n\nNow she liked this new guy and has told me about it. I went through her follow list. I literally died. I was the ugliest one in her list. All others are soo good looking than me , have something going in thier life. I k no one would want me, but this girl.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42, She gives me hopes. Although ik she just likes me as a friend but still somehow i think she likes me. She texts me everyday about something or the other. We have so many inside jokes. She has told me stories of her brother and her father. They are hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nBut i just don't see a possibility that she could like me more than a friend. I'm scared that she will be surprised. And when i confess. She will think that all the men are same and need sex. But i genuinely enjoy her company and her personality its just sooo loving. How can I not fall for her. She is literally perfect. I just wanna have her , forever and ever. But the fact that im ugly, prevents me from even thinking that. U might think I'm harsh on myself.but trust me , u won't want me. Im the most hideous guy in the class. I'm funny but that never helped me coz at the end of the day , thay all just rejected because of how i look. I just donk know. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14.\n\n\nBefore you make ur decision just keep this in mind.\nShe has 2 boy bestfriend.\nShe is extremely friendly to all the people in the class. Like very friendly, so im just thinking I'm no one special.\n\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n\nAlso one day i showed her my collection of sport trophies. She bluntly texted,\" Damn, why don't you get any girls.\" And then texted , \"Hold up imma come there (my house)\".\n\nI forgot to add something, once after the classes, it was raining. So we were all just taking out our umbrellas. I had it in my hand so i just started walking. From out of nowhere she just joins me in my umbrella and then we both are walking in an umbrella. I dropped her till the point where it wasn't raining and then went home. That was something marvellous that happened. I didn't want to talk about it over text with her. I thought it was a smaller thing not too big. And if I text her about that she will think I'm desperate or a creep. But then she decided to text me about it over text. She texted \"Thankyou for the umbrella\" and i was so happy",

    "content": " \n\nSo, there's a big-ass text that I'm going to write down here about my friends, and how they left me. I'm sorry for any inconvenience, and if I'm the toxic one in this relationship.\n\nWell, I had a group of friends that I was very close to, or at least I thought I was close to them, as you will see later. I started a friendship with them in the 1\u00b0year of high school, I had recently left my old school which was only a middle school, and with that, I lost some friends in the process, and I started to approach this group which was 3 people initially. And it was a fish out of water situation because I was a \"geek\" like them, but a \"geek\" who did sports, which differed from a \"geek\" who usually only watched anime and TV shows.\n\nDespite everything we understood each other, we had our internal jokes, laughed at nonsense, had discussions (which changed my political position -thank God-), but my father ended up not liking them, since, in his view, I would be using drugs and alcohol(which was even true in the alcohol part, but let\u2019s be honest, who never drank before 18 to throw the first stone), and it ended up with my father getting into my relationship with them, and they got mad at me, However, over time, I ended up understanding everything and relatively, I was able to have more freedom with them.\n\nUntil then, everything was fine, until I started to relate to my ex-girlfriend now, and I ended up distancing myself from these friends of mine so, it wasn\u2019t out of spite, I just really wanted to enjoy it with her. One of my friends got a little bit mad about it, but then, he realized it was something I had to have with my girlfriend, so that just made me think of a way to have the best of both worlds, to join my girlfriend with my group of friends. And incredibly initially, it worked, she loved them, and they loved her, too. They just realized that something hadn\u2019t happened between us, sex. And then on a trip with her family, that\u2019s where it all started. One of my friends wanted to understand what was going on between us, so we hadn\u2019t done it yet, and he went to talk to her about it. Even though my girlfriend was very shy, she opened up to my friend about this problem, and he helped her, in a very useful way, however, he fucked up, and what was supposed to be intimate with her, he ended up talking to one of my friends in the group, and my friend ended up coming to me via text, and my girlfriend saw this, and she felt extremely exposed to her intimacy. Put that together with a fact that we say was the click to my insecurity about them, which was then they did an account on Tinder to get new friends, and on that account, I wasn\u2019t called, nor raised as one of the friends on the account, no photo, a group of 5 people, without me. It ended up making me uncomfortable, and then other clicks ended up happening too, my birthdays that were usually forgotten, in the online group that we had, I usually said something was ignored, it was a recurring joke that I also have an invalid opinion, for me to... being me, which I always took for fun, I never took personally, except when it was more... heavy, or offensive. However, I still took it well, without fighting, by the way, it was and is still very difficult to fight with someone, only when someone ends up touching something that I have as personal. It ended up ruining my vacation with my girlfriend. I was thinking about just sex, and how they were distancing themselves from me, because also, by some stupid joke, one of the girls in the group ended up sending nudity to provoke the boys in the online group, And since my girlfriend wasn\u2019t very comfortable with the sex situation on its own, imagine nudes, it ended up for them to make a group of only four people (two boys, and two girls, dating), and there they would put more naked pictures, to provoke themselves. This ended up with them staying more in the +18 group (we are all of legal age), ignoring me in the group I was in. I was very uncomfortable with this, but I tried to take it well, I even tried to talk to one in private trying to explain how I was very unhappy with this. And with that, they schedule a conversation with me to explain that I was being a little wrong in my judgment, and I was overreacting, and how I should look at things differently, I explained my side, how I was feeling forgotten by them, and for a while until we understood, I even asked (which maybe shouldn\u2019t even be a request) for them to visit me in my city (we live in neighboring cities in Brazil), on my birthday (May), the visit at the end was made in September, and like, to put salt in the wound, a cousin(which I never had trouble starting a conversation) from one of my friends, joined this group, and let\u2019s say that she fit in very well, younger than me and much more mature too, and with that, the group was on her birthday (her first in the group)And it was said even after that they were fighting with each other, and there went some bullshit on the part of one of my friends. At this party, I was at my girlfriend\u2019s house (I was not invited to the party) when I woke up the other day from the party, my friend sent a message writing \"Yo, are you going to die as a Virgen?\" It was just normal bullshit at least, but the problem was that the person who read the message wasn\u2019t just me, it was my girlfriend, and like, she was upset, not mad at them, but upset that I had to go through with it. This problem was taken well and was not taken far ahead (which will make a little irony later).\n\nThings were starting to normalize, with me focusing on my studies, balancing things a little, with the help of my psychologist, but it occurred what unfortunately fucked up everything, being the pandemic, I ended up having to stay at my girlfriend\u2019s house, and I started getting close to my friend so that we became good friends by video chatting, then I went back to my mother\u2019s house for problems at my girlfriend\u2019s house, so it became a little harder to talk to both my girlfriend and them at first. But that changed with me getting a job, and with that, I got more time to talk to them together (it doesn\u2019t make sense, I know, but it just worked like that). The problem is that soon after that, I distanced myself from my girlfriend, we were fighting a lot, and totally without understanding each other, which led to our break up, for the reasons said earlier, with that I was free in the market and I wanted to promptly lose my virginity. Not for them and to end this joke about me, because I wanted to do it at once. I ended up having sex, and I talked to them about it... and they didn\u2019t seem to care much, because I didn\u2019t have my dad in my country, and my mom didn\u2019t care much about it, I kind of didn\u2019t have a lot of people to talk to, and I wanted to talk to them... and it hurt me a little bit(which I may have overreacted, but I wasn\u2019t at my best, and since we\u2019re talking about 7 years of friendship, they should have realized that I needed their help.).\n\nBefore I talk about the night that broke the camel\u2019s back, it is seen to remember that I also spoke many things of moments of anger, fear, confusion, and that hurt them too, I know that I am not a hero in this story, but it seemed that my mistakes were much more serious, how to talk nonsense and be told why, and someone in the group literally told me and I quote \"fuck you, motherfucker\", just by \"being on PMS\", I always saw myself in this group of friends as a... Clown, and make no mistake, I like that, but in its proper measure. What has always been seen is that the things I\u2019ve said, for example, to one of my friends' cousins in the matter of me always feeling compared to her (a thing I HATE, is to be compared to other people). What they took as the most important thing was that I said horrible things about this cousin of his (things I don\u2019t even remember anymore, but I didn\u2019t tell her to attack her directly, honestly I couldn\u2019t care more about her existence, but more by being compared to her.). It always left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, and I\u2019ve always had this fear of being rejected by them, my family did a lot of rejection, as well, so you get the idea.\n\nWell. Let\u2019s go that night. The idea was simple, it would be a boys' night, we would go to a bar, and then to a whorehouse, since we were all having little problems with our girlfriends (in this case I was officially single, they were \"taking a break\" from their girlfriends), I closed the point of my work, and went straight to the work of my friend we\u2019ll call L. (it\u2019s good to remember that I was talking to a girl and things were narrowing down between us). Leaving work, we passed the market and had a beer to warm up, and went with a co-worker of his together and invited him to the bar with us (after all, the more, the better). But that is where the problems begin. With the fact that another friend of mine (let\u2019s call him \"V\") called his cousin to go with him to the bar (that is, forget the boys' night), but okay, I can adapt to that, right? Well then L\u2019s wife (who was the girl who sent me a \"fuck you\" for me because she\u2019s from PMS, good to raise that point) showed up at the bar too, took me from his side, and left me on the corner of the table (it wasn\u2019t cool), and with that, I started to get very, VERY, UNCOMFORTABLE. And one detail about me, when I\u2019m uncomfortable, I can\u2019t hide my expressions and emotions, put it together with the fact that I want to try to connect to the subject at the table, and the co-worker at L, just yelled at me, saying \"WHAT?!\" (another detail of mine, I hate it when people yell at me needlessly.).That\u2019s when I thought \"fuck it\", and I started using my phone and I got the angry face if they wouldn\u2019t listen to me, I was going to stay in my little world, at first they assumed it was me sad because of my ex, and my recent breakup(which wasn\u2019t true, I didn\u2019t care a bit about my ex), and with that one of my friends (we\u2019ll call him M), started screaming at me from the other side of the table \"OH SHE SHOULD ALREADY BE WITH ANOTHER GUY\". I gave him a fake smile, and then they told him to stop it, and I was already giving a fuck about the situation, I decided to talk shit too and I decided to tell him that V\u2019s girlfriend too was single and that he could try to talk to her. The mood got tense, and soon my mother wanted me to come home (which was not what we agreed, since I would sleep at L\u2019s house, but at that moment I could not care less), they were angry at this bad joke (which I admit was a really stupid joke)And also mad that I\u2019m on the phone talking to that girl instead of enjoying it with them. I went home, fell asleep, and the other day, they had taken me out of the group (a recurring joke that I HATED), and I thought, \"Yeah, it\u2019s probably just a joke and they\u2019ll put me back soon,\" but it took a week, I asked about it for V, and they were wondering not to put me back, from the shit I said. I told him how it was messing with my head, and then I was put back... only to be judged by everyone for my \"mistakes\". The arguments were that I became an asshole who just wanted to have sex (remember the joke of me being a virgin? Yeah), that I was very willing to force my friendship with them, and that I wanted to have sex with V\u2019s girlfriend(something that when she sent a nude to provoke in the group, I was uncomfortable, as if to see my sister naked).\n\nI even tried to justify myself, but after seeing L talk, \"ah, I\u2019m tired of talking about it\" not caring...I decided not to even try, since they weren\u2019t even trying either, so they took me out of the group, and erased the memories, you know? They didn\u2019t talk to me, they didn\u2019t send Merry Christmas (by the way, they took a group trip, and obviously they didn\u2019t tell me even to fuck off), and actually, their memories were erased, 7 years of being thrown away... and that\u2019s 2.5 years old, and I made some friends, but none with the same chemistry... I think... I feel really confused about this, I don\u2019t know if I made a mistake (which I probably made a mistake), but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I should get new friends. Or rather, how I should get new friends. What makes me draw the line is the phrase L told me \"don\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over, smile, because it happened\"... fuck you and your Dr. Seuss.\n\nAfter I write this, it's weird, I feel a little better just by writing, probably because I was holding that for 2 and half years. So a little info about me.\n\nFirst one: I have family issues, not the typical alcoholic father, my father was one of my closest friends, not in a scenario where I got no friends, but, as he was very similar to me, being the same music taste, we both are judo fighters(he is a black belt, I'm purple), and we normally use more heart than our brains, but even tho I have this relationship with him, I still feel like I have to prove worthy of being his son, make no mistake, he isn't that Asian parent who wants his kid to be the best student or the best fighter, but I feel like that I should be, by having an awesome dad by my side, it can be simplified with \"pressure\", even tho that was in my head alone.\n\nSomething you should know is that I can make friends with ease, but, I don't make real REAL friends get it? I have a ton of friends, but not a \"best friend\", or someone that feels this way, I always had friends that I wouldn't be so close with or friends that I want to be close with and they don't seem to have the same vibe, it can be narrow down to never being in the same vibe, people that don't feel the same way I do.\n\nBut I'm not only having issues with my father, I have way more problems with my mother, my father's issues can be resolved by simply talking with him, but my mother no, my teenage years were very confusing and frustrating for her part, as a divorce happened when I was 12 years old, I didn't understand what happened, I just thought that was only my parents having a argue about whatever was in that time, however, that wasn't the case, and my mother didn't take very well, she would have a new relationship in a few months, and later on, she would have a baby with my stepfather(keep in mind that I was probably 12). My stepfather is also a great problem, as he didn't help a lot to have a good relationship with me, and was more worried about my grades at the time(which wasn't a bad thing, don't get me wrong, I get that he was trying to help, but, he didn't need it to even assault me in front of my mom and 1-year-old step-brother.).\n\nSecond one: I have medically proven that I have ADHD since I was 8(I guess), which is something that is a blessing and a curse to me, as I can't focus on one thing, such as I should be studying right now, but writing this is taking A LOT of weight of my chest, and my head. Being a hyperactive and attention deficit person isn't peaches and cream, it sucks, I would normally want to focus on my friends when I was with them, but, I don't know, I should take medicine(props to my stepfather who said that was BS), to have better relationships with other people, and this excuse will sound sucky, but I was very afraid to lose who I was, my unpredictable sense of humor, my personality trait of being a funny weirdo is something that I liked about me, its confusing, I know, and I need ASAP therapeutic and psychiatric monitoring.\n\nThird one: I normally feel the urge to prove to everyone that they are wrong about me, but sometimes I just want to not be always proving everything, I just want to be me, and people like me by being that, like that funny guy who everyone likes to be around when they come, to do stupid jokes, even childish jokes, just for fun you know? Perhaps that's the problem, I can't be a funny guy, and be respected if I can't take things seriously because I hate people in a bad mood, people with heavy energy, who want to stand above everyone else for whatever reason, and to be honest, that group was that was almost as a free-for-all, they where friends, until they aren't anymore, maybe was good to leave them, but also I feel weird about all that, it's the classic seeing them on Instagram, on Facebook, on social media being productive, being happy, being themselves. I can't be what they can be, because they aren't real, it's like CM Punk says \"I've grabbed so many of Vincent K. McMahon's brass rings that it's finally dawned on me that they're just that, they're completely imaginary\". The only thing that's real is me.\n\nIn the end, I read this text that I made, and the only thing is in my mind is, why I keep trying to talk with them(I'm talking with one of them about the public college entrance exam because he is on this college), but I even go through my mind imaginary scenarios where they are sorry, or even trying to retry or friendship(which I know, I'm stupid just by thinking about that.).",

    "content": "Hello fellow redditors, first of all I\u2019m sorry if I make any punctuation or grammar mistakes. English isn\u2019t my native language and sorry if this post is in a weird format. I\u2019m typing this on my phone but anyways here some background info:\n\nSo I recently moved back to my parents due to financial issues. I used to work as a Manager in a car rental and the job was shitty. My boss was a fucking cheap ass and didn\u2019t want to hire more people (we were horribly understaffed!) and he also was a choleric. So screaming and bitching was almost always on his daily routine but he also had a good site. \n\nAnyways in December I tried to kill myself and ended up in a psych ward for a week. The whole reason for my action was the whole stress that built up in me over the past 3 years. \n\nBefore everything in my life turned into a shit show I meet this girl online and I started to like her a lot. She did like me back but she ended up friend zoning me. The whole deal is a bit complicated and explaining the whole story would make the post only longer. The important info is; she friend zoned me, I still like her, we are still in touch and she sees me as her best friend (I do too but with stronger feelings). I haven\u2019t told her that. \n\nIn January I quit my job for good and wanted to start looking for a job in a car dealership. Tbh I wasn\u2019t giving 100% and just wrote a couple of applications and let it slide. Over the past year I became kinda an alcoholic. I started with just one beer in evening and after some time I started drinking Vodka. \n\nSo the months were I was unemployed and alone I\u2019d just get drunk and get more depressed. It got so worse that I didn\u2019t even eat that much and just got drunk. I spend one whole week binge drinking vodka bottles and felt like utter shit. \n\nIt was like end of February/or March when I got sick and almost died. No it was not Corona. I had blood in my lungs and couldn\u2019t breathe anymore, my face turned all blue and stuff and I called an ambulance. The doctors told me that some veins were blocked. After my near death experience I had to stay there for 3 weeks. \n\nWhen I got released I just fell into my depression and started binge drinking again. I still had no job so the bills got more and more. I had the glorious idea to move back to my parents place and try to get a job there. I called my mom and told her about that (btw the idea came to me while drunk af). The next day I just shrugged it of and didn\u2019t think about moving back. \n\nIn June I went to the psych ward again but this time I wanted to go there because prior to this I was drinking heavily and I wanted to change something. \n\nSomehow my ex boss knew that I was there again and he called my dad. My dad came and was like come home and stuff. I didn\u2019t really think thru it and was like okay. So I packed all my stuff, canceled my apartment and got me a truck. I had my doubts because I didn\u2019t really want to and also I wanted to be near my crush. \n\nWell I thought if I was far away from her my feelings would just go away too, they didn\u2019t. \n\nMy housing situation is shit. I have no own room I have to sleep on a mattress in the living room. I feel like I sacrificed a lot of my freedom. \n\n3 weeks ago I called my boss and I asked if I could comeback (I know dumb move but I fucking hate it here) he was like he can\u2019t hire anyone right now due to COVID. He said I should look for an apartment there. Well at first I did but after a time I got lazy and shrugged it off. \n\nOne of my best friend is moving out and his room would be free. His brother (also one of my best friends) asked me if I wanted to get his room. I agreed to it because I always wanted to move in with that jerk. \n\n3 days ago my ex boss called me at fucking 2am I didn\u2019t answer because I thought he is drunk or something. He tried again to call me but this time on a more appropriate hour. I didn\u2019t answer tho. So he called my dad and told him that he has a flat free (he bought some houses and is putting them on rent). My parents asked me if I wanted to go back and tbh I\u2019m not sure. Well I still want to be near my crush. \n\nI\u2019m still unemployed but I started sending applications like crazy lately. \n\nMy ex Chef also offered me a job again but I haven\u2019t called him back yet. I told my parents about my plan to move in with my best friend but they want batshit crazy and didn\u2019t approve on that. They think it\u2019s weird that two guys are living together. We are both straight btw. \n\nAfter a huge argument they told me that people would talk and to quote my dad \u201conly gays live together that\u2019s not normal\u201d he also low key threatened me. That he wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. \n\nMy best friend and I are regular weed smokers but weed is illegal here. So he threatened with police and to be frank they wouldn\u2019t do jack shit with any proof lol. My mom also was like \u201cif you do that don\u2019t call me your mother again\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not really close to them and honestly I don\u2019t like them either. So their threats of cutting contact to me doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nSo I have two options to choose from: \n\n1. Go back to my previous job and have an own apartment again BUT I have to work again in that shitty company again. (Well I had some really cool coworkers and I kinda miss them) \n\n2. Move in with my buddy and start a war with my family \n\n\nStaying at my parents isn\u2019t an option. I won\u2019t stay any longer with this lunatics. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this hard but can\u2019t get any conclusion. I\u2019d appreciate some advice.",

    "content": "I've been single and unloved for the past 15 years. All i want in life is one person at my side, not above me, not below me...I was babysitting a friend's cat (we'll call her kat) for the past 2 years until she was able to take him back. When i returned kitty, she told me she had a friend she'd like to introduce me to (ill call her junkie, for obvious reasons). Me and junks hit it off within the first 2 days of meeting. I let her move into my house b/c she had no one who'd take her in. Little did i know, Kat would interfere with every aspect of our relationship, she is a pathological liar (they both are) and they've been institutionalized multiple times for suicide attempts and other mental issues. Kat would sit in her apartment all day and make up hypothetical scenarios just to blame me for them. I'm just an average joe who works a 9-5 job and is trying to better my life (buying a house, i dont do any drugs, i only drink on average once or twice a month, i dont smoke). Anyway, myself and junkie start dating and having a good life together. She would go hang out with Kat every now and again, which i was find with, my job is very physically demanding, so most days i would feel too drained to want to do any hanging out with kat, which lives a few towns over. Junkie is a bit of an oddball, like myself, having an enjoyment of walking around graveyards and having a lot of dark humor(which really makes me like her more, i've always been like that). We're having a decent, enjoyable relationship, when a week or two later, the issues start coming to light.\n\nWe went shopping and junkie started shoplifting, it wasnt even useful stuff, just random junk. We'd go to a gas station, and she'd steal beer. i could not take her to a store without her stealing. Also, within the first week, junkie is hanging out with kat one night, when kat's ex bf comes to her house, we all go walk the mall to kill time(with junkie pocketing all kinds of things) and the exbf buys her a pack of cigarettes, and i notice the whole time, hes making very rapey moves towards junkie, constantly touching her when she expressed not to, not keeping his hands to himself, making suggestive comments. I leave the girls thinking they were going to spend the night at Kat's appt. Junkie calls me a few hours after getting home saying they were going to go spend the night at the exbf's house, which i didnt feel comfortable with at all. When i go to get her the next day, they ask me to sit down because they have some very effed up stuff that went down that night. Kat eventually fell asleep on the couch that all 3 were hanging out on, when exbf started telling junkie that i did not deserve her, that she owed him sexual favors for him buying her those smokes, that he could give her adderall if she'd perform sexual favors on him, and generally giving her a rapey vibe. She did not sleep at all that night fearing what he'd attempt to do to her if she did. He also expressed having sex with her on the very couch that Kat was sleeping on. Due to these events, i asked her to stop communications with him, i cursed him out and told him that he was a terrible friend for trying all this and blocked him. After that, myself and junkie continued out relationship with her occasionally going spend time at kat's house(the whole time she was stealing from any store they'd visit and was constantly stealing and drinking beer, she's on a lot of medications for her behavioral disorders, including barbiturates)\n\nThings continue relatively normal over the next month. though Kat would occasionally message me with passive aggressive messages accusing me of things she made up in her head... I began expressing concern with Kat constantly interfering in our relationship, causing drama that wasn't even there. I decided to stop going to hang out with Kat because of her actions. I also asked junkie to not go as often.\n\nI eventually introduced junkie to my family, and we went to my brother's house once, and my brother was smoking meth. She asked him for some, which he gave(she was also drinking) and this upset me greatly, she was telling me how she loved me, wanted a future with me, wanted a family with me, how she wanted to better her life and give up all the drug abuse. We hung out for a few hours with her constantly asking him for more. When we got home that night i was so upset, i smashed all the remaining alcohol containers that i had in my home, i was tired of the constant drinking. She did not sleep at all that night(obviously, she was on meth). Things began progressing downhill after that, she was constantly shoplifting and drinking every day over the next few weeks. Last friday when i was at work, she text me telling me she was going hang at Kats house. She promised she would be home when i got off. She didnt come home that night, she was supposedly with Kat, who was enabling her bad habits. She stayed at kats that night, then at 4am, they both started messaging me accusing me of being on facebook messenger, talking to someone, that i was ignoring them, etc. I had taken some melatonin and gone to sleep at 9pm that night, putting my phone on silent to stop Kat's constant threats/aggressive messages. At 5am Junkie woke me up asking me who i was talking to, that i was reading her messages and not replying(with Kat in the living room). I had been asleep all night. they left soon after i told them i attempted to go back to sleep. Saturday she went drinking heavily with kat feeding the problems. Saturday night i got into an argument over all this and told her if she didnt want to come home to stay gone. She then threatened to commit suicide by overdose on all her prescription meds. i gave in and told her she had this one chance to prove she wanted to be with me. over the next few hours she sent me very long texts apologizing for her behavior and saying she wanted a forever with me, a happy family with me. she then said she had gotten permission to go visit her daughter for a few hours sunday, so i accepted that and told her to go be with her daughter, and to stay in communication so that i'd know she was ok, she also said she was too drunk to drive that night, so i let her stay by Kat's. Sunday comes, she doesnt answer my calls nor texts for at least 4 hours, when she finally does, says shes driving to her ex husband(the daughter's dad) and its almost 200 miles away. So i tell her to text me when she can so i can know how things are going. She says later in the day that she was on her way home at 1pm. at 4pm i ask her where she is, if shes ok. She replies that shes eating dinner with her mom and shopping(she has literally no income, her parents pay all her expenses) so that begins a chain of doubt. 2 hours later i ask her where she is... still shopping. So i get upset and tell her to just come home to me, i miss her and just want to spend time together. we were supposed to spend the whole weekend together. She eventually gives in and says she's on her way. at 7pm she still hadnt made it home (it should have been a 1.5 hour drive back, it took her 7 hours) she pulls up, with a beer in hand, driving. And of course she has Kat with her, i ask here why she'd go 30 mins in the opposite direction to get kat, she says they've been hanging out since friday and that she didnt really go see her child. So i tell her that she just used her one chance, that ill help her pack and she can go. It takes about 40 mins to pack everything, the whole time, she keeps saying \"i dont know why you're acting like this, i dont feel like i did anything wrong\". This weekend was supposed to be for me and her, to get to know each other better, to talk, to be a couple. After i help her pack everything, she goes to kats house, texting me at like 11pm saying she forgot something and that she wanted to talk. I find the item she left, give it to her, and all she says is \"kat's waiting on me, you have work in the morning, im not gonna keep yall up\" and she leaves. the next day, i find out through multiple sources that she slept with Kat's exbf, the very guy who attempted to force himself on her a month ago. I contact her mom, who insists i help her find Junkie. So i take the day off and help, after getting threatened by Kat that if i came anywhere near them i'd be arrested.  That made me give up and just go home. Later that night junkie texts me insulting me at every chance (looks, sexual performance, trashy family, i deserve to die, being poor, etc). She said that she spent the whole weekend with Kat, shoplifting from all the local stores and drinking, and that she did cheat on me the very night we broke up...\n\nI just wanted a life with her, i was actually opening my heart to her after being alone for over a decade. I just want one girl to make my life feel whole. I was doing everything in my life to be better for her, i was eating healthy, i cut back heavily on sodas, i was exercising, i had lost 20 lbs since we started dating. I dont understand how someone can claim to love you one day then cheat on you the next. Im tired of being alone, i just want one person in my life who will make me feel wanted. I dont have many friends, i dont speak with my family often, im just alone, in the house im working on buying. I'm not abusive, im not violent, i treat my significant other like they're the only person in the world. i just want love in my life....",

I am hoping to get a few responses, but the last few times I tried doing something like this on reddit, it got taken down because this wasn't right or that wasn't right, and I put alot of time into writing this, and don't want it just looked over**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a made up account, i don't know how much it matters since no-one i know personally knows my main acct or even uses reddit, but w/e I don't know what to do anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease someone give me some advice, somewhere to turn, or just tell me you've been in my shoes and that things are OK for you now. Give me some shed of light, cuz I'm starting to actually feel myself falling in the hole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs bad or wrong or w/e this may sound I just want to put this out there first. I HAVE A PROBLEM, I probably can/could change it but I don't. I am very unmotivated and am very manipulative to myself and friends/family. I do want advice, but having people just say, if I'm disappointed in myself use that to make a change. I've been telling myself that for 5 years and it hasn't worked. Simply telling myself I can change or I need to will not help me. Trying to tell the people I'm close to a lesser story of whats actually going on and asking for help doesn't help. I feel that if I'm going to change I need outside help from a source that will not be any sort of biased towards anything if I'm going to get out of this hole. Does that make me sound lazy and an asshole? Maybe, but I need help and I feel that it needs to be something totally different or new.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't plan for this to come out as long as it did, I just wanted to give my whole story, I tried to kinda format it a bit so people can peruse it if they wish, and it probably isn't in much order, I just started typing and ended with all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions about me or my life or wants to know more, feel free to post it here or msg me. Thank you to anyone who reads this or replies, this is a tough for me to admit wrong, and that I'm not strong enough for help makes me disappointed in myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you asked me where I see myself in 5 years. I don't see myself getting better and being able to have a family good job and on my own. Right now, I would say either homeless, dead, or in jail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Shorter \"TL;DR\" Story**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n32 white male, grew up living with family n friends and a very lazy no responsibility lifestyle. I am now a jobless alcoholic, who has no direction in life and might get kicked out. I have a terrible credit score, no savings, nothing. and about 40K total in debt.\n\nI drink heavily at least 5 days a week, and smoke alot of pot. I don't do any other form or drug. my health is going down hill, I don't know to what measure, or physically or mentally. I'm scared, depressed, and sometimes wish I just didnt wake up the next morning. \n\nThe drugs are taking me over and I don't think I can tell myself I can change anymore. \n\nLiving with my dad, who thinks I don't drink as much as I do, or even smoke weed. Thinks I'm getting my life in order, and even then wants me out as soon as I can.\n\nI just lost my job again, he doesn't know, leaves for vacation for 1.5 weeks on Wednesday. If i tell him the trip will be ruined, my current plan is to just smoke and drink myself out as much as i can while they are gone. when they get home tell them everything (which will be hard on my own as it is, but my life needs a change whether i want it or not, and coming out about it makes others aware and then i can lie/hide it anymore) and that I need help and don't know where to go, or whats in store for me, and see where things go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**GROWING UP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle backstory, I'm a 32 white male, born and raised in WA state. I was adopted when I was just a few days old (I don't know much about it honestly, just that it was pre-arranged, and I was probably unplanned and my biological mom was young). Grew up in a very religious and sheltered family. The type where my parents would watch a tv show or movie first to make sure it was OK, and if it had more than a few swear words it was a nope. Same with music, and video games. I got a Sega Genesis as a kid, and one christmas I got a \"game pack\" it had like 3 cartridges each with 2 games on it. 1 cartridge was sonic n some other kids game, the other was mortal kombat and some other fighting game, and the 3rd was like  shooting/military or something. Guess who got a game pack with only the Sonic cartridge? Me. I went to church every Sunday and Wednesday. 2 Services on sunday (church service, then youth group) and Wednesday was AWANA, which is like the jesus version of boy scouts, and when I got older we just had \"youth group\". I went to a private school from K to 7th Grade, a small church who runs an elementary school, with class sizes of like 12 and the same class and teacher all day/all year. Once I got to 7th grade I told my family I wanted to go to public school. I wanted to take the school bus, and have different periods and teachers, and classes. It made me feel older and cooler. They agreed and I went into public school my 8th grade year and stayed until I graduated in 2005.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a very rich, white, small community. The kind where people lived in mansions on the water and got all their money from their parents, then they live lavish lifestyles the rest of their life, and do the same with their kids, who eventually just take over their parents wealth later in life. alot of kids would get nice cars for their 16th BDay (BMW, MB, Audi), and would throw huge parties with drugs and alcohol every weekend cause their parents didnt care. Not to digress, alot of these kids grew up together, went to school together, sports, everything. So when I showed up, I was the outcast, and wasn't too popular. I didnt have alot of money either, or cool cars or gadgets. So outside of school I didn't have much of a social life, other than church (which I was forced to go until I was 18). So here I am trying to be cool and rebel out at school so I can try and make friends, when my only real friends/life were surrounded by religion which i was starting to not care about or want anything to do with anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy father works for the government. Went into the navy for 4 years out of school, got out and got a civilian job and been working there ever since (he will be 60 this year). He had a 2 hour commute to work, and would get up at 4AM, go to work, get home \\~6. We would have dinner, a small family convo, mom n dad would argue 2-3 times a week and then he would go to bed at 8, and get up n do the same thing again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom has always been a stay at home mom and never had a problem with it but stayed busy. My dad worked a good position, made a decent salary, and my whole time growing up, my mom didn't have a job or really do anything, and she didn't seem to mind it, she would take care of the house, take us to school, watch her friends dogs while they were at work etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have a sister who is 6 years older than me. But as long as I can remember she was always very \"distant\" she kinda did the same thing as me, she had religion forced on her, rebelled, but once she turned 18, she was out and on her own, we would talk to her 2-3 times a year and see her about the same (holidays). I didn't not like my sister, i just felt like I never really knew her as a person, much less my Sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I started getting older and maturing, I saw things differently. I realized my mom was the very very very religious one and my dad not so much. He would go to church and talk to his friends and dress up, but at home he would get upset easily, he would never hit my mom or cause a scene in front of us, but if he gets hurt or something goes wrong, hes punched a wall before. Now hes not as bad, he still gets upset to easily over small things, but most of the time, we just say \"dont get mad over small things like that, calm down, etc\" and hes been better. Thats the reason my parents would fight alot. My dad spent so much time at work, then he wasn't that religious of a person really, and so they would butt heads alot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne year on my b-day, my parents got in a fight about something, I don't remember exactly what it was or w/e, I don't even remember the year it was between 16-18. But he finally said he didn't want to stay the night at home, and he was going to get a hotel near work for the night and would be back the next day, and that my birthday present was in the closet.  That was pretty much the turning point. He came back and they tried to mend things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a year later Dad came home early really energetic and excited, and he sat us all down and told us that there was a work opportunity overseas for us. He had the option to go to Japan for 4 years, his salary would increase, they would pay him housing/etc for ALL of us, so we could go live there, and they would pay for a storage space so we could empty our house out and rent it out for 4 years. Sounds great right? I wanted to go, dad wanted to go, but mom didn't. She said she had to much here, we had 2 small dogs that would never get in, culture was so different, on and on. He told her he really wanted to go, Japan was so cool, and how could you not? You get paid more, your housing and needs are pretty much all free, and you can make extra income from renting your house out. But mom wouldn't do it. They ended up agreeing to have him go for a few months at a time, then come home from a few months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first it seemed like it might work, he was going for 2-3 months and coming home and being around for 2-3 months. We all got passports and went and visited, that was my first time abroad and really traveling (been to CA a few times). Then after all that, his trips started getting longer, he needed more time to get his project done and couldn't take that short of increments. Then they started fighting more, calling less, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne year I went out to Japan on my own to be with him for the whole summer. I was so excited, he worked 40+ hours a week, I had a amazing place to stay, plenty of money to just literally wake up and explore for 3 months. Then one night we were walking back from the bar and my dad told me that, him and mom were going to split up. When he told me I kinda already saw it coming, but when he actually said it, I just kinda went \"Oh, ok..well interesting\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that all our trips to japan slowly quit. My sister \"disavowed\" our family, because \"dad split up with mom\" so she hates him (and all men now, shes a little out there....) and since mom wasn't strong enough to see it coming or let dad take \"advantage\" of her in the divorce, so she told us all she needed space and was going to go somewhere n do her own thing and that she loved us and would talk to us again at some point, just didnt know when and to leave her alone in the mean time. That was \\~4 years ago, and haven't heard/seen her since. I don't even know if shes alive. I don't really care that much since i never really got to know her, more of just a lost touch of a friend. But mom was torn up by it, she's tried finding and emailing/calling her even though my sister said no, she feels bad about doing it, which makes my sister a total bitch. She found her info once, and emailed her, and just said \"I miss you, I love you, Hope you ok\" , and my sister went off on her, about privacy etc. My dad also didn't take advantage of my mom. She never worked a day in her life, and she did not mind that. It was only AFTER the divorce she started saying how she wanted to work a full time job the whole time but dad wouldn't let her cuz of his work, thats all BS. She still gets a decent amount from him, certain amount of his pay, and half his retirement. They were married 25+ years and been divorced for 8.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad remarried, to a Philipino lady. At first i was nervous, but once i met her she turned out Ok. Shes a few years younger than my dad. Lived in Japan the last 25 years working, and was married to a Japanese guy, and had 2 boys. He left them and she raised the 2 boys by herself until they were teens and she met my Dad. They have been married awhile and her and one of my step brothers live with us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AFTER HS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFamily is now outta the way, onto me. After HS, i thought about military or college, but ended up getting a dead end job somewhere. I worked 2-3 different jobs between 2005-2010. I went back to school in 2010, because I was old enough to not claim my parents on my finacial aid and could finally go. I was in school from 2010-2013, taking Aviation classes to become an Air Traffic Controller. I lived in student housing and got enough in my loans I didn't have to work while I went to school. Once i finished in 2013, literally my last quarter the FAA changed their regulations for getting into their Academy, and were taking people off the streets and not giving advantage to people who had gone to school already and had college credit, since you had to go to their academy after anyways. Between going to school so late, and just being lazy, I didn't get accepted into the Academy, and to be an ATC, you have to be in their academy by your 31 or 32 birthday. I'm 32 now, and out of luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter school, I moved back in with mom, and got a job at Burger King. It was supposed to just be a starting job and get me by until I could use my school degree for a better job. Well, 2 years later I was still living at home, starting to form drinking habits, and live a reclusive life in my moms basement. She didn't know my lifestyle, and wouldn't accept it, but I had nowhere else to live, so i hid it from her as long as I could. Early 2016 we got in a huge fight, and I told her I was going to take all my stuff and move out. One of my 5 good friends from HS, lived a few hundred miles away and was going to school in Central WA. I called him up and he said come on in, I don't know if u can live here but long enough to get you going. So i packed up what I could into my explorer and drove out there with no plan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up spending just under 2 years in Central WA. my roomate was living in an apartment with his G-ma, and we started talking to his dad (who is very rich..like 3 vacation houses rich) and my friend told his dad he could see himself living out here, and wanted to make roots, and I was there now, so he convinced his dad to buy a 220K house. His dad dropped 110K and mortgaged the rest. The mortgage came out to like 1200 bucks, and he ended up just telling all of us to pay him 1200 flat a month between the 3 of us and he would cover the rest (between fees, utilities, etc). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got a job at the BK out there, worked there for a few months, and decided to quit, I got a job at Carl's Jr. and few weeks later quit, got a job at a deli and ended up quitting. I got into this pattern of not caring about having to work, because I didn't need too. My friends rich dad was pretty much letting us live out there for free. \n\nI got a job as a tow truck driver and did that for about 6 months, and that was probably the happiest point in my life so far. It was a shitty job, but I didn't know anything about the industry. I just finally had a job that \"mattered\" to other people. I got to drive a huge 26ft flat bed all across the state, and pick people up from the freeway and drive them 200 miles home. Half the trip was talking to strangers (which helped my social anxiety SO much) I used to hate to talk to ppl in public and if I had to it was one word sentences the whole time. Now I'm the total opposite. The other half was me just driving on my own, big diesel rig, fuel/oil fumes, blaring music, chain smoking cigarettes. It was just the life. Problem was it was a shit job, I was on call 24/7 for 4 days a week. I only got paid when I was actually towing and I would get like 20% of the total pay of the job. There were days where I would get 1 call and make 20 bucks but I would still be on call. I never left my house or really got into anything. I felt like I couldn't even be in the shower cuz the phone might ring. I got paid monthly with no form of real pay stub, it would come in differnt colors every month and written on torn school paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne night I was starting a drive back home, and it was about 8PM, takes about 2 hours to get home, and I was on my first call at like 10AM that morning so I was ready to go home n go to bed. I get a text from my boss saying they had another tow for me when I got into town and it was BACK to seattle where I currently was. That meant I had to drive 2 more hours home, pick up the vehicle, drive BACK another 2 hours to Seattle, then drop them off then another 2 hours back. It was easily going to be a 6-8 hour job. I texted my boss n said I really didn't wanna do it, I was 2 hours away, from another 4 hour job, it was 8PM, i still had 2 more hours, I was tired and I only had 1 day off that week since I was going on vacation the next week and agreed to work basically 10-12 days STRAIGHT 24/7 ON CALL, so I could get a week long vacation to go to my grandfathers funeral. I finally told him not only was I tired but didn't feel safe enough to do it. He texted me to park the truck at the garage and leave my keys at the office and go home. I tried to call/text him but he wouldn't respond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up losing that job and was jobless yet again. My HS friend was starting to see a pattern with me, and \"trying\" to find work and just being overall lazy, he finally told me at the end of the year I had to get out. I didnt have too many friends out there, my mom had just sold our house and moved into a tiny 1 bedroom apt, so i couldnt live there. My dad had moved back from japan earlier that year, so I reached out to him and asked if I could come live there, I figured he would help me, and we could get closer again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI moved in with my dad January of 2018. I found a job at a Red Lobster 2 weeks later, and started working there as a dishwasher. At first I wasn't happy, my dad was policing me alot, cause he thought I had a drinking problem (i do) and I was smoking alot of weed since it became legal. He didn't want any of that in the house, and if he found it I was on the street. After a few months he relaxed on the drinking and we would drink n smoke cigars together. I started getting more hours and moved out of the dish pit at work and learning prep and cooking. In August the new girl I was training we ended up seeing each other and got fairly serious and in Dec, were thinking about trying to get a place together, but because of my habits we ended up apart, we we're still co-workers but I ended up losing my job at Red Lobster for not following the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad was not happy. I went from being happy, and seeing something again, to nothing and it hit me HARD. It took me 2 months to find a new job, I did nothing all day and drank all night. Never spent much time with the family (dinner, do things outside, etc). He told me I needed to get my act together and not let that happen again. In Feb I got a job at Chipotle and started working there, and started getting over my ex and being happy again. The last month I've been spending alot of time with my family, everyone is happy, and my dad and step mom aren't on me as much about things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MY PROBLEM**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that my life is out of the way lets get to the problem. Me. I finally see it now and need to make a change. Since HS, I've worked 10+ dead end jobs, lived with my mom, rich family friend from HS, and now my dad. I drink. heavily. Its only been about a year that I've been drinking heavily. I never drank before college, I tried a few times in HS, but didn't care for the after effects and trying to hide if from my all holy mother. I started drinking at college parties and slowly grew into a habit. but I'm talking 5-6 days a week drinking at least a 6 pack of beer. Now I drink booze, and will usually go through about half a bottle of rum or w/e it is a night. I'm also smoking a lot more weed. I went from having 1 Gram last me 4-5 days, to smoking a gram or so a day. Dad doesn't know about all of that, I do a good job of hiding it. He knows I drink and he thinks I drink moderately and thinks I should tone it down and he thinks I drink maybe 3-4 beers every 2-3 days, not half a bottle of rum a night. If he knew he would def not be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also not good with money. Since I've lived at my dads for 1.5 years now, I haven't saved any money at all, or ever really. I've always gotten paid and just gone out and spent it. I've told him I wanted to and it would always be next check, next check. I worked for a year of that part time not making much, but still I spent it all on my bills, then going out, booze and weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause I'm not good with money, I'm not good with anything credit related. I checked my score a few weeks ago, and it was 460. I had 4-5 credit cards when I turned 18, and when I got the bills, if I didn't have enough or wanted to pay it, i figured i could pay it next month. Well lets just say they all went into collections. Some got charged off, some are still there, and I've gotten some more debts since. I currently have 2 open credit cards with Capital One, that are both full (1 is 300 and the other is 400 limit) They are both 5 payments behind, and are more like 400 on one and 500 on the other. I owe the state about 250 bucks, and an old cell phone bill that was charged off thats another 300 bucks. All in all my Credit score is very low, and according to Credit Karma, I have 4 open accounts. 2 of them are my credit cards (even though they are still open, they are more than 90 late so they reported it) I have another balance of 130 for something and then 33K in student debt that I forego or w/e every year, I don't have to pay it but its increasing. I think I have more debt that that, but thats all that credit karma is showing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also do not have a vehicle, I had an old 1997 Ford Explorer that died and haven't had a car since. Dad lets me use his car for errands, and I can rely on the bus where I live. Hes told me that now that I have a better paying full time job I can start putting money away, paying off my debts and get another car and then get my own place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just lost my job on Friday. I did too much stupid shit, called out to many times, was late to many times, w/e, I lost my job. Dad does not know and I haven't told him yet. They are all leaving for Hawaii on Wednesday for almost 2 weeks. I know everyone would be very upset and I know it would affect/ruin/stop their trip from happening, so I'm just playing it off like everything is normal until they leave Wednesday AM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last few days I've realized a lot. The last 5 years I've been telling myself, my family, my friends and my job/co-workers that I would change, could change, and things would be different, but nothing has changed, and things are just getting worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need help, and I don't think I or any friends or family can help, that hasn't done anything good for the last 5 years. I can lie and hide things from them, we have a relationship so it's not the same as getting outside help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm scared and don't know what I should do, I don't have a car, any credit, I have only a few hundred bucks to my name, and I'm worried that my dad will have had enough if I tell him. I can't go live with my mom, I have no friends I can go live with. I think about my dad and how he wants me out, but would he really throw me out knowing I have ZERO money or Savings, and don't even have a car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought about just applying any/everywhere and getting a new job before they get home, but what if I can't? What if I do? How will things be different? I say I want to change but I don't. If I open up to him about all my drinking and smoking then hes just going to have to police me constantly and that will just create more drama with the family, and I don't want him to have to do that. I'm disappointed in myself that I'm this lazy and this careless, but at the same time I don't change. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I don't need rehab, worst thing I do is smoke weed and drink a lot, but I also tell myself I'm not THAT bad, I cant be right? I don't need to seek out a rehab facility that I go off to to change my lifestyle, thats for people worse off than me. But then I also tell myself, am I saying that because of the state I'm in? everyone in that position says that, is it really alot worse that I think? It cant be right? But then where do I turn? A counselor or therapist?  I know I'm depressed, I go through mood swings, but I don't yell at people or punch walls or anything like that, I usually just keep to myself and just stare at the wall when I'm sad/down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Sometimes I feel like I should go do something small that wouldn't hurt anyone, but be bad enough to send me to jail for 6 months to get me away from life. I don't want to die, but sometimes I feel like what if I just went to sleep one day and then didn't wake up. 2-3 times a month I will wake up in the morning and I'm legit just sad, I feel like I want to cry and have no motivation for the day. I really don't like that I feel that way and tell myself to be happy but I just cant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to play video games a lot. I don't as much anymore, I am very indecisive the last few years. At work I would say I cant wait to get home I'm gunna play this game and have fun today! Then I get home and dont want to play anymore, will tell myself lets play this, open it up play for 5-10 minutes then close it down and find something else. rinse and repeat. Its not just video games, life in general. I'll want to take the bus into town smoke a joint and go walk around. 5 minutes later I lost my motivation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can tell my drinking is affecting my health now, last 2-3 months I've been seeing small spots that I'm telling myself are small bruises, but could be liver spots. I'm just under 6 foot and close to 300 lbs. I was a comp. swimmer from age like 8 to 18, so I have a good build of muscle but I'm also a big guy, but to put it in context if I asked people how much they thought I weighted I would get more like 250 than 300. I'm not very active, I haven't worked out, excercised or anything in at least 4 years. I walk to the the bus and I'm on my feet all day, but I'm still out of shape. Lets just say the last 3 years I've been able to maintain my weight while eating if I had to guess prob \\~2000 calories a day, plus at least another 500 with the booze every night. Gross I know, but my poop is pretty much been just runs the last 8 months, and most mornings I wake up with a headache. Another sign I know I'm drinking too much, I don't really get drunk anymore. I'll drink my half bottle, and feel it and feel good, but at the same time I don't feel drunk. I tell myself I wish I could feel that drunk feeling where you know what your seeing/saying, but your body does other things. I also dont get hangovers really anymore. I usually wake up with a upset tummy and a headache, but by the time I get up, get on the bus and work for an hour I'm fine. No more stuck in bed for a day cuz I drank an extra few shots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt makes me sad admitting all these things, but I also feel good getting it off my shoulder, before I used to skirt around the truth, I would find an excuse why I lost my job, that it wasn't all my fault, or I would say that I excersize a few times a week to not make it seem so bad to others, but I FINALLY realized that doing that also didn't make it seem bad to me either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven on the internet to complete strangers I feel bad sharing everything, but I need help. Do I want it right now? No, my life may suck, but something about being lazy and doing nothing is easy. I don't have to get up in the morning, I dont have to do this, I can play games and get high all day, whatever it is. But its just making my life harder, worse and more unhealthy. If I got help and changed I would probably get back in shape, and even though not drinking sounds impossible to me, I would probably be so much happier sober. Either way it can't be worse that it is right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut how do/can I get help? I don't believe I'm bad enough for rehab but maybe I am? How do I find info on that kind of thing, how do I pay for it? I have no money, I have 300 in my bank account, lots of debt, and not a penny of savings. Should I seek help in a different manner, talking to a counselor or therapist or go to AA meetings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way I have to tell my family. I don't want to tell them before they leave because they are so excited, but I don't like holding it in. As of this very second, my plan is to wait until they get home, tell them everything about my lifestyle and my drinking and smoking and that I need help, and I don't know where/how to do that. I don't know how well that will go down, they may accept it, or they may get upset and tell me I have to go down that road on my own, then I'm stuck with nowhere to go, no car and a 17 year old cat.",

    "content": "A lot happened one after another past two years, non-stop.\nSomeone I could basically call my blood-sis who thought me everything I knew while growing up (I am a boarding student so I didn\u2019t have my family with me most of the times, instead, she was there. We were from same hometown, and had so much in common in terms of our various ideological sights), who I opened up to about everything I needed assistance on from questioning my sexuality to some self-destructive obsessive behaviors, was accused of physically abusing one of my classmen and was therefore labeled as a \u2018devil\u2019. We talked only once ever since: I told her that I missed her and she told me that I shouldn\u2019t be seen with her because it wouldn\u2019t be good for my reputation. She graduated a little after that. Since then, I called her many times, but she never turned my calls. I wish she gave me an explanation for what exactly happened, cuz it is still impossible to believe that she did such thing.\nOnly a month after, one of my closest friends stopped talking to me all together. We had been actively fighting for over a month then but not for a particular reason mostly. He wasn\u2019t in a good place in his life and was behaving in a neglective (which was actually acceptable for me but) also sadly constantly aggressive way which deeply devastated me as I genuinely loved him. He told me that the reason why he wanted me out of his life was the guilt of upsetting me and that he didn\u2019t want to deal with it at the time. I was never angry, just big time upset cuz I needed him, as my close friend.\nThe particular reason why I needed him that much is that it was around the same time when my depressive symptoms were getting stronger. \nAt the same period of time, another one of my close friends (as she was in the room right next to mine and thus we spent lots of time together) was also accused of being a pathological liar, which was based on the latest discovery that her big time tragic past (I won\u2019t go into detail here) was in fact a lie. I also learnt that she talked behind everyone\u2019s back including me, telling huge lies. It was a big hit as well, I had real hard time processing all those new information. \nWhen the summer break was over and we were back school (which correspondingly means dormitory), the first term went in a blur but in a sucky way.\nMy grandmother got real sick and went into coma for two weeks. She had strong alzheimer for around two years back then, and therefore she had completely forgotten who I was towards the end. We never had a good relationship, as she was never a kind person and was always excessively and needlessly harsh on my mother, which made me so furious I cannot even tell. But still, seeing her that vulnerable and needy, made my stomach sick. What hit me more was that my mother was the person who took care of her literally every single need during her last nearly four years, despite how awful she treated her. Although I thought that I had my reasons not to love her, I still couldn\u2019t silk off the guilt of never even once creating a good memorable moment with her. All I had was how much I resented her. After those two weeks, she went out of coma and doctors said she was doing better, which only made it worse for us when she suddenly passed away a few days later. I cannot forget how painful it was when my mom woke me up at five in the morning telling me that she was gone. Even though I never felt like I loved her, it shaked me to my core. I never got to say sorry for the times I had been an ass to her, and I was never going to have the chance to ever again.\nAfter she passed, I factually didn\u2019t get out of my bed for the rest of the semester. I went to school by obligation, as they kicked us out of the dorm if we didn\u2019t, and as soon as the lessons were finished, I turned back to my bed right away and slept till next morning. \nTill later in next semester, I didn\u2019t seek for help from anyone except for my best friend, who couldnt be much of a help as he was not an adult or a therapist after all. I spent at least five months rotting in my bed, sometimes eating literally nothing for five or six days. I lost lot of weight and was visibly emaciated.\nI finally opened up to my brother after he had to come pick me up in the middle of the night when I blacked out because of high dose alcohol. He suggested me to start seeing a psychiatrist and as so I did. In my third session, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and started using antidepressants. \nI had a freshman boy who I met at the beginning of the first term. We were extremely close, as he reminded of myself in terms of social issues. He was a soft-hearted boy, who always tried to understand people and tried to be as kind as possible to everyone around him. Yet, I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself back then and therefore was so afraid of him being emotionally too attached to me. So, after making sure that he was in a better place mentally and also after he got a real nice girlfriend who was his former best friend too, I placed a great distance between us. Unfortunately, he apparently was already top attached to me. He was totally great, didn\u2019t even mind that I placed that distance, till he and his girlfriend started having issues. Only a week after I started using pills, I\u2019m guessing that they had a huge fight and he started threatening me via texting implying that he would commit suicide. He talked in a way blaming me, telling me that I already had lots of friends and freshman lil-brothers and sisters apart from him and therefore wouldn\u2019t give a damn about him being gone anyway. He texted me all night, stopping for a while but starting again at six in the morning. I cannot stress enough how terrified I was, because I knew how mentally unstable he used to be. I felt like throwing up. \nThe day after these happened, I met a former good friend of mine whose judgement I trusted, in order to get it at least a bit off my chest. Yet, he dragged me into a bar, in which people I definitely did not want to hang out with, saying that it will be good for me to take my mind off all that. I wanted to leave but it was too late to go back to dorm, and I didn\u2019t have any place else to crash except for a girl there that I knew before, who I thought was actually a nice girl. There, one of the former close friends of one of my most trusted friends sexually harassed me, touching and kissing me my without my consent. \nEveryone was pretty drunk except for me and didn\u2019t notice a thing. Or did and kept quiet idk. I felt awful and harshly insisted on leaving, finally persuading that girl into leaving.\nI couldn\u2019t say anything to anyone. I avoided seeing all people on that person and never saw any of them except for the guy who took me there ever again. \nAfter then I met a guy and things were going pretty smoothly for the first three weeks. Yet, for the following nine months, he became my nightmare as it was an extremely emotionally abusive relationship in which he used me physically (by lying to me telling that he loved me only to tell me that he lied two days after)  as well. \nDuring summer break, I had to quit using antidepressants as my parents didn\u2019t know a thing. I literally slept through the break except for a few weeks, not getting out of my bed 20 hours a day (except for the 4 hours my parents were home so that they wouldn\u2019t not worry and get suspicious). \nDuring the first term, my depression was worse than ever. I physically harmed myself in various ways. I was on the very edge.\nWe had to put a distance between with me best friend in the whole world, who was with me nearly every day for the last three years, as it became a point where my self-destructive behaviors were so hard to ignore and therefore mentally drained him. I was the one telling him that he should stay away from me, because I knew that he loved me way too much to ask for distance himself. \nI changed my medicine. I was back to sleeping through my days.\nI cut all my contact with that abusive guy permanently towards the end of the first term. However, after I was fed up and done with all his shit and went full no-contact, he told people about our relationship in a completely cropped way in which he cut off all the abusive stuff he had done. Thankfully, people didn\u2019t believe him and asked me how it actually happened (I didn\u2019t tell anyone apart from my close circle about the things he did because I didn\u2019t find it ethical to do so (I did tell him about the people I told and he himself said that it was okay and that he didn\u2019t even in fact had the right to tell me not to)).\nYet, what hurt most was that one of the first people he told his lies was one of my closest friends, who actually knew about the first six months from my point of view and was furious at him for that at the time. I later on learnt that she fueled him into bursting out on me (which he did the next day yelling me that I convinced him that he was faulty as well for the past two months (I politely asked him to elaborate which he refused once again yelling me how much of an awful person I was)). She apparently also shared some real sensitive and private things about me on that very table, which she couldn\u2019t deny doing when I asked her about all I heard. \nOnly a day after I confronted her, another one of my thought-to-be closest friends sent me a long paragraph issuing that I didn\u2019t try to get better and therefore didn\u2019t heal intentionally and that I didn\u2019t acknowledge other people\u2019s problems enough. \nI know that none of you know me irl, so all I can ask is for you to trust my words. I honestly am trying my best to be a truly good person. In fact, the main reason why my mdd have gotten this far is my obsession over being a \u2018perfectly good person\u2019. I feel unimaginably guilty even when I close the tap a few seconds late while brushing my teeth, as it is harmful for the environment. I say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 excessively lot in my personal life because I value every little thing I do as well as people do for me. \nConsidering these infos, I think you could at least guess how painful it was for me to read that message. It hurt my heart so bad thst I couldn\u2019t even move for like ten minutes, blankly staring at the wall. \nIn terms of depression, I am doing way better than the beginning of this semester. Especially ever since I told my parents about some of the stuff I had been going through, it has been easier to communicate with them, as I don\u2019t have as much thing to hide as I used to. \nDuring all this stuff, I have been fighting for my life with IBDP as well. Exams, ias, essays, homework\u2019s, extra-curricular and so on.\nThankfully, I made real good friends during this period and thanks to them, im not all alone in this. I actually have lot of sincerely meaningful and deep friendships, as I am an social-butterfly and normally (when depression factor is off) a cheerleader.\nYet, they are as inexperienced and young as I am. They are only teenagers and I cannot be such a huge burden on their shoulders. Being there for a mentally-ill person is not easy I know that and therefore I hardly ask for help. \nI am so exhausted. I still try to keep up with my social and academic life as active as possible so that I wouldn\u2019t regret it in the future. I push myself towards my limits I swear but all these are too much even for me. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Everything here that reminds me of all these disgusts me. My bed, my room, school, my classroom, the refectory, my desk, even my clothes disgust me. I have completely lost my appetite, I cannot eat anything unless I really force myself. I don\u2019t feel alright at all, I\u2019m physically in pain as well as mentally. All I want is to sleep and not wake up. \nPlease help me. How am I supposed to overcome all these? How can I feel better? How can I not want to throw up? ",

    "content": "I don\u2019t speak to my roommate anymore (both F20). Let\u2019s call her Jen.\n\nTLDR: My roommate and I (both F20) were close freshman year, lived separately sophomore year, then roomed together junior year. Things were fine at first, but our schedules stopped overlapping naturally, her boyfriend was over constantly, and around October I spiraled into severe depression and social anxiety due to relationship issues. I isolated heavily, stopped using social media, and unintentionally pulled away from her. Now, hearing her in shared spaces triggers a fight-or-flight response, and I avoid leaving my room even for basic needs. We barely speak anymore; she did not respond to my last text before break, and I feel like I ruined the friendship and cannot exist comfortably in my own apartment.\n\nFULL STORY:\nWe met freshman year when my roommate and I were looking for suite mates. We clicked immediately and were very close all year. We hung out almost daily and never had any conflict. Sophomore year, we lived separately (me on campus, her off campus) but stayed in touch through classes and social media.\n\nJunior year, she asked to room together on campus and I was genuinely excited. We talked all summer, set boundaries, and planned decor. The first month was fine. Then our schedules stopped naturally stopped lining up and our conversations felt repetitive, and she also started having her boyfriend over almost every day, which made me uncomfortable since she complained about him all the time and I grew to dislike him, so I kept to myself more in my room. \n\nAround October, I spiraled mentally after some relationship issues and fell back into a deep depression. I barely left my room except for work and the gym, stopped using social media, and isolated from everyone. I know I pulled away first, but I was genuinely struggling and couldn\u2019t even help myself. She kept living her life, which I don\u2019t blame her for, but I did feel some quiet resentment.\n\nToo wordy for Reddit\nM\n\nI don\u2019t speak to my roommate anymore  (both F20). Let\u2019s call her Jen. \n\nWe met the Spring before my freshman year when me and my freshman year roommate were searching for two other girls to be our suite mates. We both had a weird chronically online vibe and clicked immediately. Jen was actually a micro influencer and had many wild stories to share about that. We got along really well our freshman year, and never had any conflict during the time we lived together. We were close and hung out almost all very day! \n\nSophomore year, most students move into an off campus apartment due to limited spacing for upperclassmen. My parents wouldn\u2019t allow me to stay off campus, so I had to apply for on campus housing. The 3 other girls I stayed with moved into an off campus apartment with another girl. I had a random roommate for my on campus housing, which I was fine with since I got my own room, but I was excited to meet someone new and make memories like freshman year. However the complete opposite happened, after I shared my number and socials via email, she only added me on Instagram. Throughout the semester, we barely even talked and I saw her probably once or twice a month, having awkward \u201cHi, Bye\u201d conversations. I think the longest convo we had was after I got back from smoking w33d with my brother and I was high asf and had awkward small talk. She was kind though and graduated that semester! For the Spring semester, same situation. Barely saw each other, barely talked , even though we lived under the same room and shared the same common space. Granted she was a healthcare worker and spent a lot of time at her job and stayed somewhere closer to her job most nights. I primarily stayed in my room 90% of the time due to struggling with severe depression, which trickled into my junior year. However, Jen and I kept in contact still due to having classes together and via social media. \n\nJunior year, Jen wanted to room with me on campus and I was so excited!!! Finally a friend and someone I know I can make memories with. She was having problems with one our old roommates which ended in a messy friendship breakup. I was advised not to take sides, but I naturally talked to Jen more. We talked a lot over the summer about decoration plans and even established healthy boundaries with each other to prevent any conflict. Mind you, I am a cordial and cooperative person, and hate to cause/be involved in any conflict or drama. The first month of living together was fine. She spent a lot of time in our kitchen and living room and I joined her from time to time, but then not at all. Our conversations became pretty repetitive (same gossip / stories). I developed a routine with my busy class / work / extracurricular / gym schedule and not getting back until 9. She was an early bird and was in bed before 9, so I stopped seeing her at night.  \nShe started inviting her boyfriend over a lot (like everyday) and they would hang in the kitchen. I felt uncomfortable because she would (rightfully) talk shit about him all the time, yet had him here every day. I didn\u2019t want to give him any of my energy so I kept my distance. \n\nIn the middle of October, I regressed back into my depressive ways slowly after being taken advantage of by my ex and dealing with an emotionally abusive \u201cbf\u201d at the same time. I was confused abt how I let myself get in those situations and started to lose the confidence I built up after my deep depression. My social anxiety became an all time high, and I only left my apartment for work (and some reason gym) at this point. I stayed in my room all day most days either gaming, spiraling, getting high, or forcing myself to sleep through my agonizing thoughts. \n\nI stopped using social media and became distant from all my friends since I wasn\u2019t keeping up or leaving my apartment. I know I pulled away first, but I was struggling hard, and couldn\u2019t even get help for myself. I was in my room wishing I was dead and that my roommate would finally notice that I haven\u2019t left my room in 2+ days. But she kept going. Not blaming her, but I felt slight resentment. \n\nI know she would send me reels on Instagram, that hasn\u2019t been opened since October. I just genuinely cannot handle using Instagram or TikTok without spiraling (genuine trigger for me). She posts often on both platforms ( and so did I ) so I expect why she probably thinks I ignore her. I do respond to all her texts however, probably not timely because I freak out over what to say. \n\nHere\u2019s the agoraphobia part. Not saying I have it, because I make genuine connections online, and I am comfortable with my family, but when I hear my roommate in the common area from inside my room, my body goes into fight or flight mode. Let\u2019s say I need to use the bathroom, and I hear her in the kitchen making food. I spend at least 5 minutes at my door overthinking about how I should leave my room. Trying to get the \u201cperfect\u201d timing right. It feels like a ticking time bomb. Hesitating leaving my room for simple tasks because I hear my roommate. I don\u2019t understand why. I have nothing against her truly. But I somehow feel the need to avoid her and stay in my room 25/8. As a gamer, I game into late late hours, often until she wakes up at 6am and I\u2019m pretty sure she knows I\u2019m a loser for that. \n\nBy the time November snd December rolled around, it\u2019s been minimal contact. We spoke like twice this month and she made a comment about how she\u2019s gonna see me in 5 days. I sent her a text saying I left to go home for break and I received no response. I might have fucked up our relationship. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the possible agoraphobia (I don\u2019t think I have it, but just curious) part. I hear her in the kitchen or common area, my body goes into full fight-or-flight. I will stand at my door for minutes trying to time when it is \u201csafe\u201d to leave just to use the bathroom or get water. I do not hate her. I do not even dislike her. But I feel an intense urge to avoid her and stay in my room constantly. It feels irrational and exhausting.\n\nBy November and December, we barely spoke to each other. She made a comment about how she will \u201csee me in 5 days or something\u201d. I later texted her that I left for break and she never responded. Now I feel like I completely ruined the friendship, and I do not know how to exist comfortably in my own apartment anymore.\n",

    "content": "I 18(F) have an older brother 20(M) who recently brought home a new gf. Anyways, I\u2019ve heard horrible things about the GF since high school (so 4 years I\u2019ve known about her existence) ranging from her cheating, to sleeping around, dumping guys, not having female friends thanks to her talking poorly about them, using my brother as a tool for when her bfs dump her to fall back on and cry to/drive her around, blocking me on insta before I met her back when her and my brother were talking, etc... So fast forward to now they started dating and he brought her home. I don\u2019t like her but I feel my silence has been very good. I\u2019ve been away at university and was gonna come back for the holiday to get a break when during my exams I had found out she had gone into my bedroom and posted a photo of herself holding my very expensive collectable. I found out via a mutual sending me a pic asking if that was my bedroom since they used to sleep over a lot. So I\u2019m very angry because I don\u2019t like when people enter my room, touch my stuff etc.. (I have OCD I didn\u2019t tell my parents they don\u2019t believe in it, I\u2019m also severely depressed both diagnosed but they said when I\u2019m depressed it\u2019s all in my head etc..).  \n\nI tell my mom and about the things I know about the gf and how she introduced him to weed and other various things very early on and say I\u2019m worried about him and that I just don\u2019t want her in the house when I\u2019m home and to lock my bedroom. She talks to both of them. The GF gives some sob story about her life and family, how she\u2019s neglected blah blah and my mom doesn\u2019t speak up about going in my room and touching my stuff, makes an excuse for them and says she\u2019s welcome over anytime. \n\nA few days past and I\u2019m home. I\u2019ve been ignoring my brother the past few days and I had to call him to pick me up from a friends place because I couldn\u2019t afford an uber and my mom said he had to pick me up. His girlfriend was in the car and I had asked earlier if he\u2019d drop my friend off since she lived near so my friend gives him some dessert from the party thanks him and gets to her place. Then when we started turning to go to our house I can\u2019t hold it in I say I need to talk to them. So I start saying I don\u2019t like people in my room or touching my things especially things I paid for or was gifted. Then I start yelling because I\u2019m tweaking out because he\u2019s clearly not listening. He says I have an ego boost ever since I moved and got a job. Then I explode I don\u2019t even remember what I said to him but I told him he smells like shit, he smokes shit, he doesn\u2019t study etc\u2026 Right when we get back before I get out I tell his gf who\u2019s in the car to take down the photo she posted in my room. He opens the window and says he\u2019s gonna kill me. So I say I\u2019m gonna kill both of them and I hope she gives him whatever STD she has since she\u2019s probably cheating on him.  \n\nThat\u2019s about it. Since then I\u2019ve locked myself in my room shaking with anger. My own family doesn\u2019t protect me or side with me it\u2019s been like that my whole life I\u2019d be better off if I was the only child and male or I wasn\u2019t born. My mom texted me saying there\u2019s something wrong with me and I need help (help that I begged for in high school when I was self harming that she refused btw). I don\u2019t want help anymore I\u2019m really lost I don\u2019t have much to live for I think I\u2019m only alive to save my friends the burden of finding out I\u2019m dead and having to leave school to attend my funeral. I wish they cared. I wish my brother took care of me the way I\u2019ve helped him all these years. I wish my mom would look my way and think that my struggle is worth it and that I\u2019ve had a hard life too. Maybe I should start drugs\u2026 \n\nGoodbye, sorry for the bad grammar I\u2019m still tweaking. :)",

    "content": "\nLike most children nowadays, I had access to interent since i was younger around 7 years old.\n\nI used to play barbie games and sometimes I tried to connect to msn back then but my mom quickly told me to not use that site and I never have because I was a good kid.\n\nUnfortunately when I turned 9, I remember a school teacher once told us about one of my classmates who watched \u201cnasty\u201d things on the internet. I remember how she described it even telling us that one of her brothers worked at a club as a chef. How the used to cooked bra and underwear. Her exact words. It could meant anything and I remember it vividly because why the fuck would u tell things like that infront of a bunch of 9yo kids as a teacher teaching religious subject in a religious school?? But of course we didnt understand how wrong that was and I remember that kid was grinning as if he was proud as she describes the things he watched.i dont even know how she found out\u2026\n\nSo after that incident, I went home and looked up \u201cboobs\u201d \u201cpeople having sex\u201d on youtube (LOL lowkey thank god i never thought of looking it up directly on google) and that was also when I started learn how to touch myself\u2026 thanks a lot to the teacher we had for introducing us to nasty things at the age of 9\n\nFast forward, as i grew older around the age of 13, I started to go into chatrooms but I was still scared of doing things people tell me to do (send a pic of myself/my body etc) also because i was weirded out at that time like why would these older guys (i only talked to people around my age at that time) wants to talk to me like that? \n\nSo i stumble across this one chatroom meant for teens when i was around 14, met a bunch of creepy people but I was reluctant to do anything yet but i also dont really remember how i started to foolishly follow some random men instructions on the internet.\n\nBut i will tell you about 2 men that really fucked me up mentally and emotionally. I dont really want to go into details because in a way it upsets me\u2026\n\nSo I met this guy when I was 14 and he claimed to be around 15/16, we talked a lot and we seemed to get along together so we started to date online. During that time ive never seen him on cam but he would send me selfies and i get some users telling me hes a an old man but I didnt believe it, im not trying to play it off but when u were a teen u think everyone is against u or just wanna sabotage u because of jealousy or something so thats why i never believed it and run away. And i was dumb so of course i went along with his ridiculous reasons on why he cant cam because the reasons also seemed believable to me at that time. \nWe did things (you know what) he sent me a picture of his dick, i got on cam and did things he told me to (what a fucking idiot i was). He also told me how to finger myself. \nFast forward, i was so deeply in delusion that we were in love. I mean this guy talk about marrying me and having kids? U can only say those things to the person u love right? Love always seems so powerful and undeniable when u are that young.\nBut i kept pushing him to show himself. Long story short after multiple reasons he finally told me why he didnt want to, its because i will hate him.\nI didnt get why. We were in love. I would never leave him even if hes ugly and insecure of himself. I didnt like myself either. \nWell he did.\nAnd imagine the horror i felt.\nOn the cam is someone who looked like he could be my grandpa.\nBut i didnt leave. And judge me all u want but i was a kid i was around 15 and i didnt know how wrong that was. Nobody really ever talk to me about stranger on the internet danger and back then nobody really talk abt grooming as much as they do now so i didnt know i was talking to a pdf files.\nSo we went along and he told me the selfie he sent me was of his own kid. Idk how true that was but it is so fucking sick to even say something like that. \nBut hey at least the dick pic was real \n\nI dont really know how to talk about the next part but i wanna talk about what he did to me because the pdf who grooms children and have cp u read about could be literally among u, it could even be your dad\u2026\nI remember he used to tell me to flash him while he was literally out in public, him jerking off in the toilet of his campus while i can hear other people around, he told me to flash his workers.\nI remember being on a family trip one time and i was sharing a room with my younger brother and while my brother was sleeping he keep telling me to do nasty things but i couldnt because even i knew how fucking weird and nobody should do that especially not with my literally baby brother in the same room\nAnd he was involved in field of work where hes helping other people. How fucking sick is that? The person whos helping u could actively be involved with kids sexually? He is also a dad\u2026 \nBut that wasnt all, he had pictures of other kids in the chatroom showing him things but at that time i treated it the way someone who got cheated on not what a fucking creep why would u have a tons of pictures like that of kids??? He also had me put on lingerie that belonged to my mom\u2026\n\nBut here is whats the worst he did to me\u2026\n\nHe introduced me to another pdf file.\nWho was also in a relationship with another kid, a year or two younger than me. We did things together. All for four of us. Sometimes 3 of us. They even wanted me to watch how the other guy make her do things and how obedient and a good s\u2014- she was. What the fuck.\n\nAnd i cannot fucking accept how the fuck was that possible? How the fuck do these people continues their life? How can they do that TO KIDS???\nIt really fucked me up and it makes me angry and it also the reason why I cant have kids because i cannot bare the thoughts of my kids crying and doing things to themselves  for a fucking creep and thinking that it was love and they had to do that to makes someone happy?? And i dont want to bring kids in a world where we just cannot stop hearing cases of kids being groomed and SA even for a day\n\nTo this day its still not something i can ever talk to anyone about. Is it shame? No i dont think so. I guess talking it out loud would be like me admitting it really did happened to me and i was groomed and admitting that i actually met and been with people like that and i was too fucking stupid to leave because why? Love apparently. I was already depressed but when it hits me what they did to me and what the fuck is wrong with this world and how could a dad do that to another child??? It really really fucked me up and alters my view of the world and people.\n\nSo please please please im begging u MONITOR ur kids activity on the internet please. My parents did that to me but they never actually look as if theyre scared that their child might actually being groomed so its better to not actually look.\n\nAnd i know my mom sort of knew what happened because she noticed that her lingeries were moved or misplaced and im positive she read my chat with my groomer at some point because she talked about how would i feel if she call my dad what i called my groomer and i know it wasnt coincidence but it never went anywhere anyway\n\nIm not blaming her. I understand its scary and its a hard thing to talk about but oh how i wish so so badly she did something to protect me from further damage.\n\nSo please dont ever be scared to talk about internet grooming and pdf files with your kid. I understand its not an easy topic but it is really really important for their growth.\n\nBut heres a good ending, the girl reported the guy who i was introduced to to the police. Im not really sure what happened to him now but i knew he got arrested and waiting to be sentenced the last time i talked to him until i cut off communication all together\n\nWell to end this i wanna say, i hope all pdf files gets the worse in life and in death :)\n",

    "content": "almost four years have passed since all of this happened. people say that time heals, but\u2026 this wound will remain open until i the very end. until I die. what they really mean by \u201ctime\u201d is getting used to it. I\u2019ve learned to live with this,it has become a part of me,but it hasnt gone anywhere. I cant return to this topic without tears, which is why writing this is so difficult for me. It may sound like a clich\u00e9,but\u2026 love your family and cherish every second you spend with them.\n\nI mentioned earlier that this happened four years ago. My brother was applying to university in Turkey that time. He was 16\u2014two years younger than everyone else applying alongside him. I was proud of him,even when he wasnt proud of himself. he didnt get the score he expected,and for days on end he thought of nothing but getting into university. that entire summer passed in waiting. Every new day began with him checking his phone,hoping to see good news. those news never came\u2014at least not until it was too late.\n\nusually,responses are released at the beginning or middle of August,like almost everywhere else. Even though he knew this,he was losing his mind,even if he didnt show it. he could deceive everyone\u2014everyone except me. from the very beginning,we had an unusual bond,one that no one else seemed to have. I am four years younger than him,but the difference between us was insane. he was far older than his years,strikingly different from his peers.\n\nmy brother loved in such a\u2026 unique way. his love was all-consuming,wrapping itself around your entire body,your entire soul. my mom used to tell me that even as a kid,he\u2019d spend days caring for me when I was little,protecting me,doing things many people never would. I admit,sometimes we fought,but he never used even a bit of excessive force,treating it all like a game\u2014even when I took everything seriously. he was way wiser than his age. and I was just a little girl who thought he did all of that out of hatred toward me. I was just a silly girl. it took me a lot to realize that.\n\nits strange how events happen suddenly,one after another. the law of fate\u2014something I hate more than anything else. august was about to end,and he kept saying that many of his friends and acquaintances had already been accepted. Every word spoken on the topic made him flinch,and I felt it. He lied flawlessly when he wanted to hide his feelings,because by nature he was calm,while I was his complete opposite. yet, I sensed it\u2014in the slightly raised voice with which he kicked me out of his room,in the nervous way he played with his phone case,in the chaotic rhythm he tapped out on the table. he complained of chest pain and weakness,but my mom said it was because of stress\u2014and she was right. everything that happened later happened because of stress.\n\nhe woke up one morning again complaining of chest pain,and my mom decided to take him to a doctor. the three of us got ready and went together. We shouldve done it earlier,but now thats far in the past\u2014nothing can be changed. Events happened so rapidly that it felt as though I was asleep,half-dreaming.\n\nThe MRI revealed something devastating\u2014an aortic aneurysm. I didnt fully understand what that meant back then,but now its meanings burned into my retina from the moment I googled it. the following few days again passed like a illusion -muffled conversations,his protests,pleas\u2026 He knew a lot about anatomy and medicine,and he looked as though he had been struck by lightning. sometimes people just dont understand the true meaning of that expression. lucky them. unfortunately,I learned it through personal experience. his eyes widened,and his body seemed to turn to stone. For several minutes he didn\u2019t blink,didnt react to me,to our mother,or to the doctor. to no one.\n\noerhaps the doctor made a colossal mistake by announcing the diagnosis in his presence. perhaps not. he read emotions on peoples faces like an open book. my mothers face would have given everything away in an instant. And then he wouldve grabbed me,forcing me to tell him what I had heard. and I wouldve told him, despite all my mothers pleas to stay silent. I trusted him more than my own mother.\n\nwriting is hard. my eyes fill with tears the moment I recall.\n\nthe surgery wasscheduled, but it was kept from him. even I didnt know anything. it had no effect anyway. he knew what and how\u2014he just didnt know when. he spent an incredible amount of time with me, talking and hugging me as if it were the last time. I was terrified. I would start trembling at every touch of his\u2014his hands were hot, like fire. I fell seriously ill a week before the surgery, merely existing through those days. fucking stress.\n\nthe day X arrived, and I gathered all my strength and will into my fist and went with them. by that time, he was already gray, his eyes expressing emptiness. I was deathly afraid of everything that was happening, and of the calm, almost lethal aura he radiated.\n\nbefore the surgery\u2014one day before it\u2014he hugged me incredibly tightly, pressing his chin into my shoulders with all his strength. he whispered, \u201cI love you more than anything in the world.\u201d and I felt moisture on my shoulder\u2014his tears. he pulled away, wiping his face. that was the first and last time I eve saw him cry.\n\nhe did the same with others\u2014but differently. with me, he tore off every mask he had ever worn. those words were spoken by his soul, not his mind.\n\nthe surgery was unsuccessful.\n\nthe next day, it turned out that he had been accepted into the university he wanted. as if destiny wasnt done making us suffer. fuck you,destiny.",

    "content": "I\u2019ve never really talked about it to anyone except my family or really close friends. But even then it\u2019s always been a watered down, emotionless conversation. Something that\u2019s there to inform people rather than have a conversation about it. I always got too emotional. This however is going to be the 10th Christmas without him, and I feel it\u2019s time for me to just let it all out for my own personal reasons. \n\n6th of March 2015. It was a Friday. I remember waking up for school at 7am thinking 1 more left until the weekend. I was lying in bed waiting to properly wake up when I heard a lot of voices downstairs, but i thought it was just the TV. Then my mam and dad came bursting into my room telling me that there are paramedics downstairs, Matthew is unwell and he needs to go to hospital. You might think this was a huge shock, but it wasn\u2019t. My brother Matthew was disabled with cerebral palsy, so in the last few years of his life he was in and out of hospital quite a lot. I assumed this was something to do with the reason he was in hospital only a week or two before this date. I got ready and looked downstairs to see two paramedics entering my brother\u2019s room. They took my brother into the ambulance right before i got a chance to see him and as they closed the door, I was already getting put into my uncles car where me and my little brother would be taken to school by my auntie and uncle, while my mam and dad went to the hospital. \n\nI went to school that morning in a bit of a downer, because i didn\u2019t really know what was going on, however i didn\u2019t think it would be too bad due to experiencing my brother being in and out of hospital so much. I went about my morning making sure I kept my mind occupied. I went to my morning lessons, stuck around my friends and waited until I got a text from my mam or dad telling me what was going on.\n\nLater on in the day I got pulled out of a classroom and taken to the main reception where my mam, dad and little brother were waiting. My little brother was also at the same school as me only a few years younger. I actually had in my hand an art project i\u2019d been working on. A Mexican death skull inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead, which was our theme for the term. I took it home on what felt like an hours long car ride which in reality took only 10 minutes. When I look back at it, the deafening silence along with the adrenaline rushing through my body as I thought of a million possibilities at the end of this journey made me feel like i was high. \n\nI got home and we sat in the front room. My dad sat on one couch with me while my mam was on another with my little brother. I could see my mam was crying. My dad had previously been crying but he has always been one to keep his emotions away from me and my brother, whereas i\u2019ve seen my mam cry over my brother quite a lot. And over other members of the family who have passed later on in life. My mam then explained that Matthew was extremely ill this morning. She checked his oxygen levels that morning due to him looking under the weather, lips slightly blue. Then thats when the paramedics were called. What happened next shook my life forever. \n\nMy mam looked directly into my eyes, through the tears that were drowning hers, and said \u201cMatthew died in the hospital, at 10:19 this morning\u201d. I then hugged my dad as i watched my little brother burst into tears. All four of us were broken into tears, knowing our life would never be the same and our family has been damaged forever. \n\nThe rest of our time in that house that day was a complete blur. The next thing i remember was leaving the house, going straight to my aunties where all my family were waiting. I saw my mam hug my uncle while i was sat in the car. Mam was crying so much I couldn\u2019t look anymore. My dad then parked up and we went inside. The echoing silence filled the room as one family member after another entered. I didn\u2019t say a word. I couldn\u2019t. I was so destroyed inside, the thought of making conversation was just not possible. We then talked about Matthew, talking about his life and trying to make our selves smile a bit more. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much more that day, other than going to my best friend\u2019s house and telling him what happened. Crying at his front door while ironically there was a man from the church talking to his dad. After an hour, I went home and knew I needed to take my mind off things. I went training that night because I couldn\u2019t bare to be in what felt like an empty house. My dad took me and told my coach what happened and that he\u2019d need to keep an eye on me. I remember sitting with two of the other kids my age there. One being a close friend at the time, and another being a girl I really liked, as well as being basically best friends with her. They asked me whats up as they could see my eyes watering up, then i told them that my brother died. I burst out crying. After it settled into them what I said, I got a hug from both. I finished the rest of my training session in silence. Constantly reminding my self that the day I had experienced was not a dream, it was real. I went home that night and went straight to bed, praying i\u2019d get some sleep. \n\nThat was the end of the day for me. It\u2019s been 10 years since and i\u2019ve constantly wanted to get it all off my chest but i\u2019ve never had the balls to say anything. All Christmas\u2019s since have been extremely hard. I\u2019ve not been able to find much Christmas spirit. But this year there are two beautiful babies who have been welcomed into the world and into the family which makes this the first Christmas since where I feel excited to see what the whole journey to Christmas day has in stock for our family. Instead of tears for the family members who aren\u2019t here, there will be laughs and smiles for the new additions to the family. \n\nI\u2019ve always had this empty space in my heart since the 6th of Match 2015 that hasn\u2019t been filled. I still have nightmares and sleepless nights about it, but I know one day i\u2019ll have that empty space filled with hopefully a family of my own. \n\nThis story isn\u2019t just for me to get some sort of release of sorts, but I hope it touches at least one other person who might be going through something similar, and they know that one day tears will turn into smiles.

    "content": "This is going to be very very long but all of the context is required. \n\nI (22F) had a strange codependent relationship with my high school history teacher. He was in his mid 30s, and I had him as a teacher for 3 out of my 4 years of high school. To be upfront, nothing sexual ever happened between us, but we did have moments of weird physical intimacy that were not overtly sexual. Also, I know I should seek therapy for this but for whatever reason, whether it be money or fear of having to verbally admit all of this, I haven't done it yet. \n\nIn high school, I was always in AP or accelerated classes. I was 1 year advanced in math and in 9th grade I enrolled in some pre-AP classes, including history. I immediately had a crush on my teacher because he was tall and very handsome, and seemed like a personable guy. Off the bat, he had a lot of affection for me and I would spend a lot of time in his classroom outside of our actual class time. I would go there after school for awhile every day and just talk with him. Because I was 15, I thought he was just a nice guy and since he had a daughter and son, I always assumed he was just taking on that sort of paternal role with me. \n\n  \nIt got slightly weirder in 10th grade, as he started getting a little more emotionally close to me. He would also hug me a lot, put his hand on my arm or back and sometimes even my leg. He would get randomly frustrated with me and say no to something simple, then a few minutes later would be kind and funny again. I started dressing a little provocatively for his attention. I blame it on the fact that the I watched the 1997 Lolita movie. I tried to emulate that style of dress. I was obsessed with him. I thought about him constantly, dreamed about him, fantasized about him, and I know it was so painfully obvious that I had this weird infatuation. He would joke with me and poke fun at me during class in front of all of the other students, who always reacted very awkwardly or irritatedly. I went to him with every problem I had, and I had pretty severe depression and anxiety at this point in my life. We would talk for an hour after school each day, and he told me a lot about his personal life and how he had struggled growing up because of his parents who hated each other. He had a lot of siblings from his dad's various escapades, and his mom constantly threatened to leave. I cried a lot and he would hold me. \n\nThat summer, he led the class on a trip abroad and on the first day he came in to my room and said he was doing room checks for everyone. I found out the next day that he hadn't done that. He checked in on the troublemakers and me, and he hadn't gone fully into anyone else's room. He did this at every hotel we stayed at, and once when I was rooming with a group of other girls, he came in and I had to hide in my bunk because I had just showered and was only in a towel. One day, he got very frustrated and lashed out at me because I kept expressing my anger at another one of the girls. But then he pulled me aside from everyone else and gave me his room number and told me that if I needed anything to come see him. I did around midnight and he let me in, and I just sat there and cried to him about something for a few hours. He just kept looking at me and I remember wanting something to happen, but it never did. After a bit of silence he told me to go to bed because I was falling asleep, but to come back at any time if I needed anything else. On a train ride, my friend and I were with the chaperones in a small car, and we were all looking out the window at something. I made a joke and when he laughed, he rested his forehead on my back. The last night abroad, he walked into the room I was sharing with a few other girls and was visibly drunk. He started going through our drawers and closets and even looked in our bathroom, mumbling something about how he was making sure we didn't have any alcohol or something. I told him to leave and he yelled at me. I think it was supposed to be funny but he was so loud that the boys who were roomed across the hall from us opened their door and asked what was doing on. \n\nWhen we got back from the trip, my parents made me attend some summer study sessions to prepare for a state test retake as they were mad I had only gotten an 80. He of course held the review sessions, and it was always just me and him. One time he took my phone jokingly, and I can't remember why. But he held it above his head and I had to get up on the desk to get it from him. I was basically all over him, and his hand was on my waist but another teacher walked in. He also went through some buzzfeed list of the most attractive male celebrities and asked me if I was attracted to them. \n\nJunior year, he got very physical with me, hugging me even more and paying a lot of attention to me during class. He would talk poorly about other students to me, and he had me sit at the desk closest to his. After school once, when I was standing at the front of classroom, he walked up behind me and put his arm around my front and hugged me to him. He had also started playfully saying \"love ya\" to me, and at one point told me I looked cute. When I wasn't getting attention from him, I was panicking and freaking out. I had to go home early all the time because I would get so anxious that I would start to shake and feel sick during his class. This happened every time he wasn't giving me individual attention, or if I thought he was mad at me. If I couldn't go home early, he would just write me a pass to go to the nurse and leave it on my desk. This year he also told me he loved me, and I figured it was in the \"platonic\" way he had done before, but be said he \"really truly loved\" me. Another time, I had smudged pen under my eye and he asked what happened, then reached for my face. I said it was nothing but he grabbed my wrists and made me stand in front of him while he touched my face, and then said it was just pen but he had thought it was a bruise. \n\nAs I said before, things got physically very weird during junior year. After class and after school, I would act out jokingly in order to get his attention. This involved me poking a lot of fun at him and then when he retaliated, saying I would beat him up. He would always egg me on and tell me to punch him. When I did, he would push me or fake hit me or something. On two occasions, he pushed me so hard that I fell into things: a chair, and the classroom radiator by the window where he stood behind me and kind of had me pinned there. Once, I ran at him and he moved out of the way at the last second, causing me to fall, but he reached out and caught me by my waist and just under my chest, and held me there for a moment before standing me up. \n\nSenior year I never saw him because I did the whole thing remote. Some other things that happened a lot that I can't place in a specific time frame are that he tickled me, kicked me, \"jokingly\" threatened to strangle or kill me, swore all of the time and called me the b-word (again, a \"joke\"), and took pictures of me. I say this was an emotional codependency because there was a lot of more complex emotional talks and events occurring beside the ones I mentioned above. I don't want to delve into all of the personal things that he told me, because there are so many. I know that he knew I was basically in love with him. I doubt myself a lot about whether he knew what he was doing to me, but I just think that if everyone else knew how I felt, then so did he. And he would not have hidden these weird interactions and behaviors from other students or teachers. I think I was one of the only people he could talk to, but he took advantage of how much I loved him and manipulated me, either doing things that made me feel special or taking out his misplaced anger. \n\nAll that is to say, I now have issues with every man I meet. I have a boyfriend of 3 years, and if he does things that remind me of my teacher, I get very uncomfortable and shut down. Every older man or male figure of authority in my life is an object of attraction and attachment. In college, I became unhealthily obsessed with every male professor I had. Now that I have a job, I am infatuated with my male boss, and that specifically has brought up a lot of old feelings and behaviors in my that I do not like seeing. I have had a lot of dreams recently about my teacher and it has been causing me a lot of distress. I have two friends that know about the whole thing. My boyfriend knows I was manipulated by a teacher, but I haven't shared specific details with him and I can't talk to him about this coming up because it would involved my feelings for my boss. It is very hard for me to do things without seeking the attention of older men. I can't even go to the store without trying to be seductive or cute to them, and it makes me feel gross but I also feel as if I can't help it. The only way I have controlled these behaviors is to separate myself from those situations. In college, I never attended office hours and would not really speak to the professors I had these unhealthy crushes on. But now I have a boss who I see nearly every day, and he is a very kind and good boss so he checks in and talks to me a lot just like he does everyone else. But I can't stay away from him like I could stay away from my professors. I am also always paranoid that every older man has bad intentions with me, whether I am attracted to them or not. \n\nI feel somewhat better after getting this all off of my chest. I have never spoken this in depth about this situation, but it's something that truly affects me every day even 4-5 years later. I still have dreams about my teacher and think about him all the time even though I haven't seem him since high school. He still teaches, and I know that some other teenage girl is probably in the same situation that I was. I hate that it makes me jealous. I know how much he has negatively affected me and my life but I was so attached to him, and honestly so in love with him, that I find it hard to not still want to be with him even though I hate him most days. \n\nIf you read this far, I'm honestly impressed and I'm glad I could get this off my chest and ease my anxiety at least a little. Sorry for the length. I am getting through it and I know I need therapy but saying everything out loud is scary. \n\nTL;DR weird relationship with high school teacher has made me obsess over every male authority figure in my life while simultaneously making me very uncomfortable around men.

    "content": "This might be a lengthy post and I don't know where to begin, so I'll go as far back as I can.\n\nI was born in England with 2 older siblings - a brother who is 2 years older than me, and a sister who is 6 years older. We share the same mother but different fathers. My parents relationship was dysfunctional at best, if I were to put it lightly. Both of them have their own trauma and horrible events in their upbringing that have made them who they are, for better or worse.\n\nWhen I was three months old, my father and mother abruptly split up one day, and he placed me on a flight to his home country while my mother was at work, and cut contact with them completely. There's a long, uncomfortable history with this that I have yet to find the answers for, because both sides are not going to give me the complete honest account of the events that transpired, but at the end of the day he took me away and cut the phone wire in the house so my sister (6) couldn't tell my mother what had happened until she arrived home. By then it was already too late to stop what happened.\n\nFast forward a few months; my mother pursued a case against my father in court for the kidnapping of me, but he surprisingly won. This is doubly shocking because he was a man who had prior convictions, and a history of drug abuse. I'm not sure if it's the system that made a mistake, or if my mother was visibly unstable, as she had her own demons too. I didn't come from the best stock unfortunately.\n\nI grew up an only child effectively, my dad had another daughter prior to me but she was very distant and grew up with her mother. I was raised knowing that I had a brother and sister, and had photos of them from that brief period we were together. My father, to his credit, never told me any bad stories about my mother growing up - he always maintained that they both did things wrong, and always hoped I would have a relationship with her and my siblings.\n\nWhen I was 9, I created a Facebook account and through sheer force of will was able to find her account, and finally reconnected with my mother. My mother married another man, had another daughter, and moved halfway across the world. Things are hazy from this period since it was so long ago, but she did try to organise trips for me to visit but my father had his concerns and declined. She was able to come and visit me when I was 11, when I had my confirmation over here. She was here for 2 weeks or so, and had to cut her trip short because of my sister getting attacked by a dog. My father doesn't believe that happened, and holds resentment still for her leaving early. I don't remember if it happened or not.\n\nFast forward a year, and we had to drop my sister off to the airport as she was doing charity work near Chernobyl. Who did we run into at the airport, but my mother? She came over to see friends that she had in the capital, but never mentioned it to me or my dad. My dad was disgusted, naturally, as one would have hoped she would have wanted to come see me after all these years.\n\nI developed a strong relationship with my brother through Facebook and our shared interests in music. My youngest sister had a very keen interest in me, and we also had a strong relationship. The kind where she pings you on MSN nonstop if you didn't reply immediately. Annoying? Sure. But for someone who never had siblings growing up, it felt like the right kind of interaction from a much younger sister. My older sister messaged me sometimes, but we never had a bond like I had with the other two. She was certainly more aloof than them, and I always chalked it up to her having her own life, as well as teenage hormones and all that fun stuff. I would receive messages from my mother and siblings sometimes who would update me on her life, and I could tell she was in a bad place - often she would be in an abusive relationship, and would sometimes be hospitalised on account of them assaulting her, or her having mental breakdowns.\n\nWhen I turned 18 and acquired a passport my mother paid for a flight for me and my partner to make the long trek over to them, and finally meet my other family. We arrived at the airport, and had a very emotional embrace with one another. My older sister went to the bathroom for some time, and we went back to her apartment for some festivities. As I expected, my time was mostly taken up with the other two siblings I had made contact with. We stayed in the country for 3 weeks, and had a great time bonding and catching up on time lost. My oldest sister only saw me twice during this trip; at the beginning when we arrived at the airport, and at the end, when we departed the airport. I held a lot of resentment towards her for not seeing me more often during this trip; my mother had family nights planned where we all went out to dinner, but she never showed up, nor did she message me during my stay. I felt like a pariah, and knew that no matter how hard I try to piece things together, they would never be as they once were. I would always be the brother who was lost.\n\nYears go by, and my relationship with the big brother and younger sister deepen more. He moves to England, as does my older sister, and I visit him and he vice versa. I try visiting her, but she cancels at the last minute. My older sister and I only have surface-level conversations - happy birthday, miss you, hope you're doing well etc. Nothing develops past this stage. She gets engaged, and has a baby boy. Despite the distance, I'm so proud of her and how well she's doing in life. Unfortunately things go sour, and she moves away with her son, back halfway across the world, due to his fathers abusive behaviour towards her.\n\nShe and I didn\u2019t speak much for a long time after that. Messages were rare; a few check-ins here and there, always warm but never deep. I figured that was just how things would stay. Life moved on. I focused on work, friends, and my own growth. She raised her son and built her world around him. We existed on opposite sides of the planet, quietly aware of each other, but never really together. Then, earlier this year, everything changed. My mother got engaged to another man, and invited all of us to the wedding. It was the first time in over a decade that we\u2019d all be in the same place. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, part of me was excited, part of me braced for another cold shoulder.\n\nWhen I finally saw my sister again, there was something different. We didn\u2019t talk - not much at first, just exchanged polite smiles and hugs, watched the ceremony, had a few drinks. But later that night, my siblings and I were outside drinking together quietly. My sister addressed the elephant in the room and said, as the older sibling, she has a responsibility to talk to me about things. We quietly go away from the crowd and start talking - really talking, for the first time in our lives.\n\nShe began by telling me that not a day went by that she didn't miss me. The day I left is a very vivid memory that's haunted her throughout her life. She was terrified of my dad - he's an intimidating person, admittedly, and by her account \"everything a woman wants in a man; tall, dark and handsome\". I physically resemble my dad, and seeing me that day at the airport brought out unresolved trauma that she didn't realise was buried deep deep down, and festered. She feared for my safety constantly, worried that something might happen to me as a child. Her trip to the bathroom was, in actuality, a panic attack, brought on by the sight of me. She told me for much of my trip that she lay awake at night, crying herself to sleep, unable to bring herself to see me, and all of the pain that came from that night long ago that was awakened by my presence. She apologised, constantly, that she was a \"sucky sister\", and wants to make things better this time around. Having a child forced her to look back on her life, and the pain she's carried, and it's made her look at things differently. She also has been diagnosed with BPD and Bipolar Disorder, so this would track with her behaviour previously.\n\nWhen it came for me to speak, I tried to be stoic, and said that I couldn't mourn a life I never lived. Foolish, I know, and so terribly wrong. I told her that I know there's a universe out there where we got to grow up together, and it breaks my heart that this isn't it. Even now, typing that has sent me into a fit of tears, tears I couldn't cry that night.\n\nWe met once more before I had to leave, and embraced tightly. She reiterated everything she said that night, that she loves me, and that she's sorry for the distance between us. I froze, I could barely get out anything more than \"thanks for the talk.\" and \"I love you\". The day I left was awful. I never had this strong attachment to this other side of my family, and only now do I realise that as a child I buried my strong sense of yearning towards them, and only now it's starting to come up. It's difficult to grow up alone, knowing that a part of you exists somewhere else, forever out of reach despite your dreams and wishes. She sent me a text when I was in the city, stating that she'd love to keep in touch when I've settled from travel. It broke me, completely. To know that I have a chance to have a relationship with my older sister, something I've longed for since I was knee high to a grasshopper.\n\nNow that I'm home, things have been difficult, and this is the crux of the post that's taken me so long to arrive to.\n\nI can\u2019t seem to stop thinking about her, about the years lost, the life that could\u2019ve been, the way everything between us feels both brand new and impossibly old at the same time. We've spoken often, and cried over text, explaining things in a way that's more comfortable perhaps, and every message from her means more to me than I can explain. But when a day goes by without hearing from her, my mind spirals. I know she\u2019s a mother, with a son who deserves all of her attention, and that her world is busy and full. Still, my heart struggles to understand that distance after finally closing a lifetime long gap.\n\nIt\u2019s strange. I finally have what I\u2019ve wanted for most of my life, and yet it hurts so much just to hold it. I look at her being a mum, living her life, and I feel so proud of her, but also this quiet ache that I\u2019ll never be as close as we could have been if we\u2019d grown up together. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve arrived too late to a story that\u2019s already halfway written. There's a bond she has with my brother, and younger sister, that I will never have, and it kills me to accept this.\n\nI'm mourning the time we lost; the annoying sibling rivalry, the ways in which we would grind eachothers gears, the funny things she would say when she comes home from school, how we could have sat in the sitting room or backyard for hours and not say a thing. I'm mourning all of the versions of her I didn't get to see; the annoying older sister, the angsty and brooding teenager, the aloof young woman. I've arrived at a midway point in her life, and there's an inexplicable, horrible void inside me that yearns for the years I've lost.\n\nI'm holding on to the little similarities that we have, everything that I can to cope with this feeling of being so distant; we both have black hair and blue eyes, neither of us have tattoos. It's like I'm hoarding every item and fact that can be used as a sentimental bond between us, even if it's only superficial. Anything that feels like proof that we are of the same blood, of some shared past.\n\nI\u2019m trying to remind myself that love doesn\u2019t have to make up for lost time, that it can still exist in the time we have left. She\u2019s made it clear she wants me in her life, and I\u2019m endlessly grateful for that. I just need to find a way to balance the gratitude with the grief.\n\nI guess I\u2019m posting this because I don\u2019t really have anyone else who understands what this kind of reunion feels like. The joy, the heartbreak, the confusion, all tangled together. I\u2019m so thankful for her, for the chance to finally know my sister beyond photographs and stories. But part of me still feels like a little boy, pressing his hands against the glass, watching the rest of his family live on the other side.",

    "content": "Every time she felt like she was losing an argument, she would come back to that day over and over again\u2014accusing me of cheating with a girl with whom I was just making a chocolate bouquet for her. It was a very serious accusation, and it really hurt me because it wasn't true.\n\n\n\nOver time, these constant accusations started to change me. I became more closed, irritable. If before I could keep silent when she accused me of something petty to avoid quarrels, then I couldn't accept this. It hurt very deeply.\n\n\n\nDespite everything, we talked every day until late at night. I often sent her gifts and money for no reason, just to make her feel cared for, because she lived alone in another city.\n\n\n\nOne day I found out that she went on a date with another guy. She was staying with her older brother, who lived in the city where she studied, and often spent time with her friends. We had a big fight. In the end, she confessed that she had actually gone on a date because she felt lonely.\n\nThe quarrel was long and very painful. And then she said she tried to hang herself.\n\n\n\nI was shocked. I didn't know if it was true or manipulation, but I was very scared. I immediately bought a plane ticket at night and flew to her place. While waiting for boarding, I found the contact of her neighbor or friend, called, explained the situation and asked to go check. She immediately went and texted that she was fine and would stay with her until I arrived.\n\n\n\nI arrived around 4 a.m., called my friend again, and she said that Nora was asleep and everything was fine. I rented an inexpensive hotel and stayed there until morning.\n\n\n\nI called Nora this morning. She sounded calm and cheerful. We agreed to meet. When I saw her, she acted as if nothing had happened: she was joking, smiling, laughing. It's like that night never happened.\n\n\n\nI didn't understand how this was possible. I didn't bring it up\u2014I just shut everything down.\n\n\n\nWe spent two days together: walking in the mountains, in the park, went to the zoo, because she loved animals. I paid for everything as usual. It took all my savings for that trip. I haven't been able to restore them since.\n\n  \nAfter that incident, I flew back, and for a while everything really became calmer. There were no tantrums, quarrels or serious scandals. But every time she got offended or angry, I flew to her anyway. I don't know why I did that, probably because I loved her too much.\n\n\n\nSix months later, I started having serious health problems, and I had to have surgery. Nora knew about it, but I didn't feel much support from her. On the day of the operation, the amount was announced to me \u2014 I was ready because I had saved money in advance. I even paid for housing and loans in advance so that there would be no problems afterwards.\n\n\n\nBut a week later, when I was discharged, it turned out that the amount had tripled. The initial cost included only the operation itself. The rest is medicine, treatment, food, and even cleaning of the ward. To pay for everything, I took out an online loan.\n\n\n\nAfter being discharged, I returned home. In the evening, friends came with their wives and children, 12-15 people gathered. Everyone was laughing, talking, and supporting me. And it was at that moment that Nora started to get hysterical again. I didn't even understand what caused it. I was after the hospital, weak, tired, and in pain\u2026\n\n\n\nAnd suddenly, right during the video call, she defiantly took pills. Everything seemed to go dark in front of my eyes. I didn't know what to do. Several friends saw it all and immediately asked what happened. We went outside, I told them everything, and they were shocked too. We thought about it for a long time, and I decided to fly to her again.\n\n\n\nWhile waiting for the flight, I tried to call, but to no avail. She lived in a dormitory at the university. I somehow found the contacts of the girls from her dorm and started calling everyone. Only one of them knew her and agreed to check it out. Fortunately, it wasn't that scary\u2014she took the usual vitamins, nothing dangerous. That girl stayed with her until I arrived.\n\n\n\nWe only met the next evening. Nora looked tired and sleepy, and I felt humanly sorry for her. We talked. She said she felt lonely, that I was \"always with someone,\" although that wasn't true.\n\nAfter I flew to Nora because of her \"attempt\" to get poisoned with vitamins, we talked. During the conversation, she suddenly suggested breaking up. I didn't want to\u2014no matter what, I still loved her. But she said she's already dating another guy.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, he was \"better\" than me: wealthy, he had a small shop, an apartment and a car. Let it be old, but its own. I tried to persuade her to think at least a little bit, not to make a decision in a hurry, but she was adamant.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the conversation, she said a phrase that I will remember for the rest of my life.:\n\n\n\n\"If you buy me a new Lexus, I'll stay with you.\"\n\n\n\nIt was a blow. I couldn't afford such an expensive car. By that time, all my savings had been spent on her and on the operation. We broke up.\n\n\n\nI returned home and began to recover from my illness. But things got complicated \u2014 due to the humid climate in the city where Nora studied and the autumn rainy season, my health deteriorated dramatically. The recovery took much longer than I expected. For several months, I practically did not get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThere was no money. I called the landlady of the apartment and explained the situation \u2014 fortunately, she allowed me to postpone the payment for a couple of months. But there were still loans. I collected these loans to send money to Nora, buy her gifts, travel with her, pay for medicines and recovery.\n\n\n\nThe debts grew to such an extent that I found myself in a hole from which I could not get out. Collectors started calling, threatening, calling parents, friends, acquaintances. My family started asking me to \"do something to stop calling them.\" I was afraid to go out, even to take out the trash. It was terrible.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, I was able to go to work. And I was lucky: on the very first day, I was promoted from an ordinary salesman to a warehouse manager. The salary has become stable, and the schedule has become convenient: a week of work, a week of rest. In my spare time, I got a job at a car wash, where I was paid daily. Thanks to this, I was able to close my apartment debts and start paying off my loans.\n\n\n\nBut the banks and collectors wanted me to repay the entire amount at once. All my accounts were seized. I couldn't even buy food for myself. The total amount of debt was about $25,000, and my income was about $1,000 per month plus $250-300 per week at the car wash. Half of the salary was withheld to repay loans.\n\n\n\nDespite this, I felt a little calmer\u2014at least the debt was decreasing.\n\n\n\nA few months later, Nora got in touch again. She said she was bored and wanted to start all over again. She knew that I still loved her. It turned out that her \"new boyfriend\" had just used her and dumped her. Moreover, she gained credits.\n\n\n\nAnd like a fool, I accepted it again. I started paying her debts again, buying gifts, helping her. I have postponed my loans. And he was fucked again.\n\n\n\nAfter a couple of months, she started dating another guy. She left me again. After staying with him for about six months, she came back, apologized... and I accepted her again. But in every argument, she kept accusing me of cheating\u2014the one that never happened. And I put up with it all.\n\nso several times, every time she was abandoned, I took her back. I've never asked any questions about their boyfriends\u2014why they did this to her, what went wrong. I wasn't interested, I just loved her. Because of her and the debts I had accumulated, I couldn't pay for my studies. At that moment, I was in my last year, everyone got their degrees, but I didn't. I sacrificed everything and everyone for her. In the end, I was left alone.\n\n\n\nOnce again, Nora confessed that she loves me and wants everything back, to start over. I accepted her again. You know, every time I took it, I did what she wanted the relationship to do: not to control it, okay, no problem, don't call every day, okay, I'll call you once a week, don't take the time, okay, 101 roses every week. but she quickly got bored with it every time.\n\n\n\nAnd this time she said again that I don't give her as much time as she wants. I don't remember it verbatim, but there was something like - I'm a loser. and at that moment, I just didn't care about her. In that very second, I fell out of love. Something broke inside. I calmly said,\n\n\"There are a lot of girls in the world. If you don't become my wife, someone else will.\"\n\n\n\nShe didn't say anything in response. She probably realized that this time it was serious. I accepted something that I couldn't accept for several years.",

When I was 10, I said to my mom how my feelings toward the world created umbereable emotions but I, wouldn't kill myself yet. Because that too would create \"sadness\".  \nI saw something in her eyes.\nAnd by the time I realized, It feed my anxiety and broke my heart. \n\n  Because I can't control myself, I hurt the people around me. But i love them, i need them. So I would gladly bury everything to be a better friend, brother and son. They are what matters the most after all. \n \n  When I grew up in my teenage years, the accumulation of anxiety and the lack of control over me became quite difficult to handle. Thus, I had trouble find any sleep.\n  So at 15yo i was determined to find a solution, and I searched. Until I found a way to calm down my emotions. A way to stop anxiety and fall asleep. A shortcut to stop everything. \n\nSo how did I \"cheat\"? \n\nSimply by masturbating. A lot. \nEvery night, to feel asleep. Sometimes in the morning so I could be calm. \nAnd the miracle potion worked. \n\nEverything was good. As always, doing a lot of sports every weeks, be good at school and the most important: zen with everyone. Never had my teenage rebellion, always dodging conflicts and kind to the people I loved. \n\n  Interesting side effect; my sexuality was tone  down, so I wouldn't be obsessed with girls in my life. And more generally, connecting with others. \nI fixed my problems ; no emotional explosion, no anxiety, people loved me. I was happy. \n\nYou may have guessed already but for me at this time, I didn't knew what the consequences would be. \n\nMasturbating a lot everyday created addiction and my connection to the world shattered. I became passive, spectating my life instead of leading it.\n\nThe only thing keeping me moving was the sport. So when I stopped, it became a disaster. \nI became someone who run from everything. \nBy running, i didn't took care of the things around me. The things I cherished the most. \n\n  Because the only time I felt alive was when i would take the drug, ie when I masturbate. I lost myself quickly. \n  I lost a lot of friends because of my passiveness. Two of them were above 15 years of friendship. One of them, my best friend with who we wished once to grew old together. \nFailed to be there when they needed me. \n\nFailed my grades too.  Because I couldn't get to work seriously.\nI failed, failed, failed even if I knew what to do, even if I knew the consequences. But my body wouldn't move an inch. \n\n  So when life hit you truly hard, and you know that the only thing that could've prevented it was doing the right thing. Me being passive, swallowed me into hard and long depression. \n\nEverything I did was because I couldn't help to control my emotions, my anxiety, my attachment to the expectations of the others. \nEverything was because I was out of control. \n\n\nAnd all I did to solve this problem was disconnecting the machine. \n\n\n  I keep doing the wrong things, still losing the ones I love, hating me for failing what I do. And taking the drug I created many years ago to be happy when everything hurts me. \n\nI drowned because of a stupid shortcut. \nEntering this cycle of pain where the only path to save myself is to do things my body consider's hurting myself.\nIt needs to stop, so I try. \n\n  As the time passes, the failures in life accumulate. Every one of them having roots in this passive problem. \nFeeding my eagerness to control my life. \nBut every step outside the track accumulate, and my body keep learning one thing : I have control in my despair. \nIt's far more easier to fall than climb up. So I became more than comfortable to my fails, I lean toward them. \n\nNow, I'm a mess. Dealing with addiction, and a liking in me failing. \n\n  It feels like sinking underwater with oxygen bottles. Knowing the only thing that could help me getting out, would be to let go of them. But I can't, when I try, when I fail, I feel they get more and more entangled. And I keep breathing with it, until I touch the end. Until the light faze out. And certainly, until my body dies. \n\nI keep thinking about it. \n\n Keep asking me when will I get up on my feet and successfully walk toward what I truly wants. Or put more simply, when will I be able to truly live? \nMaybe I'm young and dumb, maybe it will resolve soon or later. But I'm struggling for far too long and I think I'm getting tired. \nNow I only hope that I could, at least for a moment, be myself before it's too late.\n\n\n\nTldr: when I was young I trade my control and anxiety problems with addiction and self sabotaging by masturbating everyday. \n\nSide notes : I'm writing on a throwaway account. Sorry for the poor grammar, I'm not native. Sorry for the phrasing, I wrote to feel better and I may writed poorly/weirdly.  \nSo to end on a positive note; I'm glad I wrote it down, it felt surprisingly good.\n",

    "content": "Haven\u2019t been together all that long, about half a year so I know I got out early, but I\u2019m still so upset, this is the most Dr. Phil/Jerry Springer situation I could\u2019ve imagined for myself. I know this is super long, this is just crazy and it\u2019s so hard to process.\n\nI work with this girl in a nursing facility, different departments so we don\u2019t work closely but I see her in passing all day every day I work. I knew there were some warnings from the start\u2026 she had recently gotten out of an engagement, there was a decent age gap, she had some significant trauma including abandonment from her drug-addict parents, physical abuse from her grandparents, molestation from a cousin consistently, an older brother once (13 siblings, all half siblings).\n\nI kept my heart guarded at the start, but she kept giving me signs to feel as if things were going to be different for us. Early on I made it very clear I wanted to be exclusive and she initially had disagreed with me and we separated for a few days. She then came back to tell me she\u2019d changed her mind and really liked me. I once overheard a phone call between her and her ex\u2019s dad in which the dad asked her if she would come see the guy off to rehab. My ex tells the dad that she could come as a friend but \u201cthat\u2019s not what he wants and I can\u2019t let this jeopardize my relationship anymore.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been pressing her, this wasn\u2019t some planned performative call, it was real.\n\nThings are starting to feel serious, and not necessarily too good to be true sort of way. She clearly had never had someone who was effective in communication or building a healthy relationship. She said things or made decisions that seemed unsafe or misguided, ie. she thought it was going to be acceptable to move in w her molester cousin once he got out of jail in a couple months, a sentiment she expressed very early in the relationship but I squashed immediately and had a long hard talk with her about that experience and how unacceptable it would be for her to ever be in that position.  We had heartfelt conversations that were so hard, like pulling teeth from her but so rewarding at the end, it felt like growth and building something special.\n\nThe ex is on contact from the start. First it was to get her money back from him over time, then it was bc he was best friends w her little sister\u2019s bf and he was around, then it was when he was going off to rehab. I realize now she created a situation where if he called and I wasn\u2019t there she got to talk to him, and if I was there, she\u2019d show me the phone and we\u2019d both go \u201cdamn, that dumb idiot just isn\u2019t getting the point.\u201d I hate it and it\u2019s not like I have no suspicions, but I think \u201chere\u2019s the girl who was molested, abandoned, abused, the girl who thinks it\u2019s in any way okay to live w her molester. Maybe if I continue to show unconditional love like she\u2019s never had and show her someone has her back, maybe she\u2019ll start to make healthier decisions for herself.\u201d\n\nThis last weekend my buddy comes to town to visit. Great friend, and when I had originally told him about my relationship he was not shy about being skeptical. We\u2019re all hanging out and she gets a call from her ex and shows us. My buddy acts like he doesn\u2019t know the situation and asks her all about why he\u2019s still in contact. He tells her a story I had been there for but had forgotten of when he had dated a girl for 9 months only to find out her \u201cex\u201d thought he was the gay best friend. He says one detail in particular that strikes a chord, \u201cI\u2019d think she\u2019s here 5/7 nights a week, we\u2019re together all the time, how could she find the time?\u201d She says \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like that, I\u2019m gonna block him rn\u201d and we watch as she puts them in \u201cthe graveyard\u201d (she changes the contact name to \ud83e\udea6\ud83e\udea6\ud83e\udea6 and blocks them but doesn\u2019t delete the contact) but doesn\u2019t actually block him. I don\u2019t really register it at the time bc we\u2019re drunk.\n\nI forget the suspicion for a while and we\u2019re drunk and having a blast (she just put him in the graveyard so it\u2019s all good right?! Dumbass) so a little later when I\u2019m in my feels and taking care of her when she\u2019s drunk, I say \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna remember this, but If you do pretend you don\u2019t so I can tell you sober. I want you to know I love you.\u201d She reciprocates all drunk and I put her to bed.\n\nBut that detail keeps scratching my brain. I\u2019d told people w excitement that she\u2019d spent 13/16 nights in a row at my place and that we were pretty close to moving in together. I remembered she didn\u2019t actually block him. I go and look at the phone. I see that communication literally never stopped, she instigates just as much. There\u2019s talk for sex appointments, I love you, I miss you more than you could know, etc. I see he knows everything about me. He says \u201cwanna hang?\u201d \u201cSorry, I\u2019m hanging out w his little cousins right now, maybe later\u201d they just plan everything around me. She\u2019s is kind of a sex freak, I\u2019m having sex like 3x/day and coughing up dust at that rate. She talks with him about being annoyed he won\u2019t entertain her public sex kink.\n\nI call the bf. I\u2019m proud to say I very calmly told him \u201chey man, I know you know about me. I promise I\u2019m not coming to beat your ass, I have no relationship with you and whatever lying that\u2019s been done is on her, but I really need to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d He denies all besides a vacation she took that we were exclusive during. I finally say something mean and hang up. She gets texted again about how crazy it is someone older that her is so upset over her and that maybe she should tell the truth to me. I say \u201cor you should\u2019ve like a man\u201d and he says \u201cyou just caught yourself some crazy and now you pay the price like a man, just like me\u201d and calls me pathetic. (Not to sound condescending but I\u2019m a doctor and he\u2019s a drug addict)\n\nI spend the rest do the night/morning packing all of her shit into her car while she sleeps away on my bed and pass out at 6am. She wakes me up an hour later and asks me to come to bed and we have our talk. She denies everything except for the vacation since I already knew and \u201cI was drunk.\u201d I tell her I\u2019m not stupid and that I see the proof and she insists tooth and nail that nothing physical actually happened and does not acknowledge her behavior would be cheating off conversation alone. Totally denies me and has an attitude w me when I kick her out. I spend the next couple days a mess.\n\nI finally decide that I wanna talk to someone at work, A) bc we\u2019re getting worried she\u2019s gonna create drama or a false story and B) I\u2019m gonna be going through hell and I want to be able to make eye contact w someone and have them know I\u2019m going through it. This girl already knows what I wanna talk about. She tells me about a time during her engagement when she was driving another engaged coworker home. The guys fianc\u00e9 and mom are making a nice dinner upstairs and wonder where the guy is. They look on the security camera to see the two of them having sex in the car.\n\nThere was a new cook at our facility that started working like a month into our relationship. He seems nice enough, 40, single father of 4. My ex told me that he had been makin advances and she kept telling him no. Me and my ex hadn\u2019t been public yet so I didn\u2019t say anything and she went to HR to submit a harassment claim. The guy stopped talking to her altogether but stayed employed. I now found out that when he got called in to talk about it, the only reason he wasn\u2019t fired is because he had proof that she drove over to hook up and that they went on a date (also while we\u2019re exclusive). I finally decide to talk to a big boss at work and my direct boss to make my story heard in case she tries to tear me down with lies just like the single father of 4. (Mind you she\u2019s 21 and he\u2019s 40-something). The big boss tells me he\u2019s gonna talk to HR first thing in the morning to make my story known for me for insurance.\n\nI ask the HR lady two days in a row if she\u2019s heard from big boss and she keeps saying that she hasn\u2019t so I tell her my story. She tells me she sees the pattern and just like several other coworkers who I\u2019ve confided in, express \u201cI wanted to warn you but you seemed so happy.\u201d She also tells me an interesting detail that she\u2019s actually in-laws with the cook she screwed that was accused and is well aware of his good character.\n\nThat night I go to talk in person w I first confided in from work who texted me the information about the other 2 coworkers she slept with. She now gives me some history that the big boss had a made creepy advances to her before along with other coworkers what has caused them to leave the facility (or at least 1 person). I also hear he\u2019s fond of my ex. And I connect the dots that when the cook was accused, due to the HR lady being his sister in-law, conflict of interest would\u2019ve prevented her from settling the matter\u2026. It would\u2019ve gone to big boss. And this whole time I\u2019ve wondered how do you make such a grossly horrible accusation and get proved wrong and NOT get fired. And I\u2019m starting to get the sense that she will sleep w anything that will give her attention (she is absolutely drop dead gorgeous and curvy in all the right places, so looooooots of men), so I serious wonder if she screwed big boss too to keep her job.\n\nIn the midst of finding out all of this I finally get contacted by her, letting me know she\u2019s dropped my stuff off. There\u2019s a letter from her that acknowledges she destroyed the relationship and she wants to \u201ctake responsibility for her actions,\u201d but she takes accountability for no 1 thing in particular. Mind you she doesn\u2019t know the new information I know, but she says \u201cI\u2019m sorry it looked and felt like I cheated.\u201d She calls herself unforgivable knowing I have a huge heart and love her. She acknowledges that it\u2019s over but the next day says she\u2019s given me time and space but needs to know where we stand. I tell her I\u2019m writing a letter but I need time to gather my thoughts. This girl is clearly delusional about her choices and their meaning, or she truly is remorseless. I later decide that I\u2019ll keep my 13 page letter to myself.\n\nI have talked to more people about this at work than I wanted to, but I\u2019m so fucked in the head right now, I feel like I\u2019m having an impossible time not. I just got told from another coworker that before I worked there she was found to be sitting on a residents lap (they all have cognitive decline issues or smell like pee).\n\nI\u2019m just absolutely disgusted with her behavior. I\u2019m truly at the point where I look at all my coworkers and wonder who all she\u2019s slept w before and who during our relationship. The more I talk to people the more everyone knew she should\u2019ve had a warning label. I also know that someone might hear in the near future and think \u201cshe\u2019s that sexy and that easy of a lay? yes!!\u201d One time very early in the relationship she expressed offhand she lost a friendship because she slept w the girls dad one night.\n\nI\u2019m disgusted with my own ignorance and bliss. I truly haven\u2019t felt so passionate for someone in 5 years or so. We were talking about moving into our own place (I just got out of school, I\u2019ve been working on debt and living at my parents for half a year), she told me I was the first guy to ever make her want to have kids. We frequently spoke of a life together. I think back to a camping trip I went on w her and her grandparents and uncle (later find out the father of the cousin who molested her for years). We\u2019re on the trip already and on a stop on the drive and the family is talking about her ex, how much money he owes my girl, basically how much of a loser he is. Grandma goes \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still w-\u201c I see her eyes flick towards me and she says \u201cwhy you still talk to him.\u201d I felt a feeling of dread so strongly creep over me. I confronted my girl and idk what she said but she convinced me otherwise, I think my brain knew I was trapped on the trip anyways and took the easy route.\n\nI was about to meet her close siblings for the first time (2 sisters) and see her other family for a Halloween thing in a couple weeks and I was so excited to meet them. She\u2019d kind of kept them from me, for 1 her younger sister was dating my girl\u2019s ex\u2019s best friend, so regardless of how shitty their relationship was, they wanted their double date back and didn\u2019t like me without meeting me. I was excited to meet them and win them over and now I realize I was gonna be the only person in the whole group who didn\u2019t know I was getting played, the laughing stock, the elephant in the room.\n\nI\u2019ve never felt so devastated in my life. I really do understand that it was a short relationship and that it could\u2019ve been a lot worse and so many of your stories are, but I\u2019m so ready to start a family and I really thought we were building something special. And although she is broken as shit and clearly not someone I can give another shot, I think in her own twisted way she did really care about me and that to her love and sex are not in the same category. I understand now that this is Jenny from Forest Gump, the girl from the butterfly effect, the girl that\u2019s damaged and doesn\u2019t want to work to get fixed and healed. I know I could\u2019ve seen through the rose colored glasses to see the continued relationship with her \u201cex\u201d coming, but I never could\u2019ve seen the scope of this. She is so damn sexy she could pick up any guy at the grocery store, screw them in her car, and never see them again, and at this point I\u2019m feeling she\u2019s entirely likely to have made that decision at least one in her life.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been much time at all, but I\u2019m scared this is going to be incredibly hard to move on from. I walk around work mad knowing that nobody had my back. I see her 4/7 days a week and have to wonder what story she\u2019s telling, and I still wonder from if her messed up perspective she thinks that I\u2019ve abandoned her like her parents did before. I see her in the hall whether she sees me or not and she looks like she\u2019s hurting as well. My buddy asked my if I\u2019ll get a new job, but this one pays me $10,000-20,000 more a year than all the others I got offered and I don\u2019t want to let her ruin that for me, especially since up the this point I\u2019ve enjoyed my day to day tremendously. I just want her to disappear and I can\u2019t believe she can cause events with so many coworkers and still somehow be here.\n\nI\u2019m pissed I fell in love so quickly and head over heels.  I\u2019m worried I\u2019m gonna pack away an insecurity from this relationship and let it harm a future one. I\u2019m planning on looking into therapy this week, I had been thinking about going for a while for a tune up, but now feel as if I seriously need it. I\u2019ve never been so thoroughly used and abused and I just can\u2019t believe how crazy and absurd her behavior is. I miss her like crazy and I\u2019m pissed that I miss her like crazy. In any other scenario I\u2019d read my letter and I really want to now, but I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s capable of being remorseful or accountable and I don\u2019t want to be told the truth is invalid and ALSO I\u2019m so terrified to let her know what I know now that she\u2019ll create havoc and what\u2019s best for me is that the drama ends ASAP. I still worry that the games have not ended yet, that she\u2019ll try her hardest to entice other coworkers attention in my presence.\n\nThanks for reading, sorry it was so long. Felt good just to type it all out.",
