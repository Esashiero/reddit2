            <div class="content">
Hi,

A few years ago, I (M/21) met a guy (M/21) while I was starting my apprenticeship, and I quickly became friends with him. My best friend advised me not to befriend him because he had a bad feeling about him. At first, I didn’t care and didn’t notice anything bad about him. He introduced me to a lot of new things, and through him, I discovered some hobbies.

As time went on, I started noticing that he was constantly crossing my boundaries and embarrassing me in front of others. I stood up to him, but it didn’t help much, and since he did the same to others, I thought it was just normal behavior for him. I also noticed how bad his interactions were, especially with women. He whistled at women on the street, made comments about the breasts of one of my best friends, and generally spoke very negatively and objectifyingly about women.

As I became more aware of these negative behaviors, I tried several times to confront him about these issues, but he was never willing to admit fault or change his behavior. So I slowly started to distance myself from him to protect myself. During this time, others also began distancing themselves from him.

I talked to some people and then found out that he had stolen fire extinguishers from public buildings multiple times just to spray them for fun. I also found out that he had been involved in several fights and had even beaten up one of his friends.

Then I started dating a girl, and I often vented my frustrations about him to her. He used to tell a story about getting a blowjob behind a festival tent, always saying that it didn’t feel right and was kind of weird. When I complained about him to this girl again, she said that she knew him too—and then she told exactly the same story, but from her perspective:

She said that he forced her to drink a lot of alcohol, and when she was drunk and could barely stand, he took her behind the tent, pulled out his penis, and forced it into her mouth. She got very scared and immediately ran away.

Considering the way he always told this story, everything suddenly made sense—it all fit together, and I believed her. I still believe her. It was rape.

I was very shocked by this story and kept it to myself at first. But after about a week, I couldn’t stay silent any longer because, from that point on, he wasn’t just a danger to me but to others as well. So I told a friend about it. She wasn’t surprised—she had already expected something like this from him. She started spreading the story, and more and more people found out about it, leading to him losing even more people.

When I met up with another friend who was also friends with him, I initially had no intention of telling him about it—but he spent the whole day talking about him. So I told him what had happened. He confronted the guy with the accusations, but according to him, the guy denied everything. Later, another friend confronted him as well, but instead of responding seriously, he tried to change the subject and made jokes.

As the end of our apprenticeship approached, I thought I would never have to see him again. At that point, he didn’t know that the accusations had become so widely known because of me. After the apprenticeship ended, things were quiet for a while.

I paint legal graffiti in a designated graffiti area in the next village. I’ve been painting there for years. He also paints graffiti, but rarely, if ever, in that area. Suddenly, he started painting over my pieces again and again. I saw this as a provocation and painted over his pieces in return. This went back and forth for a while until he finally sent me threats like “Last warning, buddy!” and “Not so cocky, little man.”

I then tried to call him because I wanted to resolve the issue. He didn’t answer, so I sent him a voice message saying that I wanted to clear things up. He ignored me and instead drove to the wall and painted a huge penis over my artwork. After that, I blocked him and accepted that he wouldn’t listen to reason.

Then things were quiet again for a while. I occasionally saw him in clubs but kept my distance, and he never noticed me.

Recently, however, he released his first rap EP, and one of the five songs is a diss track against me. In it, he completely insults me, mentioning my illness, my father, and other sensitive topics. He didn’t make a single accusation or insinuation in the song—he just insulted me to show that he is strong and I am weak. He wants to intimidate me.

Since I am physically weaker than him and I know that he is willing to use violence, I am also afraid of him.

Last Sunday, I was invited to a big graffiti party where many sprayers gathered to paint together against far-right politics. He was also invited, and the organizer initially wanted to place me at a wall next to him. I explained that, for personal reasons, that wouldn’t work, so I was given a different wall.

I didn’t want to miss the chance to meet many other sprayers and make connections in the scene, so despite my fear of him, I went—and I took three of my best friends with me to feel safe. That worked well.

But when two of them went to the bathroom for a moment, he suddenly came up to me, pushed me, shouted at me, and told me to “set things right.” I stayed defensive, started shouting for him to leave me alone, and walked away. More and more people noticed what was happening and intervened because he started following me and threatening to hit me. When he realized that everyone was standing behind me, he ran away.

That’s when I realized how much he hates me and how much he wants me to be intimidated by him. He just wants to silence me to prevent further damage to his reputation.

I have been trying to ignore him since the issue with the penis on my painting, but he keeps provoking me, and I’m afraid that he might seriously harm me—whether by coming to my house or by catching me alone somewhere.

I need help—what can I do?!

            <div class="content">Small warning for SA/R@pe
I’ve never used Reddit before so I’m not sure if I have to sensor certain words but I will just for the sake of having people hear my story and this not get taken down. Hi I f15 have an ex boyfriend who we’ll call AD, I was with AD for 8 months and we ended it in February not long after Valentine’s Day this year. He was 15 at the time of our relationship he’s 16 now, I’m not going to start at the beginning because everything was fine and normal basically we were in the honeymoon phase of our relationship. The reason I’m asking now is because he’s entered into my life again because he’s got in touch with my new boyfriend. So me and AD were fine until at least a month before Halloween then things started to change with me and AD after that, he started ignoring when I said no to doing sexual things with him which I didn’t mind in the beginning because he was my boyfriend but it was when he started being rough with me and not caring about who he was doing sexual things in front of. He even attempted to f!nger me in the back of a crowded bus while my friend also f15(we’ll call H) and some guy he knew from college was there sitting beside us. I’m not going to act innocent and say I didn’t also make out with him on a bus or sit on his lap but I never made it sexual like that, I think it’s when he wouldn’t take no at my friends Halloween party for an answer which is when I started getting fully creeped out because at first it was just AD doing disgusting things towards me but at this “party” if you can even call it that. He was pushing himself up against me gr!nd!ng into me and whispering stuff into my ear mind you he’s willingly and soberly doing this in front of my little sister (f10 who we’ll call L) and H who did hear me say something like “no AD fuck off not right now I’m not comfortable” so we then left the room to go to the bathroom and asked AD to stay with L and to give me some space. I know I shouldn’t of trusted him to be in the room with my little sister but at the time I didn’t realise how bad the assault was so please don’t get on at me for that, anyway he said that was fine so we used the bathroom and I was about to put a new tampon in but someone tried to come in and after realising it was locked they knocked and H said “fuck off (her brothers name, We’ll call him Jay)” but AD said it was him and not Jay so H unlocked the door and he came in, we asked where L was and he said Jay was in the garage with her but that wasn’t true cause my jay was in the living room with her dad and his pal. Then we left the bathroom to go sit in H and her little sisters room(who wasn’t at the dads that night) but he blocked the door with the bed then we sat down and started talking about genshin(a video game) then he got really touchy feely with me and got up, turned off the lights he then pushed me down on the bed and started kissing me and my neck while H was like wtf and made a face cause she didn’t know what was going on I told him to stop and don’t do that and she wondered why he had to turn off the lights to do that. (H is on the high spectrum of autism so she didn’t understand what was going on in the beginning) at some point during the kissing he pulled his d!ck out and said “I want H to see” while turning on the lights he also asked “do you think my d!ck looks big?” And she just sat on her bed not expecting that so she froze up cause what else do you do in that situation but after that she heard me telling AD no multiple times to get off of me, trying to push him off me and at some point he pulled my pants down and then he r@pes me for the first time that night while H is sat there wondering what the fuck is going on. (I don’t blame her for not knowing what to do in that situation, she’s been through something like that before and we were a bit drunk I just feel bad for putting her in that situation, anyway he goes for a while f!nishing in me before her dad comes up tries to come in but can’t cause AD blocked the door and asked “what the fuck we were playing at” cause AD shut the door on L and Jay was in the house so my sister was all alone in the dark minus coloured lights and he got off of me and told me to “hurry up and get dressed” then moved the things from the door and her dad and his pal could come in. Her dad then said “Right you fuckers what are yous playing at leaving ur wee sister locked in the garage” we all went out to the garage and we had to get her to use scissors to open the door from the inside cause the handle got stolen, once she opened it we comforted her and we didn’t really bring up the fact AD had left her there and lied to us cause he said Jay was there with her but that wasn’t true and the second time was when we all went up to the bathroom Jay wasn’t there he was downstairs so that I could finally put a tampon back in but AD told me and H to come back into the room and was trying to make me give him a blowjob he was pushing my head into that area which is when I bit his d!ck after that he got up and decided just to fuck me but he couldn’t finish so he went at it for a while then gave up got ready then left before us then me and H both sat while she held me for a bit while we cried. I got pregnant because of that experience(?). I got out of school, bought a pregnancy test with AD and H cause I almost passed out in school and I had been feeling sick in the mornings this happened near the end of November so I had been pregnant for about a month, I then talked to AD, H and I even went to L about it and then we got jumped like a week after we found out and that’s when I had to tell adults like the police and my gran and that’s when I was getting help to make the right decision on if I should keep it or not and AD was really the only person who full heartedly wanted me to keep the baby, I do have some messages to prove this obviously for a little bit I did also want to keep it but I couldn’t because I wouldn’t be able to look after it. But after I got rid of it that’s when AD just turned into an absolute asshole like didn’t even ask just did whatever he pleased and a lot of the time it was in front of H most likely because she froze up the first time she seen it and this was done repeatedly throughout the rest of our relationship. He was particularly rough when autumn wasn’t there he would usually push and hold me down then he would continuously fuck me until he couldn’t then finger me until he was done leaving me feeling sore and disgusted. One time when H wasn’t there me and AD were at my grans she wasn’t in her and L were most likely at my Nana’s I went into my grans room to look for a lighter and AD came up and we kissed a little then we were about to leave and he pushed me down onto my grans bed kissing me more forcefully and wouldn’t listen to me telling him no because ur not supposed to have sex after an abortion he then tried to force himself in me and because I had my legs tightly shut he was trying to pry them open and then he pushed himself into me and because he was so forceful he tore his dick. After that I tried ending it with AD multiple times but it never turned into anything we had a break for a bit and then we just went back to normal until the end of the relationship. Should I take him to court? Thanks for reading.</div>

            <div class="content">Basically to not make it too long, my brother in law convinced my cousins friend to suck my dick. He was pretty slimey about it but I asked the girl if she wanted to do this and I was too scared to look like a bitch in front of my brother in law (who is 5 years older) and I sort of just went with it. She started giving me a blowjob, she started crying midway through bc she realized she was cheating, but 5 min later she jumps into bed with me and then later ended up fingering, licking, blowjob, dirty talk and she kept wanting to mess around until I came on her. She wanted me to cum on her and I can’t believe I blew a load with ny cousin probably less than 5 feet away. 

Everybody was drunk in this situation, we had just gone clubbing and were at a hotel, and this girl has been feely with me on the other night went out. I feel bad for even having sex with the girl who maybe felt pressured by my brother in law, I feel bad about me getting my dick sucked while my brother law was right there. While everybody was asleep I basically came on my cousins friend in the same room as them which is pretty disgusting. I’m somewhat of a soft spoken chill guy regularly, but drunk I’m the life of the party and sort of just go with the flow. I wish it wouldn’t have happened and I feel terrible about it. 

I’m wondering if I should text my cousin to ask if she cares whether I fucked her friend, and I just feel so regretful. This is the first time I’ve made this stupid of decision like that.

I don’t know how to feel and I feel bad and empty about what happened, but at the same time so confused bc this sounds like a crazy thing and like it’s so wild that it doesn’t sound like me.</div>

            <div class="content">I’ll preface this by saying that everyone in this story is in their mid-20’s.

So this weekend, I (M) went to my friend’s (M) bachelor party. We’ll call him Fiance 1. He and I and a few other of his friends and family got really, really drunk on the first night and I blacked out. (Someone made me a couple of mixed drinks that were probably waaay too strong.) Anyways, I don’t remember going to bed, but I know that we discussed sleeping arrangements before we were drunk and I was supposed to be sharing a bed with one of my other friends who was there (not with Fiance 1). Anyways I woke up up at maybe 2:00AM in the bed to Fiance 1 giving me oral sex, kissing me, and trying to put my hand on his penis. I just pretended to be asleep the whole time and eventually he stopped for a while, but then after like 15 minutes passed he started again, at which point I pretended to wake up (I had already been awake the whole time) and Fiance 1 stopped. I went out to the living room and waited for like and hour until I thought he was asleep, and then I snuck back into the room and grabbed my things and left in the middle of the night.

This same weekend, my wife (F) was at Fiance 2’s (M) bachelor party (same couple), so I drove a few hours to get to them and I told them what happened. Everyone was upset obviously, Fiance 2 apologized for what happened to me and he speculated that maybe Fiance 1 didn’t realize it was me because Fiance 1 was really drunk and the two of them often wake up to having sex in the middle of the night with each other and not knowing who started it. (Don’t blame Fiance 2, he was just trying to make sense of it as much as I was. I had already emphasized to him that I was fine personally and he had emphasized to me that it still wasn’t acceptable.) Fiance 2 called Fiance 1 to confront him, and Fiance 1 was in tears and felt so bad and said that he didn’t remember any of what happened. Fiance 1 told Fiance 2 that he wanted to talk to me if I wanted to, but I said that I wanted to wait a while first (Because I was/am conflicted: On a personal level I don’t feel super violated and I am circumstantially willing to forgive him, but at the same time I know that what he did was wrong, and maybe I shouldn’t forgive him because maybe he has done/would do the same thing again to someone else.) Anyways, I spent the rest of the weekend with Bachelor Party 2 and we enjoyed the weekend together for the most part. We only stressed a little bit about the situation.

Here’s some other info: 
- Fiance 1 and 2 JUST bought a house together. Like, a month ago.
- Their wedding is in a few weeks, and I am a groomsman. 
- Fiance 2 is obviously very conflicted, but given the house and wedding situation, I can guess that he’s probably going to continue with the wedding as normal. 
- I already know I’m not responsible for what happened :) I really am fine personally, I just don’t know how to respond. Am I allowed to forgive him or do I have a responsibility to report him?
- My wife and two of our other close friends have already told me that they don’t want to go to the wedding. Maybe they would still go if I was really, really insistent, but it looks like everyone else is already starting to make a decision regardless of me.

Is there *any* circumstance in which Fiance 1 can be forgiven? Should I cut off this friendship? Should I encourage Fiance 2 to leave Fiance 1? Should I report Fiance 1?</div>

            <div class="content">Throwaway for obvious reasons, protection of my privacy, and my friends&#x27;.  


So, what has happened is exactly as the title suggests. The 3 people involved here, let&#x27;s call them Josh, Mike and Tim, for the sake of this story and their privacy.  


What happened was a couple of nights ago, it was Josh&#x27;s birthday, so he decided to have a house party this year, keep it lowkey, have just a few close people over, and pretty much get blitzed out. Fast forward a few hours, I decided to make a move and go back to mine, since I had an early morning the following day. Things started to die down around 2am, as they usually do. Out of the 14 people invited, only 4 decided to stay the night at Josh&#x27;s. Now, bare in mind all the girls had left at this point as well, so the only 4 people that stayed back were all male.  
People who stayed back besides Josh were Mike and Tim, and another friend (not involved in this incident).  
Now Josh has a 2 bedroom apartment with 1 queen size bed in his room and 2 single beds in the other, for when his brothers decide to visit him.  The 4 guys that stayed over pretty much passed out/decided to go to sleep at 3am.  
Anyways, so this is important to what happened, Josh passed out on the bed in his room, and Mike and Tim fell asleep on the single beds in the other room, while the other friend took the couch in the living room.  


Pretty normal scenario, after a house party, right? Wrong.  


Josh called me and a couple of other friends last night, and asked if we could meet for about an hour, since he had something to talk to us about. At this time I had no idea what he was talking about, but Josh is someone that has been in and out of legal troubles when we were younger, nothing too serious though, so we thought he might have got himself in trouble again.   
Before meeting the guys, I was with my girlfriend (she is Josh&#x27;s cousin) who told me, he had been extremely jittery and nervous all day, I&#x27;ve never known him to be that, so I couldn&#x27;t possibly imagine what he wanted to talk to us about.   


When 2 other friends and I met with Josh later I&#x27;m the evening, what we heard, pretty much shattered our minds.  
Josh said that, when he passed out, he felt someone creep into his bed at around 4am. Josh in his half passed out, half &quot;I could give a fuck&quot; stage got it into his head that it was his ex girlfriend that got in his bed (she was at the party as well, they&#x27;re still friends). Now a few seconds later, Josh felt a hand go down his pants and grabbed onto his dick and started jerking him off. Now bare in mind, Josh was drunk enough to still believe this was his ex girlfriend...for some reason. That happened for a couple of minutes, before he said he felt his shorts being pulled down to his thighs and felt a mouth on his dick, sucking him for about 30 seconds, when he felt a hand grope his ass, that is when he flinched and felt the mouth pull away from his dick, his shorts being pulled up to where they were, followed by the person walking out of the room.  
When Josh turned around to see who it was, it was... Mike.  


Mike, someone that I&#x27;ve known for 20 years,  
Mike.   
Mike who has been one of my closest friends since we were 4, that Mike.  
Mike, who has there for me during the worst time of my life, and me for his, that Mike.   
Mike, who knows things about me that my girlfriend or parents don&#x27;t, that Mike.   
This dude is a brother to me... or at least was?   


Anyway,   


After Josh told us this, we didn&#x27;t know how to fucking react, the fact that he got molested and that it was fucking Mike that did it! By this time, we had Tim join us, Tim is a very soft spoken, timid kinda guy, but he is someone that would take a bullet for you, if you&#x27;re his friend.   


This is when he spoke up, Tim said &quot;You guys are fucked up after hearing this happen now... This has happened with me 3 fucking times! And yes, it was that piece of shit Mike!&quot;   


Me... No words (how the fuck do you react when you hear this about your oldest friend?)   


Tim proceeded to tell us all the 3 incidents (won&#x27;t go into detail, since it will be a super long read, but just know the fact that, every one of those 3 times Tim was extremely drunk and the 1st 2 times, Mike was absolutely sober)   


The 1st time this happened with Tim was 2 years ago. The 1st question on all our minds were &quot;Why the fuck did you not say anything at the time?&quot; but I understand where he&#x27;s coming from, Tim said he was ashamed and embarrassed this happened to him, and the fact that he didn&#x27;t wanna soil Mike&#x27;s name amongst friends.  


I mean, imagine meeting a guy that molested you, for 2 years, seeing him every weekend with the guys, seeing him at every party, seeing him every time we hung out, and not wanting to cave his skull in for what he did, that takes a special kinda person, that&#x27;s Tim.   


Moving on, what Mike did is out in the open now, amongst us friends only, of course. Josh and Tim called him, and confronted him (in very colorful words lol). After minutes of denying it, he finally admitted and apologized for all 4 incidents (1 with Josh and the 3 with Tim).   


We haven&#x27;t actually met Mike in person after all of this came out, but will on the weekend, since he lives towards the outskirts of the city, and it&#x27;s not viable to drive all the way there on a school night.   


As much as I know Mike, he&#x27;s never in a 100 years going to admit to being gay, since he is extremely homophobic. Does sucking someone&#x27;s dick, make you gay, if you&#x27;re homophobic ? I don&#x27;t mean to mock or poke fun at anybody with this post, but this is literally the 1st time we&#x27;ve all faced something like this. So, if anybody could suggest how to get through probably one of the most weirdest conversations I&#x27;ve ever had, I would really appreciate it.   


TLDR : Extremely homophobic and my closest friend molested 2 male friends when they were drunk/passed out. Need advice on how to talk to him about it.</div>

            <div class="content">I&#x27;ve always been a loyal girlfriend prior to this event. My girl-friends organised a weekend in Chicago, seen as my other half was spending his bachelor party in Vegas. The weekend started off very nicely, we had a spa-hotel which we treated ourselves to nice massages, facials and so on. At night we would go out and enjoy ourselves as girls do. There was around 15 of us no family except from a cousin. Never did I know the girls had chipped in to hire out a room in a good nightclub. We received all  the VIP treatments, the night was going well and of course the girls booked a stripper or in this case strippers. I really didn&#x27;t mind.

There was three strippers and I have to admit they were pretty hot from first sight. I was of course getting all the attention which concluded with the strippers inappropriately touching me and waving their things around in my face. A few of the girls got a little handsy with them which on egged them on. One of the strippers saw me as a target or something and was smothering my the entire night. He decided to wave his penis around in my face and resting it on my chest and my lap. He took my hand and placed it on his penis. Suddenly the girls woo&#x27;ed and I felt it was right to touch it. I was a little drunk and peer-pressured but I continued to handle it. Things got carried away, he then repeated to me &quot;Kiss it&quot;, so I did, which furthered with him putting it in my mouth. It felt harmless so I did give him a blow job.

In the morning there was a silence in my presence and the girls were acting strange. My cousin came up to me and asked whether I sucked the stripper off which I quietly replied to, saying &quot;Yes&quot;. She gasped and told me I was getting married. I told her I thought it was what you&#x27;re suppose to do. From that moment all I feel is guilt, but my question is should I tell my husband? I&#x27;m sure it will get out but just encase it never did, should I or shouldn&#x27;t I?</div>

            <div class="content">okay so me(male,18) and my friends were at a club drinking and we all got pretty wasted. one my friends(f)(18) was in love with me but didn’t ask me out because i’m doing long distance. 
after the club when i took her home she went to her room i was going back to my place. she came out of her room and just kissed me i pushed her and went back down and texted my girlfriend that im going to sleep because idk what just happened to me, i’m still very drunk here.
she came to my room and kept on knocking 
i put a pillow over my ears but she started calling my name and i got irritated and i opened the door and took her to the stairs and kind of shouted at her and then she started saying that she’ll tell my girlfriend that we kissed and then she started saying that my girlfriend will believe her rather than me and i believed her. i was drunk i’m sorry.
she then said that she wants more i said no and started saying no that’s when my friend came and i give him the eyes and they helped me to go back to my room but this time i didn’t lock the door and when i was sleeping she climbed up to my bed and layed next to me while i was sleeping and my dick was out when i woke up and she had it in her mouth and i was scared asf and couldn’t move. i wasn’t drunk here but i just couldn’t move and didn’t know what was happening and she climbed on top of me and put it in, kind of. i just closed me eyes and tried to think that im dreaming and after a minute or two of it happening i finally got the courage to move and sleep face down, i was too wasted and slept immediately. i don’t know when she left or if she did anything after that. we haven’t talked since. it’s been a few months since this has happened and my girlfriend doesn’t know this.
the reason for that is that i think i cheated on her but my mind tells me that i didnt. i’m scared to tell her.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/16ovhoj/was_i_raped/" target="_blank" class="title">Was I raped?</a>
            <div class="content">

This guy, who I’ll call Josh (19), was my fiancé’s best friend from highschool. They’d been very close for 8 years and I’d known him for 4 years. He was always what we’d call “simpy”, completely obsessed with girls who were usually totally out of his league. Much of which I’d now class as stalking. He was this very large, overweight, gross, unhygienic troll who was somehow still popular around town because of his extroverted, or what I’d call narcissistic, personality.  

I’d been told by other girls that he had a history of sexual assault, not rape, but forcing girls down and making them kiss him. I also overheard him saying awful stuff about girls he’d “slept with” at parties and how they’re all sluts. Eventually he talked his way into me dropping my guard. Getting me to believe he “saved” all these girls from being raped and that the accusers are liars.

This guy ended up talking his way into our lives completely. He wanted to live with us one day and wanted me to basically raise his kids on some commune. I hoped deep down he was joking. He tried to date my little sister and form some friendship with my mother. He wanted us around his parents an uncomfortable amount. He declared himself the godfather of our daughter and best man for the upcoming wedding. Both my fiancé and I are massive pushovers, introverted, too empathetic, we really let him run a muck in our lives.

Anyway, so my fiancé, Josh, and I all got invited to the same birthday party of this girl we knew. It was supposed to be our night off while my mum took care of our baby. Josh was super adamant on staying over at our house afterwards when he could’ve just taken his own Uber home. 

By the end of the night I was completely trashed drunk. I couldn’t walk straight and I was acting very silly. 

Once we got back, Josh pressured my fiancé into drinking more with him. Suddenly my fiancé was out cold very fast and Josh dragged him out of the room, he looked dead. I would’ve been a lot more concerned if I weren’t that drunk. Everyone was drunk but Josh.

Josh then made two tall glasses of gin mixes with a bottle he had actually stolen from the girl’s house whose party it was. I told him I didn’t want to drink anymore and that I was very tired. He just kept pressuring me and came to sit really uncomfortably close to me. Eventually I caved to having one shots worth.

So I started sipping the drink and recoiled immediately. As I was telling him how it tasted awful he started chanting over my voice “skull it.” When I told him no, he wouldn’t stop, so I just did it so he would shut up and stop acting so manic. He was scaring me a bit. Then he started laughing at me saying that he filled it half way with gin. So that was around 15 shots in a glass. 


My memory is very bad of the following events. I couldn’t see straight, I was confused, and talking incoherently. I started crying about something about my past and he just started touching me. Then he grabbed me and started making out with and I just sat there not moving. Then I told him “I don’t want to do that.” He stopped and started agreeing that it was bad and rambling about how much he loves my fiancé.

He then told me I looked as if I was going to vomit and that I need to go outside. So I tried to walk outside but couldn’t really walk on my own very well. So he played the white knight taking care of me. He said I needed a drink to sober up and then brought me another glass with alcohol in it. He had to keep reminding me to “drink up”. Eventually I did. 


He started talking about how he’s basically in love with me because he can’t have me and how I’m a tease and all this strange stuff. I told him that I just wanted to be friends and that it wasn’t okay what he did before. 

But then he managed to get me to say that I was also in love with him because I said I loved him as a friend. None of it makes any sense looking back. So I just started sobbing into this glass on poison. I was crying because of him and then he’d act like the saviour to comfort me.

Soon the other drink kicked in. I was very disorientated. Eventually I found myself making out with him on his lap and laughing hysterically at nothing. I think I fell on him or was pulled onto his lap after trying to get up and walk away.

Then I went crazy. Rolling around and thinking everything was hilarious. Being all huggy and kissy. I have barely any memory. 

He told me to get on the ground. So I did. I didn’t expect his penis to be in my mouth. He basically just had sex with my head and somewhere during that I was just gone. Everything went black. I woke up on the grass.


I wanted this to be over now. So I tried making a run for it down the back of my property saying I need to go somewhere. I fell over very quickly or was pushed. Suddenly he was on top of me and I was in the mud. 

I tried to communicate that I didn’t want any sex but in a way that wouldn’t set him off. I now saw him as dangerous and I was very isolated. He just kept kissing me. He told me that “he’d make me feel good” at which point he put his fingers in me which I said hurt a lot. He then started biting my vagina. I started trying squeeze him off me with my legs. 

I was making a lot of noise by crying. So he said “ssshhh” and kept repeating that “you’re okay.” He then asked me if I was “okay” and I said “yes” while sobbing. So clearly not yes. I was just repeating him. Nothing of what I was saying was coherent. I said I wanted to go inside because I was cold. He talked me out of that.

Basically, the whole situation was him making unethical advances on his best friends fiancée and when I’d reject him he’d just get me to drink more and manipulate me some more before trying again, until I was mentally not there anymore.


He got me to “agree” to sex in the end after I said I didn’t want to or tried several times to find an out. In my head I just wanted it over. Before he continued, he told me very seriously “I’m not raping you. No one needs to know about this. It’s our secret.” I went from crying to very manic like “yay, no I’m not like those girls who talk”, followed by hysterical laughter. Then the crying came back. 

When he tried to penetrate me I made it very difficult for him until he gave up. I began gaining consciousness of my situation a bit. Then he got mad. Told me to suck him off. I tried reluctantly but started vomiting a bit. So then it was just a hand job which I don’t think I had the ability to finish so he did.

Then I threw up inside for a very long time. Afterwards I just acted like nothing happened while on the inside I was dying. I literally gave him a kiss goodnight before going to sleep. I didn’t what else to do, it was so awkward and scary still.

The next morning I cried hysterically for hours and several months later I’m still not over it.</div>

            <div class="content">By successfully I mean, was it worth it? Did anything actually come out of it? Did they go to jail?

This is honestly pathetic at this point. I was in a fucked up FWB relationship for like a year. He had sex with me while I was literally passed out multiple times, resulting in an abortion. He also flat out raped me while I was sober a few months after I broke it off. I have not had any contact with him since then and I&#x27;ve also cut down heavily on my drinking. 

Well, this passed weekend I got incredibly messed up at a party for the first time in months. I was gone. I do not remember most of the night. I do not remember the incident, even after hearing what happened. 

I remember locking myself in my truck because I didn&#x27;t want to sleep at the party (I&#x27;m paranoid about being too drunk around people I don&#x27;t trust now) and leaving my keys with a good friend of mine. She was going to come get me when mostly everyone left. This sounds dumb now but it made sense to drunk us. 

Apparently the ex FWB showed up at some point as we have many mutual friends and I haven&#x27;t told any of them about what&#x27;s happened in the past. I was already passed out in my truck. He got my keys, came into my truck and had sex with me during which I peed all over myself and him (I was also so drunk I peed myself the last time this happened, I acknowledge my drinking problem). I don&#x27;t remember the actual sex but after I was made aware of it the next day (he texted me saying he couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about the other night and how much he missed my pussy) I did remember him shoving his dick in my mouth and keeping my head there until I gagged and couldn&#x27;t breath. My throat did hurt the next day. He also didn&#x27;t use a condom, I&#x27;d bet money he came inside of me and I&#x27;m not on birth control. I took plan b. 

I&#x27;ve never wanted to go to the cops before but this is fucking ridiculous. I have texts proving that he had sex with me that night but he ignored the question &quot;and you didn&#x27;t realize I wasn&#x27;t even fucking aware of your presence?&quot; He tried calling me and I ignored it. That was the last contact I had with him. 

Has anyone experienced something similar and went through with reporting it?</div>

            <div class="content">I&#x27;m currently incredibly depressed as my mental illness works and don&#x27;t have the energy to post every single detail but I can&#x27;t help but be confused trying to label what happened to me.

I got incredibly drunk the other night at a friend&#x27;s birthday party. Throughout her party an old hookup kept trying to text me asking me to come fuck him. He called me 5 times I think in the span of half an hour, I didn&#x27;t pick up. He kept texting me too but I didn&#x27;t want to answer. 

I went home thinking I was home free and got high with my roommates and all of a sudden he calls me again, as if he knew I was in the prime position to be influenced. I pick up the phone, I say heck with it and tell him to come over. The high has yet to hit btw. He&#x27;s over within 10 minutes, we start to fuck and at some point it&#x27;s no longer enjoyable so I tell him I&#x27;m tired and don&#x27;t want to fuck. He kept asking me to do things I didn&#x27;t want to do - things related to anal, sex without a condom, holding me down during a blowjob. At this point I can still tell him to fuck off, I&#x27;m lucid enough. Soon as I rolled over from being tired my eyes closed and the high hit. I was bedlocked, borderline snoring and conscious enough to hear and feel what was going on but I couldn&#x27;t move and I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes. 

Next thing I know he&#x27;s asking me if I&#x27;m awake, I can&#x27;t answer I keep hoping he&#x27;s gonna go away and I kept telling myself to pretend to be asleep. And then he tries to fuck me without a condom. He&#x27;s drunk and can&#x27;t get it up, he&#x27;s touching me in places I didn&#x27;t want him too like my clit, sucking on my breast, trying to penetrate me with his fingers when he couldn&#x27;t with his condomless dick and then when he got tired of not being able to fuck he rolls over off of me and says, &quot;it&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re tired we don&#x27;t have to do this&quot; &amp; then proceeds to say &quot;come on just blow me.&quot; I&#x27;ve been unresponsive for the past 10 minutes idk why he thought I&#x27;d suddenly be like oh mmm okay!

Eventually I really had to pee and while I wasn&#x27;t against peeing on him so he could fuck off, I didn&#x27;t want my mattress to get dirty and I managed to move my head to get up. I felt heavy and lethargic nd I fell off my bed trying to move. Idk how long I was in the bathroom for but when I got out I ran into my roommate and asked for his help kicking someone out just in case and kicked him out.

This guy only messages me when he wants sex, he kept trying to call me baby and kissed my forehead like our relationship was anything more than sex. Next morning he doesn&#x27;t text to check up on me. I blocked him, stripped my bed of my sheets bc they smelled like him and have been dissociative. 

I have a boyfriend we are in a LDR &amp; are currently open. I told him, &quot;i had an encounter that was borderline assault&quot; but never elaborated. I&#x27;m scared he&#x27;s gonna hate me for bringing this on to myself. 

Help me please. </div>

            <div class="content">Three Fridays ago I went to a friend&#x27;s party who I had only seen once in six years. Guy having party we will call &quot;D&quot;. Another guy who went was my best friend from ages 12 to almost 19, and we will call him &quot;M&quot;. M was a great friend who supported me when I was going through self-harm, an abusive ex who was blaming his suicide attempts on me, and many sexual assaults. He was angry a lot though and we started drifting once he tried to force me to have sex with him. So I stopped hanging out with him because the risks outweighed the fun I had hanging out with him.

&amp;nbsp;

So when D contacted me a month and a half ago to go out for M&#x27;s birthday I decided to go, wanting to see my old friends who I really reallllyyyy missed. We had been at a bar and old friends, including M, hugged me for so long that I cried when I got home that night out of regret for ending these friendships.

&amp;nbsp;

When I got invited out on June 4th to D&#x27;s place I was excited and happily obliged, bringing a friend. At the party I climbed onto the roof with M&#x27;s help and we had an amazing night laughing and reminising. This would be a good time to mention that M has a gf who he has been with for almost 4 years. Sitting on the roof he started grabbing my ass (and I found out a week ago that he grabbed my friend&#x27;s ass too) but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. Later on one of the underwires in my bra was stabbing me so knowing I was around friends I took it off. When I went back outside for a smoke M noticed instantly and began grabbing my breasts. This is when I knew something was wrong. I told him to stop and asked about his gf who he said &quot;Fuck her. She doesn&#x27;t suck my dick&quot;. He then asked me to go for a walk with him, which I agreed to because I thought he would respect me. I had said 30 times that night when he was helping me get on the roof how much I trusted him, and telling my friend to trust him. The walk led to the bottom of a ramp and he grabbed my drink and told me to suck his dick. I said no, that I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with it, and to fuck off. He wouldn&#x27;t let me go so I ended up pretty much just licking it because he stopped trying to force me when he thought I was doing it. After at least half an hour of him not letting me leave my friend came and found us. I was relieved and practically ran back to D&#x27;s.

&amp;nbsp;

I briefly told her that I was being forced by M and thanked her for coming to find me. Shortly after though she had to leave so I walked her to her cab. M came with and because I was drunk I didn&#x27;t realize once she got in the cab that we would be alone again. I blacked out for a minute or two because the next thing I remember is standing on a church porch (it&#x27;s right beside D&#x27;s) and him telling me to have sex while grabbing my arms lovingly saying my name over and over while he looked into my eyes. I said no and tried to walk away but he pulled my pants down and turned me away from him. I pulled them back up and turned to face him. He pulled them down again and turned me back around. I blacked out again. I remember sitting on the porch smoking with him saying how I&#x27;ve only had sex with one guy in 5 years and that &quot;I was practically a virgin&quot;. Then I remember yelling at him to get in his fucking cab, he must&#x27;ve called one and I think he was kissing me or pulling my shirt up for the tenth time after I said no. He went home and texted me that he regretted not cumming in my mouth. I went inside and told D who made me pasta and let me fall asleep in his bed watching Rat Race.
The next morning D had a letter in his mailbox (he wouldn&#x27;t open it with me there but he told me what it said later) saying that a rape had occurred on the church&#x27;s property and that they have it all on camera. D is probably getting evicted because of this. He also got to watch the video because they wanted him to ID us.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple days later M messages me saying he doesn&#x27;t remember anything and that what he does remember was consensual sex. He has blacked out drinking before. I told him everything and he seemed ashamed but confused. He says he loves his gf and would never do that to either of us. He eventually told his gf who made him get an STI test and he told me he would keep my updated on that if I kept him updated on whether I was pregnant. A week passed and he messaged me that he was clean. I kept talking to him for 2 weeks in total because I needed someone to talk to and I think to not feel like a victim. He took sick days off work while I couldn&#x27;t. He has apologized many times, even telling me I need to report him and that he deserves to be punished. He seemed torn apart the last time we talked.

&amp;nbsp;

My &quot;period&quot; the past 2 weeks (yup 2) has been not like a real period and has stopped in between. Flow, colour, and cramping have all been irregular. Talked in more detail about this with a friend who has miscarried and we believe it was one. I have been excessively smoking and drinking so it wouldn&#x27;t be unheard of. I have been so fucked up the past 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t know how to feel or what to do.

&amp;nbsp;

I just needed to vent and hear what people have to say about what happened to me. I may have missed details with everything I wrote but I&#x27;ll add an edit if I realize I forgot important information.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Knew I&#x27;d forget something. D claims he works for a rape hotline but he made things worse. He wouldn&#x27;t let me know what the letter said or even acknowledge that I has a right to know as an involved party. The morning after I woke up to him playing with my nipples (remember, he already knew what had happened) and he told me at least 5 times to go shower (which as he should&#x27;ve known washed off evidence, making a rape kit less effective if I wanted one).</div>

            <div class="content">For years I was so ashamed of the way in which I lost my virginity. I was staying over at a friends house after a night out clubbing, we came home absolutely wasted but I thought I was in a safe place.

My friends brother, sober, heard us returning home. He waited until my friend was in bed and I was settling down on the couch for the night. He&#x27;d made several advances to me before, all politely rejected as I wasn&#x27;t attracted to him and found him creepy.

Well he saw an opportunity that night, so drunk I could barely walk, he sat down and kissed me, undressed me, put his penis in my mouth and then penetrated me. I didn&#x27;t say no. I was drunk beyond recognition or caring. I didn&#x27;t know the condom fell off.

In his mind, I consented. He sent me off for a condom, I opened my mouth when he put his penis towards my face. In my mind he took advantage and had to approach a woman shit faced drunk who wouldn&#x27;t say no. Sober, I&#x27;d have said no. Tipsy, I&#x27;d have said no. 6 hours of hard liquor? I didn&#x27;t say no. 

He knew exactly what he was doing and he got what he wanted. And it was my own fault for being so drunk. My best friends brother did that to me, and I cant allow myself to think it was rape because if i hadn&#x27;t been so drunk, I would have stopped him.


I don&#x27;t drink anymore, at all, as a result.</div>

            <div class="content">I’m in college and one time I was at a party and this guy used to be friends with was there too. While I was drinking but wasn’t very drunk yet he asked me if I wanted to come over to his room and watch a movie and I agreed to. When we left the party I was drunk and started feeling sick in the Uber and even fell asleep for a bit. As soon as we got out of the car I threw up into the nearest trash can. He then walked me over to our building. I was so drunk I didn’t even realize my purse was on me and so I thought I had forgotten it along with my id. He reminded me my room number and what to tell the security guard to let me into the building since I thought I didn’t have my id. I can’t remember much of the rest but I ended up in his room and remember him trying to have sex with me but can’t remember how my clothes got off or how we ended up on the bed. He proceeded to aggressively try having sex with me but wasn’t able to penetrate because I was a virgin and it was too tight. He continued to keep trying kept making me get into different positions to try to have sex with me. I vaguely remember saying no when he wanted me to go into doggy style. I also have a vague memory of him having me give him a blowjob but me giving up after a couple minutes because i couldn’t feel like I could sit up any longer. I remember him finally leaving me alone once I started throwing up on the pillow. He asked me if I was throwing up and took me to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. Then I finally was able to sleep alone on the bed and he slept on his empty roommates bed. In the morning I felt super shitty and hungover and just quickly put my clothes back on and proceeded to leave the room. He complained about me throwing up on the pillow and I just said sorry and left.</div>

            <div class="content">this happened on the beach....idk if it’s a gray area situation or what

I’ve already posted this but I accidentally deleted the wrong account. 
I’m just looking for advice and different perspectives on this, to help me process it.


So a few weeks ago I came home for the weekend, and I was planning on going out with some friends. They ended up canceling last minute. This guy I hung out with once saw my location was on, and he reached out, asking if I wanted to go to the beach.
 
I agreed to go because I drove all the way to that area, got dressed up, and had nothing else to do. He told me to drive to a parking lot, park, and that he&#x27;ll pick me up from there. I parked my car, and then I got into his car. We drove 5 minutes and parked in front of his house. We talked and caught up because it had been a year since I&#x27;ve seen him.
I asked if he wanted to go to a party or a club (I wanted to go somewhere public with people). He said sure, but we realized the clubs would be closed soon as it was already close to 2am. As I texted someone to see if the party was still happening, he went inside to grab alcohol and blankets just in case we went to the beach instead.
The party got canceled, and he said we should just go to the beach, and I said sure.
He came back with a green water bottle filled with whiskey and a little bit of soda. In his car, we started drinking, and he kept bringing up how he wanted to hook up in the past, but we never did. He asked me if I&#x27;d want to hook up with him tonight, and I said something about how I would if I wasn&#x27;t going to school in Miami, and I also said I liked someone else at my college.
I also said that I think because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt his feelings. I just really didn’t feel like doing anything like that tonight I didn’t even want to go out that much. I could tell he was annoyed by that. But he kept complimenting me and massaging my shoulders, and just like being flirty. I didn&#x27;t really know what to say because I did not want to create conflict, but the whole time I had the person I liked in Miami on my mind.
I had a few sips of the whiskey he brought, but I finished the two white claws I had brought with me. After chatting and drinking, we eventually walked out to the beach, picked a spot near the access point, we set up blankets on the sand. We got under the blankets because it was so cold. I really just wanted to sit under the stars, drink, and catch up; I wasn&#x27;t in the mood to do anything else because I really did not even feel like going out that night, plus I really liked someone else. Almost immediately after we got out there, he started touching me. He like rolled on top of me and was reaching under my clothes and took my bra off. I didn&#x27;t really know what to do because I didn&#x27;t want to upset him, but I kept reminding him that there&#x27;s someone else in the picture and that I don&#x27;t want to do this right now. He started fingering me and trying to make out with me, but I kept turning my head so he couldn&#x27;t kiss me, and I was trying to push him away and telling him that I shouldn&#x27;t do this. He kept saying that it doesn&#x27;t matter and that he won&#x27;t tell the person I like.
I kept telling him that I shouldn&#x27;t do this right now, I want to respect the other person I like, and that we should stop. He was like un-doing his pants, and I didn&#x27;t really know what to say because he wasn&#x27;t listening to me. In my head, I thought I&#x27;d just go along with it until it got too far because I&#x27;m bad at saying no to people at times, and I didn&#x27;t want to cause a problem. I felt drunk walking to beach and at this point I could still feel drunk but I felt myself sobering up because I was confused about what was going on. I told him that some things he was doing felt good, but we shouldn&#x27;t take it further, but he kept wanting to have sex, and I told him I didn&#x27;t want to. He didn&#x27;t seem to take that into account. Maybe because I was saying it in a lighthearted flirty way? He put a condom on, and in my head, I was like, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to do, I don&#x27;t want to do this right now.&quot; 
He kept reaching under my skirt and trying to put his penis in but I kept trying to push him away, and twisting and turning to keep him from having sex with me.  He was kissing my neck really hard, and he just wouldn&#x27;t get off.  He kept using more force, which surprised me. I said, &quot;okay, we&#x27;re not having sex right now,&quot; and I was saying it nicely; I was being overly friendly or playful because I didn&#x27;t know how to handle the situation, and I&#x27;m never really aggressive with people. At one point I guess he was frustrated because I kept moving, and he was holding my arms above my head to get me to stop. The whole time his penis was right near my vagina but I am not 100% sure if he actually put his penis in because I was trying hard to move and push it away. I think he did a tiny bit because I asked him, &quot;did you just put it in?&quot; and he didn&#x27;t really answer me.
 
But at one point, the condom fell off because I kept trying to like move him away. That got me worried because if this was going to happen then, that would make it worse. He managed to overpower me more by gripping and holding down my arms tighter, and I said: &quot;you don&#x27;t even have a condom on we can&#x27;t do this&quot; just to get him to stop or distract him. I also kept saying, &quot;why don&#x27;t we just finish drinking and just chill and talk&quot; to distract him. I was surprised because he had gotten so aggressive by like gripping my arms tighter or just trying to get me to stop moving. He just kept saying, &quot;we are doing this&quot; and &quot;why not, what&#x27;s the big deal.&quot; After a while of wrestling and pushing him away and trying to talk him out of it, I told him I really had to go to the bathroom, thinking it would get him off. After a lot of arguing, we both stood up and went to the bathroom.
 
Once we both stood up and I thought that we were getting up to leave, I sanded off one blanket, and I saw that my phone was buried in the sand, and he was like “dang” cause there was so much sand in my phone. I told him I had to get up early the next day to go back to Miami for school. I was so confused about what happened, and I was saying things to distract him again because I just wanted to leave.
 
We started getting our stuff. He handed me one blanket and wrapped it around my shoulders. Then out of nowhere, he  like tackled me into the sand, and he was on top of me again. I was on my stomach now, and the blanket was still around me, and sand got in my eyes. He was trying to put his penis in again I think, and it seemed so easy for him to do because I was wearing a skirt. This was when I got pretty scared, and for a moment I thought maybe I should just let it happen. But I started saying it louder for him to get off I was like, &quot;get the f*** off of me, wtf stop.&quot; I kept trying to squeeze my legs tighter, and I managed to turn around, and he was still on top of me, but I was facing him, and I was like &quot;we&#x27;re not doing this you&#x27;re a cute guy, but I&#x27;m not doing this okay&quot;. I said that to not make him mad, and I did use to like him a year ago. Somehow I negotiated with him and to get him to get off.
 
When he was still on top, he was saying things like if I don&#x27;t have sex with him, I have to give him a blowjob as if I owe him that or something. He also said that he&#x27;d give me $50 or $100 to have sex with him. And I said &quot;I don&#x27;t want your money this is insane&quot; I also said &quot;stop you just want to sex with someone tonight&quot; and he said &quot;no I want to with you&quot; but I told him that&#x27;s not happening and I told him you can go get any girl you want this doesn&#x27;t have to happen right now.
 
I asked him when we were walking back to his car &quot;did you know this was going to happen&quot; and he said no, then I asked, &quot;then why did you think I wanted to do that or that was okay&quot; and he just said that he didn&#x27;t know.
 
I feel like I said things so I wouldn&#x27;t make him mad or hurt his I also brought up how I hooked up with his friend a while ago to maybe weird him out or distract him and get him off, or I said it because I was mad.
 
But he did say if I hooked up with his friend, then why shouldn&#x27;t I hook up with him too. He just seemed really desperate to do all this; he said earlier he hadn&#x27;t had sex in a long time. When he was gripping me tighter, I kept saying to him that this isn&#x27;t okay and asking &quot;what are you doing,&quot; &quot;is this for real right now,&quot; &quot;we aren&#x27;t doing this okay,&quot; and he kept saying &quot;I hear ya&quot; but would not stop.
Or he would say &quot;okay fine&quot; and stop for a second then I&#x27;d loosen up then he&#x27;d go back to trying to have sex again. We left the beach finally, and he had to drive me back to my car. I even apologized to him because I felt bad or felt like I did something wrong cause he was annoyed or disappointed.
 
We got to the parking lot where my car was parked. I was about to leave, and while I was saying bye,  I asked him if he was okay to drive cause we were drinking. He then reached over and kissed my neck really hard, and he reached under my skirt and said, &quot;just have to feel what I&#x27;ll be missing&quot; or something. I just didn’t know what to do or say.
I looked in the mirror on the way home, and there were so many hickeys on my neck; he said he hoped he left some to make the guy I liked jealous. I texted him about it a few days later saying that he really scared me and he said he was sorry and that that he was drunk. But he sent me a nude pic a few hours after that. I am not sure what to think exactly because it could be considered a gray-area situation because I agreed to hang out with him</div>

            <div class="content">I am sorry for how long this post is. I am a male university student, and I am going to give some background information for context before the situation I am asking about. I am bi, which is relevant, and I want to warn you that I will be describing potentially upsetting situations in this post. 

In high school I was assaulted by a girlfriend who had a habit of being a predator towards me and at least three other people. In my case it was fairly minor, groping and kissing after I physically tried to get away from her, not rape or anything, though I was later told that she was planning on doing more had I not dumped her when I did, and I know her other partners experienced worse because they stayed longer. 

Fast forward to now, I am in university, and I am dealing with a bad time in life. I have been doing things that are bad for me because I am really struggling with my episodes and getting treated is hard. I had a bad childhood, and while people seem to like me, I  feel chronically out of place and I think I go out and build these massive social networks in an effort to feel less alone. In February I was at a party. I drank a lot and I think I was probably on weed too. I don’t remember a lot of the night. I started talking to this guy, I thought he was drunk/crossed like I was, and at some point we started kissing. He asked if I wanted to leave and I said sure, so we did. I don’t remember much of the walk to his place but I remember some guys yelled at us about being gay. Then I remember we were in the lobby. Then his room. The next thing I remember is that I was on his couch, laying next to him, saying some bullshit about a show I was watching. At some point i remember him pulling his dick out and my pants down. I have a really fuzzy memory of him putting his dick in my mouth, but at some point he took it out. Then I remember he seemed upset with me, and he started asking me if he could fuck me. I said no because I hate being bottom and he kept asking for a while I think (not sure actually how long, these memories are really foggy). At some point after that I was laying on the couch doing basically nothing, I think he was laying there jerking off, at some point he took my hand and put it on his dick, and then after an unclear amount of time he asked if he could cum on my face. I think that sounds gross and i remember thinking ew, but i said yes because i wanted him to stop asking me to let him fuck me. He did, and then immediately seemed displeased again, saying it seemed like i didn’t like that. (Why would i???) At this point it had been a while since my last drink and my memory starts to get a bit clearer. He cleaned himself up and gave me some way to clean my face, and then his demeanor changed really suddenly. He started talking to himself about how drunk I was and telling himself he was a good person. After a bit of that he insisted I needed to go home, I struggled to put my shoes on which pissed him off, and i didn’t understand why he was so upset. When he got me outside the building he asked if i knew my way home and I pointed in the direction of my apartment, but he said i didn’t and claimed he needed to go with me. I just wanted to go to bed so i let him walk with me instead of arguing. On the walk he kept telling himself he was a good person and asking me to “play the quiet game” (I was yapping about god knows what), and then when we got to my building he said goodbye and left. I tried texting him asking what was going on and why he was being so weird, but he just never responded and that made me mad so I never tried to ask again. 

For a few months I thought that this was just a weird story about a guy acting strange, but the other night I was talking to a friend and I mentioned the story and he pressed for details and I felt strange. I realized it sounded bad to keep saying “i can’t remember”. Then I said that J (the guy from the party) acted like he had just committed a crime. And then I started feeling really strange. I have been thinking about it. I was laying around barely awake most of the time I was with him. And I thought, “would I have done what he did?” And the answer was very much no. I cannot imagine having sex with someone who is in the state I was, especially if I was as sober as I now realize he probably was. I am just so confused. I don’t know if he was just being a little creepy or if I let it happen again. I’m really upset with myself at the thought that I put myself in the position that it even could have happened again, I told myself after I broke up with my gf that I wouldn’t let anyone ever do that again. But I feel like I might have. I hope I am just being dramatic, but I am mad at myself for getting so drunk and for going to a party by myself when I know it’s dangerous. 

What do you guys think? I don’t know. I feel like I was being stupid but I feel like I am being crazy for even thinking this might be an assault. I certainly couldn’t do anything about it even if it was so I don’t know why I even care. I’m just so tired of people who just see me as a way to get romantic or sexual gratification. I feel like nobody ever wants to be my partner, they want to own me or get me drunk/high and pretend I own them.  </div>

            <div class="content">

Hey, I don&#x27;t really know if what happened to me was sexual abuse or not?
Friday night I went partying with some friends. One of them was someone who, in the past, I hooked up with, but it was an one time thing.
I didn&#x27;t really thought about it because he was a really good friend of mine and has a girlfriend anyway. The night went well, but I ended up drinking too much and have blurry memories. By the end of the night, I was kinda wasted and I don&#x27;t know how it happened, I think he told me he was horny or something like that and I laughed it off, but ended up in his apartment before anyone else arrived. (All the friend group was going to sleep there, I was going to sleep in the couch)
I don&#x27;t know why he thought I liked the idea of having sex with him that night, because I don&#x27;t remember to agree, but he moved us away from the group and guided me to his apartment. I remember telling him several times to reunite with them and to wait for them before going to sleep, but he didn&#x27;t wanted to.
In his apartment he took me to his room and laid me on his bed, I remember telling him to stop by that time as he was trying to undress me and I was trying to dress me again. Told him several times to stop, let him know that I was very drunk, in fact I couldn&#x27;t even move when I was laid down, but he still continued. I still told him to stop, asked him to do it another time when I wasn&#x27;t drunk but he didn&#x27;t listen and here is when my memories starts to collapse, I only have shorts and not reliable recollections of what happened next.
I just remember fragments and don&#x27;t know how much time are one from another, the next thing I remember is him putting his penis on my mouth but I couldn&#x27;t even move. Then he started touching me and I don&#x27;t remember what happened next. I have memories of him telling me to shut up, I don&#x27;t know if it was because I was telling him to stop, but then I remember that after that, I asked him to have sex? I remember don&#x27;t wanting to do anything at the beginning, but after he touched me withouth my consent, I think then I asked him to keep going, I don&#x27;t know why because I know I didn&#x27;t wanted to. I don&#x27;t remember if we actually had sex, just remember him telling me to suck his dick, me denying, he touching me and telling me: &quot;see? you did wanted it&quot;
The worst part is that I don&#x27;t know if I really wanted it?
I woke up and cried, because I didn&#x27;t really wanted what happened but hated myself for doing what he told me after he touched me.
Is it sexual abuse?
Sorry for my bad english.
Also, I didn&#x27;t flirted with him that night, in fact we barely talked with each other.</div>

            <div class="content">I&#x27;m sorry if this comes out weird, I just feel really dazed and none of my thoughts are coming through properly. I went out with my flatmates last night because one of them had their 20th birthday. We were in Soho in a night club. I had drunk a bit before coming out but I only had about three drinks in the club.

At the end of the night somehow all my friends had disappeared. My flatmate says I told her I wanted to stay which sounds like something I would do (soho is maybe half an hour by bus from the flat) but I only remember being really confused as to where everyone was.

I left with a group of freshers who were heading to the same bus stop as me (I&#x27;m 19). I was heading home and then I don&#x27;t know, this guy turned up. 

I don&#x27;t remember where I met him and as a rule, for this exact fucking reason I don&#x27;t talk to random men when I&#x27;m alone and I&#x27;ve been drinking. I don&#x27;t know where he came from but he was just there and for some reason I was talking to him. I don&#x27;t know how he got my guard down but he did and I&#x27;ve just remembered he gave me something to drink, it was like straight vodka or something but not in a vodka bottle, I don&#x27;t remember what it was in.

Then I don&#x27;t know, we were going back to his place and he kept touching me the whole way, kept pulling my breasts out of my top in the street. He stood over me when I went for a fucking piss, he said he had some kind of kink for it but I think as well he didn&#x27;t want me to run off. I stood up and he had his dick out against me but I told him to put it away.

And then I don&#x27;t know, we were in his house and he was taking my clothes off and I don&#x27;t remember much. I remember him saying that he liked how skinny and small I am. I think I remember trying to stop him going into me. I remember that he hurt my breasts, and whatever he did to my vagina hurt. He called me an English whore or something, and I remember trying to strangle him.

And then there&#x27;s another gap and I was putting my clothes on and he was trying to persuade me to stay.

Then I was outside finding my way home and I was really confused but I realised that I was crying and I felt really unclean, and I started to remember what happened and I was hyperventilating the whole way home.

When I woke up this morning I felt really really dazed. Not like hangover dazed (for one thing I don&#x27;t get hangovers 98% of the time and the last time I felt like this I had been spiked) but like full on hit-by-a-bus feeling. I could barely move, and I couldn&#x27;t form a coherent thought and for some reason my upper back muscles are so stiff they&#x27;re rock solid. I can barely hold anything because my hands are so jittery. 

I don&#x27;t get it. I know how to handle myself when I&#x27;m drunk and I&#x27;ve never just randomly gone off with a stranger for exactly this reason. Even if it were something I would do, I&#x27;m barely even attracted to men (as in beside one man I have no interest in men at all), he wasn&#x27;t my type, and he was a massive prick. He kept talking about how disgusting other girls are to try and compliment me and all the other misogynist shit, and I&#x27;m not the kind of person to ignore that just to be nice. He was 29 as well, which just feels creepy. I&#x27;m confused about how I could have agreed to go back to his house given my own protocols and how much of a prick he was.

I&#x27;m with my flatmate who knows what happened. I feel ok for a bit and then I hear his voice in my head saying fake-flirty shit. 

EDIT: I knew reddit was full of misogynists, but wow, the anger anger and suspicion directed at me... I&#x27;m in minus numbers for comment karma on a fucking throwaway.

EDIT/UPDATE: went to A&amp;E and they contacted the police. Police came and interviewed me and took samples, and I&#x27;m going to a specialist exam today.

This is just making it further hit home how ridiculous those claims that loads of women fake rape accusations. I know there are some who do but jesus christ do you know how fucking difficult it is? Going to A&amp;E, having to explain to the nurse, waiting around for hours for the police to show up. Last night I was sat in hospital from 10pm to 5am giving urine samples and mouth samples. I had to give my account four times and repeat over and over what he did to me in minute detail and today they want even more. They want me to go driving around the area to see if I recognise anything, go for a forensic examination of my body, have more in-depth questions asked of me, and even then I still have to give them the clothes I was wearing and answer even more questions at a later date. I have been so tied up in that that I haven&#x27;t had time to eat in 24 hours. I haven&#x27;t slept more than an hour at a time because they keep ringing me up asking if I remember anything new about the man&#x27;s identity or where I was. I feel sick, my anxiety is sky high because I have serious difficulty talking to strangers and I&#x27;m battling feelings of serious guilt. If you weren&#x27;t dead serious, how could you get this far?</div>

            <div class="content">Don&#x27;t want to give out too many details and I&#x27;m using a throwaway because I think the rapist knows my real reddit account. 

So we were at a halloween party and my girlfriend and I were both super drunk when it started. We had invited our other friend along because he was in a really rough spot in his life and he was a close friend and thought he could use a little pick me up. The party was great, everyone had a good time and all that. I ended up passing out on the couch before both of them so past that point is all word of mouth. 

They eventually go to bed and they end up sleeping together, I wouldn&#x27;t think it was a problem because we were really good friends and he was like a brother to us. In the morning she comes to me and wakes me up and tells me that our friend tried to have sex with her. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of it, I thought maybe he just had morning wood or something and was rubbing against her in his sleep. But she gets serious and tells me he was attempting to put his penis in but couldn&#x27;t because she was so dry. I was still a bit hungover and groggy and a bit in shock because I don&#x27;t completely remember what happened but we ended up leaving the apartment and going to the hospital. She gets a kit done and all that, we do everything we&#x27;re supposed to do after an incident like that. 

Now I don&#x27;t know what to do, I&#x27;ve told her I still love her, that she&#x27;s not broken or damaged, she&#x27;s still my everything and nothing will ever change between us and that I&#x27;ll be there if she needs anything. Her mom is here too, so she&#x27;s been a big help making sure she&#x27;s not alone and making sure she&#x27;s fed and comfortable and safe. And she wants to go back to her hometown for a bit to be with family and I don&#x27;t know if I should go or not. A part of me wants to let her go and just get away from it all for a while but a part of me just doesn&#x27;t want her to be alone where I can&#x27;t be there if she needs anything even though I know she&#x27;ll be taken care of.

**TL;DR Girlfriend got raped by a close mutual friend, we got all the medical and initial steps out of the way. But where do we go from here?**</div>

            <div class="content">firstly my friends have all told me this was SA but im not sure

after a house party, everyone was pretty drunk so lots of us stayed the night. i was drunk and high and i stayed in a room with like 6 people and ended up sleeping next to a boy (important note- he had ketamine weed and alcohol so he was also fairly ‘out of it’ but at the time he seemed to have sobered up quite a bit)

after a bit of time just lying there he began to touch me, while i was almost asleep and drunk. he slowly started to touch me more and more sexually and was grabbing my ass. i was aware of this all going on but i pretended to kind of be asleep and let it happen. a few times i like woke up a bit and touched his hand while he was doing it but i never really engaged. i never said no (or yes). he put my hand on his penis which i pulled away from after a couple seconds. after that i pretended to be asleep and when he would like grab my hand i would be all floppy and unresponsive so he would kind of stop, but he kept going and fingered me upwards of like 10 times, thrusted into me through his clothes and gave me hickeys all over my chest. He even just tried to normally kiss me but i didnt move my mouth so he would think i was asleep but he kept going and stopped after a long time of me just not moving. 

idk if this was SA cause i dont believe he’s a bad person and this is a guy who i had feelings for and still sort of do. I just need advice</div>

            <div class="content">TW: sexual assault 







I have had this friend for years and at first, he was really goofy and seemingly had no boundaries. After a few people talked to him about it, he admitted he was bi-polar and began seeking help.

He changed a little bit and slowly became one of my favorite people.

In the last two years, he lost a lot of weight and got girl-crazy. It was fine but I noticed some of the comments he would make were pretty gross.

Since this year, though, he has been really flakey and outright sexist. He complains constantly about women not “following through” and says it’s “bullshit” when women he met on tinder wanted to be just friends. He was hooking up so frequently he ended up with mononucleosis. He would blow plans off for hook ups and begin getting with younger and younger girls (he’s 27 and some of the girls were 19/20.) 

Recently, he got his medical card and I got the feeling he was self medicating for his bi-polar with marijuana. I wanted to ask him about it- and did even ask if he was okay- but he would joke it off.

Overall he hasn’t had much regard for those around him and wasn’t a good person, however, our friend group is very overlapped and even though everyone was talking about his erratic behavior, no one was doing anything about it. I didn’t want to rock the boat, so I kept my mouth shut. I stopped texting him and initiating contact, and that felt like enough.

However, a few weeks ago a mutual friend hosted a party that I didn’t go to (hello, coronavirus anyone?) and I found out he had been locked alone in a room with a crying, blacked out girl. He flashed his penis to her and asked her if she wanted to suck it. (This is all hearsay, but still). The host of the party had to break into the bathroom to separate the two, and this guy admitted “I did something wrong.”

I’m sick to my stomach over this. I myself have been assaulted (by an ex) when I was too drunk and emotional to consent. This friend knows this. From the rumor mill I’ve heard that the two of them have “talked it out” but I’m not sure I want to associate with someone like that.

So I’ve made the choice to be done with him. I don’t want to risk harm to my female friends (or myself) if we’re drinking together. He seems to have no remorse for his actions, considering that he’s still posting on social media like nothing happened.

Overall I’m just angry. A lot of people agree with me that the situation is gross but they don’t want to cause drama. I’m embarrassed and saddened and I just needed to vent.

Thanks for reading.</div>

            <div class="content">Trigger warning in case you didn&#x27;t see the word rape in the title. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
  
This is from years ago, but certain recent events have made me want to share. I was a couple of weeks into my undergraduate degree and went to a house party hosted by the friend of an ex boyfriend. Ex who we will call &quot;Herbert&quot; for this.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Herbert wanted to talk to me about the past and some rumours he&#x27;d heard. I&#x27;m not a bitter person so I was happy to sit in a room with him. He was pouring me this drink which was a kind of clear spirit, but it was really smooth. I asked about the alcohol content and he said it&#x27;s really low, can&#x27;t you taste it, and it was very smooth so I agreed.
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Time went on and he kept asking if we were cool. I was like of course dude, we broke up as teenagers no hard feelings. Eventually he started asking if I remembered his dick, I can&#x27;t remember the exact wording. I laughed it off, I said that&#x27;s not very appropriate because while I was happy to be his friend, no way am I getting back together with someone who cheated. He said who said anything about a relationship. I said well, I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t do the casual hook up thing.
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Then I tried to stand up. I couldn&#x27;t. Within a few minutes I had gotten so drunk my legs wouldn&#x27;t work. Later I found out I was sick on the floor but I don&#x27;t really remember that. Herbert pushed me onto my back and tried to kiss me. It&#x27;s at this point that girls can freeze. Because of my drunkenness, or maybe because he was a &#x27;friend&#x27; I didn&#x27;t freeze. I was raped sober a year before that, and I froze, shut my eyes and waited for it to end. This time, I tried to laugh while pushing him off, placate him, and he rolled off me. I tried to playfully say I told you I don&#x27;t do hook ups. Then he jumped on me again, this time grabbing my hand and shoved it down his shorts. Now I felt I had no choice but to fight, and I did. I scrapped with him, slapping feebly at him but it was enough to put him off.  
&amp;nbsp;  
What he did next is a little dark. Realising he was getting nowhere he got up and left the room. I lay on the carpet wondering what was even happening. And the door opens, he sent a guy I didn&#x27;t know who was bigger than him to have a go. Now if I&#x27;d been sober at this point, I could well have frozen up. I didn&#x27;t freeze, I fought this guy even harder than I fought Herbert. He managed to jam his tounge in my mouth but nothing more, because I just kept wriggling and scrapping. He gave up within minutes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
He left the room and Herbert came in and yup, tried again. At this point I found I was able to stand and basically crawled up stairs to where everyone else was. Herbert is not a nice person, he&#x27;s been cruel to many girls that I&#x27;ve known and I don&#x27;t really know how far he would have gotten if I&#x27;d had the freeze reaction. But I think I have a good idea.

&amp;nbsp;  
I&#x27;m not really sure why I&#x27;m sharing this. I&#x27;ve been wanting to tell someone for a decade, and I guess having experienced freezing one time and having a fight reaction another time had given me a perspective into both. </div>

            <div class="content">

this is gonna be a long post but i really need to get this off my chest. it all started when i was maybe 10-11, my male friends would tell me how theyd fuck me and how id make an amazing sex doll &quot;jokingly&quot;, another male friend also begged me for nudes for maybe 1 hour on end also &quot;jokingly&quot; but it all really started when i was 12 and started dating this internet dude (he was 14 turning 15) who would only ever talk about how horny he was he once even asked me &quot;what would u do if when we met id put my hands in ur pants even if u didnt want it&quot; and sometimes would even ask me to explain how my naked body looks and tell me to send him pics of similar bodyparts to mine so i wouldnt have to send him nudes. this is a long story but these are just a few and ive let the worst for last

i met this boy when i was 13 (he was 16), we re gonna call him G. i got into his circle through a friend i reconciled with. G had a gf and ended up cheating on her with me when i thought we were just friends, he told me he was in love w me (he said they broke up and stopped speaking to her) but apparently he js ghosted her and never asked me to be in a relationship he js assumed it. anyways this boy kept pushing my boundaries. before him i didnt even know how to kiss. at first it started normally, i remember he asked me once if he could touch my boobs and i said yes and then said &quot;but i dont want you seeing me naked or touching me anywhere else without asking first, especially my vagina&quot; there it goes from here...

he would grope me at parties in front of everyone and i remember one night when i was in the bathroom and he said he ll stand by the door to check if anyone enters and i was terrified that if he got turned on and came in the bathroom i would freeze and feel guilty for not being able to say no.  he touched my vagina and pretended to be sorry because he didnt mean to make me uncomfortable, he would tell me about how nice it would be to have sex with me though he wants to wait because im young and his mom told him to and i believed him because i was little and in love. he would say he wants to fuck me because im a virgin and id be super tight and then tried demonstrating how tight virgins are on my forearm idk why i remember this. me and my friends were supposed to spend new years with his group and i remember telling him id love to see him on nye and he just said &quot; if we get drunk i cant promise we wont have sex&quot;. he would send me memes asking for pictures of my boobs and say &quot;but im not gonna ask u properly just send if u want because then youd say im pressuring u like the other girls&quot; and sometimes id try to send him nudes and id chicken out right before and he d just say how frustrating it is that i cant keep my word. he would also send me pictures of his dick constantly and tell me how he has wet dreams about me. he would masturbate with me on call and show me what porn he watched. i thought he loved me and i thought i was in love. he even told me &quot;he&#x27;d rape me&quot; once and said &quot;oh i thought it meant the same thing as rail&quot; (rail was used a few years ago as a term for fucking) but he knew it didnt and even knew about that online dude that used to joke abt raping me.  and then he got back with his ex because &quot;he loved me a lot but she could give him good sex&quot; we kept contact and he would tell me about how he she would give such good blowjobs and she was always down for sex but she was annoying and whatever else(poor girl my heart goes out to her and i hope she healed from what he did to her aswell). also would put my hand on his dick and keep it there for a little and then say &quot;im sorry i forced you i couldnt control myself&quot;

my BIGGEST issue is sometimes i didnt say no. sometimes i participated. sometimes i liked it. the more time i spent with him the more sexual i became. i thought it was normal and forced myself to like it so i could continue loving him.

ever since then i feel like my only worth is my body. like i must try to get men to sexualize me to like me. i cant say no to anything in the moment. i feel worthless and i feel like maybe i am just desperate for sex and i try to lie to myself that these experiences are what harmed me. i feel like because it wasnt rape it cant affect me like this.

i have a partner now, we had some issues in the past but we are repairing and he is an amazing boy and i love him very much. i still feel like i am only meat to him. i feel like he enjoys my presence only if i am sexualizing myself. i feel like if i say no to having sex with him he will leave. he is not like that, and even if he doesnt even really prioritize sex and he has never pushed me to do anything, has always been patient and incredibly careful with me, hell he even stops to check on me if i moan differently to see if he accidentally hurt me and yet i still feel like if i dont present myself as this incredibly horny, sexy woman he will leave . he is the first man i ever had sex with and i regret it so much. not because it was bad or because i regret having sex with him but because i feel like bcz i had sex with him he will never see me as human ever again. ill only ever feel like a body now. i feel used. i feel like i lost the only thing i had left of my innocence. now i dont have anything. my body doesnt feel like its mine anymore. i wish men would just forget i have a body. i wish my partner would forget i have a body. i wish he would never see my body as sexual again i dont want to feel like meat when im naked anymore. hes not wrong for being turned on by me and he does everything right i am just flawed and i hate myself for it. i hate myself for not knowing better when i was young and turning out like this. i cant believe anyone would ever love more than my body and i think its entirely my fault</div>

            <div class="content">(TW) 
Hi, this is really hard to say and I don’t really know where to begin. So, I (f,18) have a best friend (m, also 18) and I think he might have assaulted me but I’m honestly not sure. 

This situation is really weird because we used to date when we were 16/17. 

The first time I think he might have assaulted me was while we were dating, when we were 17. Basically, we both went to a party at his friends house and we both were pretty drunk. When I was leaving to go home, he wanted to walk me out to my car, and we started making out for a few minutes around the corner from where my mom was waiting for me. He started trying to finger me, and I tried to push his hand away twice before he stopped. He was really drunk at the time so personally I didn’t consider it assault until I told a friend about it. 

The second time, we were drinking again, and we were still dating. He had two or three drinks so he was tipsy. I got some personal news that day so I drank a lot more. I was kind of at the point where I couldn’t walk/see straight. Admittedly I initiated it, but from what I can vaguely remember, he made me get on my knees and he held my head up. 

The last time was two days ago. We’re no longer dating but we consider each other best friends. We’re both single, and he has been struggling a lot more with being single than me (he says he feels lonely and sexual frustrated). The whole day he was making “jokes” about me blowing him (for example, if I asked to do his makeup he’d say “only if you suck my dick first”). It eventually got to the point where he said he was going to start walking home and I told him to stay longer. He said the same thing again. I said “okay” half as a joke, half to see what he would do. He pulled out his dick and put it close to my mouth. I told him I didn’t want to. He started getting upset about still liking me and wanting to fuck someone again. I feel like this is my fault, but I let him rub his dick against me to feel better. But he tried to do more, tried to finger me, put the tip in, etc. When he did leave, I broke down, and I’ve been having flashbacks to it since. 

I’m honestly not sure if any of this was assault, compared to what other people have mentioned on here. When I’ve brought this up to him he’s argued that it wasn’t, because he was drunk too, I initiated it, I consented etc. I really just want clarity right now. Thank you if you read this much :)</div>

 I’ve been thinking more about it lately but I’m having trouble recalling the event and details without reading what I wrote back when it happened. I’m reposting because there’s probably new people who would be okay listening to me. 

idk if it’s a gray area situation or what

I’m just looking for different advice, opinions, perspectives on this, to help me process it.


So a few weeks ago I came home for the weekend, and I was planning on going out with some friends. They ended up canceling last minute. This guy I hung out with once saw my location was on, and he reached out, asking if I wanted to go to the beach.
 
I agreed to go because I drove all the way to that area, got dressed up, and had nothing else to do. He told me to drive to a parking lot, park, and that he&#x27;ll pick me up from there. I parked my car, and then I got into his car. We drove 5 minutes and parked in front of his house. We talked and caught up because it had been a year since I&#x27;ve seen him.
I asked if he wanted to go to a party or a club (I wanted to go somewhere public with people). He said sure, but we realized the clubs would be closed soon as it was already close to 2am. As I texted someone to see if the party was still happening, he went inside to grab alcohol and blankets just in case we went to the beach instead.
The party got canceled, and he said we should just go to the beach, and I said sure.
He came back with a green water bottle filled with whiskey and a little bit of soda. In his car, we started drinking, and he kept bringing up how he wanted to hook up in the past, but we never did. He asked me if I&#x27;d want to hook up with him tonight, and I said something about how I would if I wasn&#x27;t going to school in Miami, and I also said I liked someone else at my college.
I also said that I think because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt his feelings. I just really didn’t feel like doing anything like that tonight I didn’t even want to go out that much. I could tell he was annoyed by that. But he kept complimenting me and massaging my shoulders, and just like being flirty. I didn&#x27;t really know what to say because I did not want to create conflict, but the whole time I had the person I liked in Miami on my mind.
I had a few sips of the whiskey he brought, but I finished the two white claws I had brought with me. After chatting and drinking, we eventually walked out to the beach, picked a spot near the access point, we set up blankets on the sand. We got under the blankets because it was so cold. I really just wanted to sit under the stars, drink, and catch up; I wasn&#x27;t in the mood to do anything else because I really did not even feel like going out that night, plus I really liked someone else. Almost immediately after we got out there, he started touching me. He like rolled on top of me and was reaching under my clothes and took my bra off. I didn&#x27;t really know what to do because I didn&#x27;t want to upset him, but I kept reminding him that there&#x27;s someone else in the picture and that I don&#x27;t want to do this right now. He started fingering me and trying to make out with me, but I kept turning my head so he couldn&#x27;t kiss me, and I was trying to push him away and telling him that I shouldn&#x27;t do this. He kept saying that it doesn&#x27;t matter and that he won&#x27;t tell the person I like.
I kept telling him that I shouldn&#x27;t do this right now, I want to respect the other person I like, and that we should stop. He was like un-doing his pants, and I didn&#x27;t really know what to say because he wasn&#x27;t listening to me. In my head, I thought I&#x27;d just go along with it until it got too far because I&#x27;m bad at saying no to people at times, and I didn&#x27;t want to cause a problem. I felt drunk walking to beach and at this point I could still feel drunk but I felt myself sobering up because I was confused about what was going on. I told him that some things he was doing felt good, but we shouldn&#x27;t take it further, but he kept wanting to have sex, and I told him I didn&#x27;t want to. He didn&#x27;t seem to take that into account. Maybe because I was saying it in a lighthearted flirty way? He put a condom on, and in my head, I was like, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to do, I don&#x27;t want to do this right now.&quot; 
He kept reaching under my skirt and trying to put his penis in but I kept trying to push him away, and twisting and turning to keep him from having sex with me.  He was kissing my neck really hard, and he just wouldn&#x27;t get off.  He kept using more force, which surprised me. I said, &quot;okay, we&#x27;re not having sex right now,&quot; and I was saying it nicely; I was being overly friendly or playful because I didn&#x27;t know how to handle the situation, and I&#x27;m never really aggressive with people. At one point I guess he was frustrated because I kept moving, and he was holding my arms above my head to get me to stop. The whole time his penis was right near my vagina but I am not 100% sure if he actually put his penis in because I was trying hard to move and push it away. I think he did a tiny bit because I asked him, &quot;did you just put it in?&quot; and he didn&#x27;t really answer me.
 
But at one point, the condom fell off because I kept trying to like move him away. That got me worried because if this was going to happen then, that would make it worse. He managed to overpower me more by gripping and holding down my arms tighter, and I said: &quot;you don&#x27;t even have a condom on we can&#x27;t do this&quot; just to get him to stop or distract him. I also kept saying, &quot;why don&#x27;t we just finish drinking and just chill and talk&quot; to distract him. I was surprised because he had gotten so aggressive by like gripping my arms tighter or just trying to get me to stop moving. He just kept saying, &quot;we are doing this&quot; and &quot;why not, what&#x27;s the big deal.&quot; After a while of wrestling and pushing him away and trying to talk him out of it, I told him I really had to go to the bathroom, thinking it would get him off. After a lot of arguing, we both stood up and went to the bathroom.
 
Once we both stood up and I thought that we were getting up to leave, I sanded off one blanket, and I saw that my phone was buried in the sand, and he was like “dang” cause there was so much sand in my phone. I told him I had to get up early the next day to go back to Miami for school. I was so confused about what happened, and I was saying things to distract him again because I just wanted to leave.
 
We started getting our stuff. He handed me one blanket and wrapped it around my shoulders. Then out of nowhere, he  like tackled me into the sand, and he was on top of me again. I was on my stomach now, and the blanket was still around me, and sand got in my eyes. He was trying to put his penis in again I think, and it seemed so easy for him to do because I was wearing a skirt. This was when I got pretty scared, and for a moment I thought maybe I should just let it happen. But I started saying it louder for him to get off I was like, &quot;get the f*** off of me, wtf stop.&quot; I kept trying to squeeze my legs tighter, and I managed to turn around, and he was still on top of me, but I was facing him, and I was like &quot;we&#x27;re not doing this you&#x27;re a cute guy, but I&#x27;m not doing this okay&quot;. I said that to not make him mad, and I did use to like him a year ago. Somehow I negotiated with him and to get him to get off.
 
When he was still on top, he was saying things like if I don&#x27;t have sex with him, I have to give him a blowjob as if I owe him that or something. He also said that he&#x27;d give me $50 or $100 to have sex with him. And I said &quot;I don&#x27;t want your money this is insane&quot; I also said &quot;stop you just want to sex with someone tonight&quot; and he said &quot;no I want to with you&quot; but I told him that&#x27;s not happening and I told him you can go get any girl you want this doesn&#x27;t have to happen right now.
 
I asked him when we were walking back to his car &quot;did you know this was going to happen&quot; and he said no, then I asked, &quot;then why did you think I wanted to do that or that was okay&quot; and he just said that he didn&#x27;t know.
 
I feel like I said things so I wouldn&#x27;t make him mad or hurt his I also brought up how I hooked up with his friend a while ago to maybe weird him out or distract him and get him off, or I said it because I was mad.
 
But he did say if I hooked up with his friend, then why shouldn&#x27;t I hook up with him too. He just seemed really desperate to do all this; he said earlier he hadn&#x27;t had sex in a long time. When he was gripping me tighter, I kept saying to him that this isn&#x27;t okay and asking &quot;what are you doing,&quot; &quot;is this for real right now,&quot; &quot;we aren&#x27;t doing this okay,&quot; and he kept saying &quot;I hear ya&quot; but would not stop.
Or he would say &quot;okay fine&quot; and stop for a second then I&#x27;d loosen up then he&#x27;d go back to trying to have sex again. We left the beach finally, and he had to drive me back to my car. I even apologized to him because I felt bad or felt like I did something wrong cause he was annoyed or disappointed.
 
We got to the parking lot where my car was parked. I was about to leave, and while I was saying bye,  I asked him if he was okay to drive cause we were drinking. He then reached over and kissed my neck really hard, and he reached under my skirt and said, &quot;just have to feel what I&#x27;ll be missing&quot; or something. I just didn’t know what to do or say.
I looked in the mirror on the way home, and there were so many hickeys on my neck; he said he hoped he left some to make the guy I liked jealous. I texted him about it a few days later saying that he really scared me and he said he was sorry and that that he was drunk. But he sent me a nude pic a few hours after that. I am not sure what to think exactly because it could be considered a gray-area situation because I agreed to hang out with him</div>

            <div class="content">I’m not sure if this is the best place to post this but I feel as if I have nobody to speak to, and I’m too afraid of what people would think if I did tell them face to face. I’m struggling majorly to come to terms with what happened last night, because I just don’t understand why it happened and what it would be considered. Thankfully I was able to be given the day off from my summer job even though I only told them I was sick. Which is partially true as I am feeling physically very drained but my head feels far worse. I can’t concentrate. 


Background: I met a very attractive guy on Tinder who promptly invited me to the beach one evening. I agreed, and we had what I believed to be a very nice night together. We had (protected) sex then he dropped me off, and since then we were Snapchatting regularly. I know it’s stupid to attach myself to someone I’d known for such a short time but believe me, I really felt something for this guy. Just coming out of a toxic relationship it was like a breath of fresh air. However, I was so scared of coming across as clingy or needy that I waited for him to make all of the first moves, including making plans to hang out (I realize there’s nothing weird about girls being the one to propose dates). 


Last night he surprised me by asking me if I wanted to go smoke with him and his friends. Excited to spend time with him again I agreed. When I get there he’s a lot less hands-on than he was previously (I don’t know how better to describe it) and in a moment of insecurity I assumed he’d simply lost interest, so I let it go. We drink and smoke, with Tinder guy leaning against the wall and myself and his friend lounging on a bunk bed. At some point the drink and the smoke hit me extra hard, and it’s around that point that Tinder guy leaves to get more weed leaving me and his friend to converse. 


The conversation was friendly enough until Tinder guy’s friend mentioned he wanted to take me upstairs to his room. 


I made it clear that he was not the person I was romantically interested in and tried to redirect the conversation. We go out back and smoke some more, and by this point I can’t keep it together. I’m a stumbling mess. I kept trying to converse with Tinder guy but he just didn’t seem interested at all, which was such an odd switch up from our last meeting. At some point Tinder guy takes off to apparently get food, leaving myself and his friend alone for the second time. 


Somehow I end up upstairs. I have no clue how this happened but the most that I can remember is that he was spooning me on his bed while a movie played, which I obviously couldn’t follow. I kept trying to scoot away but I was having a hard time staying awake let alone putting up a fight. He began to grope me, and soon it evolved into kissing me on the lips and sticking his tongue in my mouth. I didn’t want him to and I said no but he continued. I can’t remember how hard I protested but obviously it wasn’t much, and that’s bringing me the most shame about all this, besides the fact that I found myself in this position at all. 


I’d not like to revisit the rest in too much detail, but essentially he ends up performing sex acts on me against my word although there is no penetration with his penis. After numerous sex acts where I am protesting he eventually gives up and I assume gets upset and says he taking me home, which at that point I am more than happy to do. In hindsight I shouldn’t have even gotten into a car with him afterwards and that alone makes me question even further how much I am responsible for what happened to me. 


Eventually I find out that Tinder guy was seeing someone else, and only invited me over so that his friend could sleep with me. None of this was told to me beforehand. The pain of being ditched like that is sort of non-existent but what I feel is a lot worse I think. I don’t know if they intentionally got me wasted as they are party types. As for Tinder guy, his friend kept saying they were coming back but I didn’t see him again. 


I sent him a message before I ended up passing out, and planned to send another in the morning only to find out he’d deleted me from Snapchat. I have his number but honestly I don’t want to speak to him again. I’ve never been treated this way and it doesn’t even seem like it could be a possibility. 


I also don’t know if what I went through is considered a sexual assault. I said no but I don’t know how much I fought, and there was no penetration with his genitals. All I know is how I feel, and I feel ashamed. I feel hurt and betrayed. I also feel used. I would like to know what this would be considered from an outsiders perspective.</div>

            <div class="content">Throwaway for anonymity. An event happened three years ago on Halloween that&#x27;s bothered me ever since. Part of what bothered me about it is that I didn&#x27;t (and still don&#x27;t) know how to classify what happened. My best friend and I used to throw a Halloween party together every year. It just involved our close friends and acquaintances, nothing big or crazy. When I was 19, I decided to try out the whole scandalous costume thing, and dressed up as a French maid, with the thigh highs and whatnot. My best friend and I have a largely male friend group, and I got a lot of unwanted attention that night. At the end of the night, and after about 10 straight hours of drinking (not to the point of being wasted, just kept a steady buzz), I was trying to go to sleep on a couch. One of my male acquaintances, who I had always been on good terms with, came and laid down on the couch with me. I really just wanted to sleep, but I told him we could cuddle. He started kissing me, that I was mostly fine with too. I wasn&#x27;t interested in him at all, but it was whatever. It gets a little fuzzy, but at some point I decided to just give him oral to try to get him off so that he would leave and I could go to sleep. After a while he hadn&#x27;t come, so I decided to just give up, tell him to go away, and go to bed. I told him this, but he wouldn&#x27;t leave. I turned away from him so I was just lying facing the inside of the couch to not deal with him anymore. He pulled my pants down and started to trying to put his dick in me. I told him to stop. I told him it was rape. I remember trying to phrase those two sentences in alternate ways, hoping something would get through to him. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t hit him or do more. He kept calling me baby. He didn&#x27;t get it in because I stuck my hand between my legs and kind of shielded myself and kept pushing it away. After a little bit of him struggling to force himself inside me and me trying to deflect it, I started crying. He paused and I took the opportunity to jump up and lock myself in the bathroom. He had left by the time I came out. I texted him the next day and told him to stay the hell away from me. He apologized, but it didn&#x27;t change that it happened. I don&#x27;t know what to call this shitty event. Was it attempted rape? Sexual assault? Is it nothing at all if your attempted rapist doesn&#x27;t succeed? Afterwards I kind of wanted to report it to the police, but I didn&#x27;t know whether attempting to rape someone was a crime like actual rape. I feel like I brought it on myself by letting him kiss me and blowing him. I told a few of my friends. They somehow didn&#x27;t really care. I got invited to a 4th of July party the next summer, I got there and he was there. I only stayed for a few minutes because I couldn&#x27;t stand being in the same place as him. Sorry for the big wall of text and my likely unorganized writing style. I&#x27;m just trying to get some clarity on this.</div>

            <div class="content">This has taken up a lot of my mental space over the past six years. One night, I was at a friends house at a party and got way too drunk. I ended up being flirtatious with a guy, but then got tired and went to bed.

He came into the room after a few minutes and started kissing me. I was going along with it at this point. Then he started pressuring me to give him oral - I said no because I don’t like doing it and also if I do I like a freshly washed penis. He wasn’t happy but let it go. Then he wanted to have sex. I asked if he had a condom, he said no. I told him I wouldn’t without one. Suddenly he’s inside me, not through violence, it just happened. I shut down and let him do his thing - and he was so drunk he couldn’t even orgasm.

Next morning he asked if I could drive him home so I did. When I got back to my house I locked myself in my room just feeling numb and booked and STD screen.

Kicker is afterwards he bragged to our friend group he slept with me and I was a bad lay.

I never thought of it as rape. Rape happens in dark alleyways, rape is bruises and bleeding, rape is ... not that. But now I’m coming to terms with the fact this person ignored me saying no and made me feel cheap, and dirty, and worthless.

Why can’t we all do better.</div>

            <div class="content">My boyfriend has been on vacation in his home country for about 2 months now. His brother got married and he went because of that and to see his family. My boyfriend is Muslim and I am catholic and it’s been said to me from day 1 that he will not marry me because he is not allowed to because of his strict religious mom and background. He’s my first boyfriend I’m 24 about to turn 25 next week and he’s 26. Since he’s in his country I’ve been lonely since he’s my only friend my best friend and we don’t talk or call as much as I’d like because he has poor connection over there and is busy with his family and his family can’t know we speak lovingly to each other but they know about me I’m also very close to his brother who’s in the US with him and we’re studying together. 

When my boyfriend is with me in the US we don’t really go out or do much and I love dancing and listening to music but he’s turned into a homebody just focusing on his business and making money just to pay for rent. Now that he went back home, a mutual guy friend of ours likes to go out and I’ve been joining him and his friends to the bars and finally getting to really see the city life around me. I guess I developed a small crush on the friend I wouldn’t really even say that he would just innocently let me stay over and would put on music videos and let me be myself. 

About two days ago however it’s 4am and we got back to his place from the club and we played music videos and got on the couch and he brought a blanket. We laid down on the couch ready to fall asleep but our feet began to touch each other. We pressed our feet against each other and started playing footsies for a while. He started falling asleep and so did I and he asked if we wanted to go to the bed instead. I said sure since I’ve slept over in his bed before but he would stay on the couch. Next thing I know he’s also getting into the bed with me but I didn’t really think much of it I just thought we’d sleep next to each other especially because he was snoring like 5 minutes before that. 

We’re in bed and we begin talking and he’s asking me a lot of questions about myself like what all of my favorite things are and our feet are touching each other’s again and our legs get involved and we begin to intertwine. His hands then started touching my arm and he’s massaging them a bit. I feel him go for my boobs and at this point I block it off and turn to my side but I still let our legs intertwine. I’m laying down with my arms crossed over my chest but his hands still keep roaming. I eventually start caressing the hands that are roaming me and at some point maybe like 20 minutes of this going on he reaches for my breasts again. I let him feel it this time and we’re still talking to each other asking each other what our favorite things are and kind of ignoring the obvious. His touching my boobs massaging them but over my shirt. We then fall asleep in each other’s arms but nothing really happened after that.

The next morning we wake up at the same time and the touching begins again. This time I let him feel my breasts under my shirt and I start touching him too. I took his penis in my hand and just started touching it and I was interested since my boyfriend is the only one I know and I’m curious if the anatomy is the same for everyone if that makes sense. I don’t really like straight porn so I never really cared to look at other penises for fun. I feel him up and he’s touching my breasts at the same time and I get turned on. However, I’ll never let another man get inside of me or see me naked if that makes sense too. I just let him touch and explore and he let me do the same. This went on for a while until we decided to go get lunch with his friend. We get lunch and then I come back to his and chat for a bit with all his roommates and friends since we all know each other and everyone is aware I have a boyfriend. 

That same day we planned to go to a friend of mine’s birthday party and it was already planned. So I go back home take a nap get changed and go back to his so we can all go out again. We go out have a good time I’m meeting a lot of new people and this mutual friend we just act like friends I even call him brother and he calls me gangster and it’s just cool and we don’t talk about it. However, when the night is over and I’m drunk I realize I’m excited to sleep over again and to do what we did again but just that. It was intimate and nothing too far which I like since I’m too awkward and insecure as a person to ever let things get really sexual. Even with my boyfriend it took me a year to let him have sex with me. 

When we get back to his place he brings 2 other friends over and we’re just sitting drinking beers at like 3am watching music videos. At this point I want nothing more than to go to his bed and him join me and do the things we were doing before. I say okay goodnight everyone and head to his bed. I wake up at 7am and realize he’s not next to me and never came in. I go outside to the living room and see him sitting there with headphones on watching videos. I sit down next to him and he’s excited that I’m up and we begin talking. I couldn’t shake the feeling off so I ask him if he’s rejecting me. He asks what do I mean and I didn’t elaborate but he said he’s actually hoping if I’ll accept him. I said of course you’re my friend. He tells me he has insomnia so I’m guessing that’s the reason he didn’t come back with me. Around 3 hours later it’s 10am now and his roommates wake up and we’re just talking playing music videos again. I say okay is it cool if I take a nap, once again inside of me I’m hoping he joins. He says of course and I go to his bed. I’m laying there trying to fall asleep but all I can do is fantasize about what we did and I feel empty knowing he’s not coming. I text him why don’t you come and he said coming I just need some time. I said okay and just laid there. He then comes in after a little while and lays next to me. Our feet and legs intertwine again and his right hand is holding my left hand and we’re just laying there talking. He then asks if I want to see his drawings so I do and then he wants to put a movie on. I say sure and ask him how can I make a drawing since it was on his iPad. So while he’s putting on a movie I’m making a drawing and it’s very fun. 

He puts on shrek 2 and asks if I’m ready to fall asleep. I’m pretty awake now so I say not sure and then we continue watching. After a while I hear him snoring so I shut the laptop and this wakes him up. He puts the laptop away gets back into bed and the touching begins again. He’s touching my breasts and I feel him go to my vagina and I smack his hand. He lays off but I feel him trying to get on top of me and his mouth goes to my breast for maybe 5 seconds. He then lays down and my back is pressed to his chest. He begins kissing and licking my back and it’s a new and good feeling and I liked it. After that I think he stopped trying or just didn’t like the “teasing” anymore and intertwined our legs and he fell asleep. After our nap he right away got on his phone and called his crush since she kept calling him and then he called another one of his girl friends who asked him to grab dinner at that point. I pretend I’m asleep the whole time and he gets up showers and then leaves. I’m still in his bed and I guess I was just upset we didn’t do much after that. I don’t know what I was expecting to be honest. After 30 minutes of contemplating my life I texted him thanks for letting me stay over and bye and then I left. 

I’m now home and I forgot to mention that my Boyfriend texting me this morning saying “Why the fuck are you always at ___’s house? You don’t even tell me about it. So sus and you put your phone on silent I don’t like this” he has my location and I reminded him about the birthday party and that I stayed over again because it’s a far drive from our place. I’m currently staying at my boyfriend’s apartment since he’s in his country and I’m good friends with his roommate and we’re doing extracurricular activities together at school. I tell him I just stayed over and he says “ Imagine me going to a bitches house to take a nap when you’re out of town And say she’s my friend “ I lied and reassured him nothing is sus and I would never cheat on him. 

I feel guilty and I’ve been crying the whole time in part because I love my boyfriend and he loves me but also because the mutual friend disregarded me in a way when he woke up. I’ve just been in a really bad state looking for jobs and internships since I graduate from my masters in may and I’m just a really sad person. It also doesn’t help that I turn 25 soon and feel like my life is ending and there’s not much hope for me anymore. My mom is also very tired she’s 60 and still working and it’s tearing her apart. I kind of just hate everything and don’t know how to go out anything. My boyfriend comes back this Thursday to the US and we’re planning on moving into a new apartment together with his twin brother since the roommate I’m staying with currently and then are in a fight. I just feel like I’m in a really bad place and I kind of fear for what will happen to me especially because of the mind I have. This new apartment we’re getting to is my one chance to stay in the city I study at since rent is terrible and I don’t have another option. I also love him and I miss him dearly and I wishes he would just come back so I can feel some form of love again. 

I’m really sorry for my bad actions and my bad intentions and I hope God gives me what I deserve. How do I tell my boyfriend and how do I continue with my life knowing I did this. Please let me know and thanks so much for reading if you did. </div>

            <div class="content">TW I have been going through this whole forum. I haven&#x27;t slept. PTSD got triggered yesterday. I&#x27;m think of the purple adsuakts I&#x27;ve endured. 

How I was in an abusive relationship with a cover narcissist for years. How he sold my body after drugging me multiple times. How when I tried to get away from him some how one of his people found me. I was homeless living out of a car. I have been trying to detach myself from him for so long. I was abused by him and he plays victim. He isolated me starting when I first met him. Yet he was the only person their for me becaue anyone else he made sure to drive off. Yet had no issues taking me to a pimp who was know for having connections to the Epstein ring.  How he strangled me till I was unconscious and raped me until I woke up. I didn&#x27;t know till he told me.


How another person tried to manipulate me. How he is trying to blackmail me. As he had cussed me into a survival mode exhaustion. When in this state he adjusted me with animals. Like actual animals. It makes me disgusted and wanting to puke. 

How I was assaulted at gun point in my own front yard. I was  fifteen just after a Parker McCollum concert I saw with my girl best friend at the time. She turn to be one of my biggest bullies. 

How I went to a party with her before that and was raped by a football team after being drugged. I didn&#x27;t know that I was tapped by the football team until two years ago. I&#x27;m almost 21 now.

How iwa sin the backseat of a car with someone. Someone else was driving. During this drive I hooked up with this person while another watch. How when it got to far I tried to put space between us. How I asked him and he didn&#x27;t 

How I started to heal myself when a guy from bumble insert him self into me anal. How it hurt and let me bleeding because he didn&#x27;t use any lube. Yet I just messaged him the next day he crossed a biudnrinsnd I don&#x27;t do that type of thing with guys. 

How that trigger one of my first assualt encounters. Where the person I met at. Church fiction we had consensual sex but he would anal rape me. Yet I didn&#x27;t say anything. How another church guy forced me to oral. How I was stuck between him and a concrete wall. I said no to sexual things. He instead put  his finger into my sweat pants and understand then my vagina. Then he put penis inside if me. The next day I got a snap message he bought me a plan b and will give it to me at school. He was in a relationship.

How as a child I got raped and mostly by my siblings.  How my first kiss my my oldest brother and he want to teach me how to kiss and if any other guy would try an kiss me to hit them. How my other brother would have me watch porn and then recreate it. How we play doctors just like the actresses in the video. How my sister gave me hickies playing vampire. How she grinded on me. 

How some came into my apartment when I was drunk because i apparently invite him over. I never let him in myself. How he triggered me in the dark and yelled at him and asked him why my brother was in my room. Psa it want not my brother in my room this time.  

How think about one event just leads to another. How it lead to more self loathing and disgusting feeling.

I am almost 21. The same number of sexual assualt I have had. maybe it&#x27;s a little smaller then the number of sexual assualta I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve been drugged. I&#x27;ve been sold. I&#x27;ve been lied to. I don&#x27;t know my body count.  How I cry anytime some ask me that and I say a number which is a lie because I don&#x27;t know. How I&#x27;m stuck in this constant state of set back. All the while my abusers have families. The have been living a good life. While I struggle financially,socially, mentally, physically,and academically. Wondering what life would be like if none of it happened.

Sorry for all the edits.sorry for grammar and misspelled words. I am tired and cannot sleep. Does anyone else have restless nights like me?</div>

            <div class="content">My freshman year of college (age 18)  I was still friends with the group of people I went to high school with. I was still living at home, most of the other hs friends went away to school, but a group of boys stayed and lived in the dorm. We went out drinking a lot. All of us had so much fun together. We would drive and just listen to music, go on walks, do activities as a whole. I thought they loved me. I thought I loved them. 

I always told my mom growing up, if I ever kill myself, just know I was raped. I did not realize how gray it really is. It is NOT black and white. I was never taught about this type of rape. I thought the only rape that could happen was in a dark alley.

I was raped by who I thought was my best friend. Him and another boy (with my girl best friend with us) carried me in with an arm over each shoulder into their dorm one night after going out to a bar. I never slept in the boy best friend&#x27;s room due to I knew he liked me, and I did not want to cause confusion because I had told him (multiple times) that I did not like him like that. They put me into his bed. I woke up confused, maybe still drunk a little, and in a bed I NEVER slept in, with his arms wrapped around me. I assumed it was just because we were friends and it was more of a twin size bed and he&#x27;s a large guy. 

I will never forget the feeling of being at work in the back room. A couple days after that night. He texts me, &quot;Can we talk about the other night?&quot; &quot;what about it?&quot; &quot;We had sex...&quot; I dropped to the ground. I still had a couple hours left in my shift. Instant anxiety attack. I had **no fucking clue what he was talking about**. I told him lets drop it. I did not know what to do. I tried to push it away. Not think about it. I still hung out with him. A month later I had fully convinced myself that I did this to myself. I ended up getting drunk again, fully aware, and we made out. I thought it would override that night. I thought well if I just accepted that night then maybe this would make it okay? 

It wasn&#x27;t until this past summer (age 21) that I came to terms with the situation. Multiple situations. In high school I was sexually assaulted in my mouth one night after being dragged in from a front yard by a boy I hardly knew and he laid me down and put his penis in my mouth. In high school I was drunk on the ground being fondled by a boy I hardly knew at a small party, yelling at him to get off me. It wasn&#x27;t until my boyfriend came in and punched him and kicked him out then moved me to a safe place. I thank him more than he knows for that.

I have stopped drinking heavily since then. I have stopped enjoying bars the way I used to. 

But I am loved. I am working through my issues. But I am loved. And it is okay that it took me a long time to realize I was raped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its okay if it took you a long time to realize, too.</div>

            <div class="content">TW: sexual abuse. Conflicted if rape/assault

Is this abuse? It fits definition but doesn’t feel right.


This is gonna be long... sorry 😅

So I was always so scared to lose my virginity because of it being drilled in my head that sex was sacred. I got drunk one night (dude was sober) when I was in college and went to a dudes apartment near mine (had mutual friends). I thought we’d mess around but not have sex. I was unaware he was in me until a bit (thought pressure was fingers). I had an outer body experience like wtf and my mind froze, but was then relieved my first time was over (I was 21). I went with it and kept going, kinda excited to “fit in” with others since I was a 21 year old virgin. He texted me the next morning and told me to buy plan b. It hit me he wasn’t wearing a condom, and freaked out. I didn’t even think about it since I wasn’t aware he was in me at first and taken aback. So my dumb brain thinks he likes me, cause he texts me to sext sometimes. I would always say shit like “oh my god I can’t believe you took my virginity”. He rarely texts me back unless I offer to sext. The next time we see each other he tells me he wants to have sex, and I say no, I don’t wanna go that far, we can do other stuff. He pressures me ALOT and says he just wants one stroke. So I say okay. He does, and when I move away he throws a fit, but eventually gets over it. He then wanted to spend the night, but I had class early and said no (looking back I think I was uncomfortable). He ghosts me and I’m HURT. I brought this up to my therapist today because I have a lot of trouble with sex and some what scared/nervous. She pretty much was taken aback. This happened in 2016, and for some reason I now keep crying? I feel like rape doesn’t fit it. Violated maybe?

Ugh my troubles do not end there

Later that year, I’m brought to this party to meet this guy, but it was a BIG bday party for him so he brushed me off (idk if he knew he was suppose to meet me). So I got drunk and was talking to this dude about the rejection I felt from my dad and how I was made to feel ugly. He kept telling me I was beautiful and I was so happy. We go to the bathroom where he locks the door and tells me to turn around. So I do, but am sober enough to stop after like 2 seconds and say I’m uncomfortable but will give him a blowjob (was told about blue balls and I felt guilty). I don’t view this as any sort of assault, I wasn’t excited about it wasn’t penetration and I could have left and went downstairs easy. Later find out this dude was friends with the guy I was suppose to meet and told him about it. Bday dude hits me up later saying he wishes he could have met me but was busy and would love to come over. AGAIN, I’m dumb and think our mutual friend got in contact with him and we’d hang out and order dinner. So he immediately starts making out with me. He takes his penis out and I get the memo what to do, but REALLY did not want to, like at all. I didn’t say this and there was no reason for him to believe I didn’t want to. So while I’m giving him a blowjob he’s texting and on the phone, I felt like trash. I felt like I was just an object, this is clearly all he wanted. After he finished he asked if i wanted him to return the favor, I say no because I want him gone and he immediately leaves. The only guy I have seriously talked to since, I told because I felt guilty, but guilty because i felt like a whore (even thought I’m pro-hoe!!) that guys have talked behind my back and said I did this for them, almost like this was a service. I felt like a prostitute minus the pay. He told me later that day he no longer was interested in me. I feel like guys will leave now when they find out.

I’ve always shut things down with guys and haven’t had sex/done anything with anyone since 2017 when this happened, because I’m paranoid they only want me for that, then will leave. My therapist asked me what I would think if one of my clients said this (I’m also a therapist) and I’ve been crying all day. Is this assault? Or just shitty situations? I feel like it’s spitting on people who have been sexually assault, but also keep crying and feel like shit. I asked a fellow therapist if it was rape, but said it was a client (HIPPA safe of course!). She was very adimit it was rape, and encouraged me to add it to the “client’s” profile. I honestly don’t know what to think. I feel stupid making a post in this group for ACTUAL sexual abuse survivors. Thinking about a client telling me this makes me so sad, but it’s also just the culture at 21 that people just have sex, why would they know I was uncomfortable? At the same time, I’ve realized it’s effected me for 5 years now unconsciously? But it’s also been 5 YEARS, why is it just now effecting me?</div>

            <div class="content">I am not brave enough to post this publicly; I never want anyone in my real life to know these things about me or to feel bad for my situation. I don’t know if anyone will read this, but I want to get everything off my chest.

My introduction to sexuality was when I was 8 years old, I had a boyfriend at the time from school, and largely this was just a situation of curiosity. We were at his house hidden under the bed and we stripped out bottom halves, I had never touched a penis before, nor he a vagina, he was soft but I put him in my mouth. I don’t remember more of this experience; it was something of an introduction that I consider “normal”. 

When I was 10 I entered into a relationship with a boy who was a few years older than me, a friend of my older brother’s. In the beginning it was innocent, as a childish relationship should be. After a time we would be at his house and he would convince me to give him a blowjob – I didn’t know what one was, but he assured me it was normal and adults did it all the time, I would gag regularly and he would advise me to go home and brush the back of my throat with a toothbrush to reduce the sensation. We did this several times. I was nearly 11 when one night, at a local park, he asked me if I had ever “bled”. I didn’t know what he meant by this, I told him no and he pulled me into the forested edges of the park. I didn’t get a choice in the matter, he laid me on the ground and undressed me, while I made vague excuses that I had to go home or my parents would be worried. He tried to put his dick inside me but I was too tight, however he thought he had achieved his goals and proceeded to fuck the space between my legs as he held my wrists down until he was done. I didn’t want to. I remember someone passing nearby walking a dog and he held his hand over my mouth so I couldn’t make a sound. He told me he had done it all before, it was normal, but I felt something was wrong. I broke off the relationship the next day. 

I started to skip school (he was there) and self-harm. I continued doing that at the next school my mother put me into as well, many meetings with teachers followed. My mother was a child psychologist, she couldn’t understand the behaviour– my self-harm was hidden and I had never mentioned anything about the incident. At 13 after having continued the same trend my father came to visit one weekend to talk to me about my truanting. In the garden I removed my wristband and showed him the fresh cuts from the razor, I cried into his arms and that very same day he took me to live with him and attend the school he taught at. 

Things were relatively normal living with him, I stopped skipping school, I made friends, I accepted the reality of strange old men leering and whistling on the streets but this was “normal”. I enlisted into air cadets. It was there I met a man who was an adult officer, a flight lieutenant that was recently out of a long term relationship. Gradually we started speaking on MSN, he would keep it mixed, some days he would ask me what I would say if he asked me to marry him, other days it would be talking about what he wanted to do to me. I wanted to be an adult, he was 22 and I was 15. When my father and stepmother left for a vacation they let me stay alone at the house because I was old enough. I invited the guy over, where he took my vaginal and anal virginity that same night on my parent’s bed. I found both experiences painful but it was my choice. 

However at school I had a counselor, who had told me everything that I tell her is private and confidential, she can’t tell anyone. So I told her about it, I felt betrayed when she said she would have to tell my father, at 15 I was below the legal consent requirement of 16 and therefore this was considered both rape and pedophilia. My father was furious, he took my phone and called the guy – we were never to see each other again. The other guy was just on a rebound, he would flaunt other women around without a care, and I was hurt because I believed I loved him. 

At 16 I went on holiday alone for the first time and met a 22 year old who I fell for hard, I had been trying just to find a summer romance to get over my “broken heart”. It was the beginning of a long relationship, about 2 years in we moved to his country, I quickly became depressed – unable to work, study, no friends, not knowing the language, I was a hermit in the house and completely dependent on him. I begged to move back to my country, or to at the least see a therapist, he refused, he didn’t believe in depression – he said the only thing I needed to do was learn the language and everything else would fall in place. He told me I could leave but he wouldn’t follow and at the time I was still desperately in love with him, so I stayed. I was dealing with casual sexism all the time in the country, men would stop in their cars and tell me to get in to come have sex, there were flashers, sexual remarks from nowhere. 

I left my fiancé (we had engaged 1 year prior) late last year after being together for 7 years. But I felt desperately unwanted, seeking validation in the cinders of a failed relationship, I went out with the intention to have a rebound and I got obnoxiously drunk at a party. The first guy I slept with that night was attractive, I wanted to, but I was too drunk, we fucked anyway and I got friction burns during from the sofa so bad there are still scars. After this I was nearly at the point of losing my memory from the drinking, but another guy at the party was pushing all night, hunting all night, trying to lure me away. The first offered that I should come back to his home after the act – but he was a stranger, so I was afraid and refused. I stayed. The other guy who had been hunting was the host; quickly I found everyone else disappeared as I could barely walk. We slept together, which I regretted immediately not fighting against more. What’s worse, with both men we had been unprotected though I was on the pill, I found out a few months later I got chlamydia from one of them, which was exceedingly traumatic for me because I know better than that. 

A while later I had a friends with benefits situation going on with a guy from a club I was attending, he was too messed up from his last relationship to have another and so was I. But it was a very clinical situation, no kissing, no cuddling, just to fuck and move on with our day each time, so I called it off. From the beginning he had also been asking for anal, but I had always refused – I found it painful. One night we went out with some others from our club and the man that had been supposed to drop me home tried to kiss me, I called the FWB guy and he saved me from the clutches of this older, married man and took me to his home with some of our friends. We all got high after already being a bit tipsy, my comprehension reduced dramatically. At one point our other friends left and he got closer to me, begging to have one more night together, but I was on my period I told him, searching for excuses. So he started insisting please, let me fuck your ass, come on, it will be nice, please, let’s do it. I don’t remember actually saying yes at some point, just weakly saying no each time he asked, but as he pulled my trousers down I didn’t fight him and soon enough we were doing exactly what he wanted. It wasn’t a bad experience ultimately but also not what I wanted. 

The depression never went away fully since it started 5 years ago, I always thought in strangely kind of romantic manner about how much of a relief it would be to kill myself. After the breakup I started self-harm again, just small ones, cutting the back of my wrists or up my arms and legs, just to feel this adrenaline rush. I moved to another country for a while and had many thoughts on my daily commute about just walking out in front of that train and ending it all, just to escape the pain. At one point I drank 2 bottles of wine in an attempt to kill myself by alcohol poisoning, only succeeding in making myself very violently sick. My sister has depression, so none of my family knows about any of this, I see how they worry about her, how concerned they are, I don’t want that for me. But I am so tired sometimes, I try to think of what I want in life and so often my only response is “What do I want? I want to die. Just let me rest.” But I am always a coward and never enact anything. I don’t want to hurt others in my life, so I continue to fight, alone. I have looked at therapy, but it is expensive and I feel so damaged in so many ways and I don’t want to bother anyone.

I have since stopped all of that (self-harm and any actual attempts), but the thought of suicide is only a bad day away. I have become somewhat reclusive; I’m not ready to have a relationship though I get various offers all the time. I have concerns all of this affected my sexual preferences in a way, my fantasies and fetishes are very much leaning toward hardcore BSDM, rape, humiliation etc. which feels incredibly fucked up considering my history. Many people I had considered friends while I was in a relationship have let me know they have far greater intent than that, even if they are married or otherwise involved. Generally I do not trust men anymore; I am unwilling to become vulnerable to them again. 

I suppose this was just to vent, I don’t think anyone will have read all of this but I just wanted to get my “me too” story out there in my anonymity. Sorry for the disjointed story, I tend to repress all of this all the time so it comes and goes with intense clarity and emotion. If you did read it all, thanks for listening.</div>

            <div class="content">So I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I&#x27;m in college but not of the legal drinking age. My fault for having too much (maybe 3 cocktails).

I went to a party with some friends who are all big partiers and usually just go out to meet guys and hookup.

So at one point during the night I was dancing and grinding with this guy. It was fun and felt really good. However, as the night went on he got....to handsy and to pushy. The first time he pulled me really close onto him I laughed it off and pushed back a little.

The 2nd time though he grabbed my butt and pushed his dick onto me and grinded. I should have stopped him, I should have pushed him off and said no. But he kept at it. I hate myself for allowing it because soon enough I had an orgasm.

As soon as that happened, I almost violently shoved him off and ran off. I ended up throwing up outside.

My friends have no idea. They just think I got too drunk and got in a foul mood.

But since then I&#x27;ve withdrawn. I lie in bed crying. I have barely spoke to my boyfriend.

I can&#x27;t tell him what I did because it&#x27;s my fault. I cheated though at the time I know I should have said No. If you cheat, you&#x27;re atleast supposed to have enjoyed or wanted it. I didn&#x27;t. I hate that I allowed it. And the orgasm sickened me.

The worst part of this is, my LDR BF and I vowed to take it slow. We&#x27;ve had oral sex but he&#x27;s never made me orgasm (I come close though). He&#x27;s going hates me if he knows my first orgasm with a guy wasn&#x27;t with him. </div>

            <div class="content">Hello, this might not be the right place to type this nor the right time but I&#x27;m pretty down right now and I believe at least this is the one place where people might&#x27;ve been put in a similar situation before.


So to start it off I&#x27;ll tell a little bit about the context of what happened yesterday, I&#x27;m a male, 20 yrs old from Norway who&#x27;s currently on a much needed vacation in Zanzibar, I&#x27;m here with my family and in general we have enjoyed ourselves. Last night me and my brother were looking for someone around our age to talk to during the later parts of the evening, we&#x27;d watched the champions league match earlier and enjoyed maybe 3 or 4 small beers during the match so I was a little tipsy at most. As we go along the beach we don&#x27;t really seem to find anything or anyone so we&#x27;re thinking about heading back towards the hotel and calling it a night, but just as we&#x27;re right by we hear someone shouting at us, naturally as we were looking for socializing we stopped and it was a local guy in his 20s who was going to a local club nearby. A little skeptical at first we discuss it together but agree on joining him as it could be exciting at the least, so together with him (was actually just a nice guy) we walk along the beach for maybe 20 minutes before we go into some alleys and arrive at a really local run down place which maybe has around 50 locals in it and we&#x27;re the only &quot;white&quot; there so naturally we stick out. 

So we hang out there, dance a little bit and talk to the people there, generally having a good time. After maybe 2-3 small beers I go for another round (note I&#x27;m a pretty social guy so I&#x27;m very used to drinking and I was not drunk at all at this point) and after ordering my beer I foolishly turn my back to my drink as I&#x27;m talking to the other guys at the bar. Can&#x27;t remember really when I finished my drink but after a little while I suddenly just felt extremely intoxicated, this is where I should&#x27;ve grabbed my brother and went out but foolishly I thought maybe I was just drunk or something, so I find my brother and he&#x27;s dancing with some local (gorgeous) girl so I start dancing in close proximity not really talking to him, can&#x27;t really remember 100% what happened next but suddenly some girl maybe twice my age starts dancing with me and shortly thereafter grabs my dick like literally sticks her hand in my boxer and starts semi jerking me off, me not at all at my full self don&#x27;t really understand most of it and I&#x27;m letting it happen for a short amount of time until she leads me outside dragging me along basically, drops my pants and starts blowing me. Next thing I now she drops her pants and starts fucking my basically half limp dick, it goes on for maybe 30 seconds before I manage to get away from it and she starts nagging me for money, I respond that a) I don&#x27;t have any more money on me and that b) I never wanted this but my words are extremely slouched. I go back inside and find my brother and tell him I want to leave and we leave shortly after. I tell him I got a blowjob and he tells me not to worry, and I don&#x27;t really feel like telling him everything so we go to bed. When I wake up I feel absolutely horrible and defeated and tell him about the whole ordeal and he almost starts crying as we&#x27;re afraid I might&#x27;ve gotten HIV, my watch is of course also stolen (at least the girl got her money :/) but that&#x27;s the least of my worries, we go meet my father and tell him about it and he starts getting stressed out aswell. Do a check with the doctor (although it&#x27;s too early to find anything in your blood) and it comes out negative, but we tell him that we need to get PEP which was something I found online which could potentially stop the disease if taken early enough and hopefully we&#x27;ll get it tomorrow. So the entire day my brother is super worried while I try to stay strong not really managing to look anyone in the eye but seeming pretty alright with the whole thing. 

In reality I&#x27;ve been on the verge of a collapse all day, incredibly afraid I might&#x27;ve gotten hiv or something else and just feeling stupid and angry at myself. Never really thought about worrying about my drink as I&#x27;m usually not in risk of that, but I should&#x27;ve understood how vulnerable I was in that situation. I don&#x27;t really know if I was raped or not but the general feeling is horrible and I don&#x27;t know how to bounce back from this at the moment. Don&#x27;t really care that much for responses but at least if someone reads it feels maybe a little bit better. Currently laying in bed in the hotel room after passing out at 23:00 but waken up at 3 by my father who was locked out of his room somehow so his key card wouldn&#x27;t work. I have no idea how I&#x27;m gonna fall asleep now, it&#x27;s 5 in the morning, have a doctors appointment at 10 and I just can&#x27;t stop thinking about all the potential consequences and the general horrible feeling I have. Don&#x27;t really blame anyone but myself as I can see the situations of the other parties involved but it feels really bad as I generally look at myself as a really kind guy and this really destroyed me.

Sorry for formatting, bad language and wall of text as I&#x27;m pretty tired psychologically and I&#x27;m typing this on my phone..

            <div class="content">About 3 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend. We didn&#x27;t speak in a normal way after the breakup. This saddened me because I hoped we could be friends, but I understood she was having a hard time so I tried to do my part and stay out of her way and to not push for friendly contact. 

Last Friday night I was very drunk and stoned. This evening I met my ex-girlfriend by chance at a club. A month ago this happened aswell, in this case, she made a scene and started yelling at a friend of mine because she thought I was flirting with her. So naturally I was careful. Instead of making a scene again, she surprised me by talking in a normal way for the first time in months. 

The situation made me very happy because I thought this might be the start of a more or less normal friendship. Quickly it turned more and more sexual from her side though. First she told me it would be a good test for us if we danced until closing like we used to and afterwards wouldn&#x27;t have sex it would mean that we maybe could be friends. So naively I agreed and we danced until closing. Afterwards she tried to kiss me but I avoided her and proposed that it was time to go to our separate homes and to call it a night. 

She clearly had other plans though, what followed were 2 hours of me trying to take my leave and her trying to convince me with: saying what she would do to me, complimenting our sex, talking a lot about the size of my penis, but also insulting me, talking about all the ways in which i supposedly wronged her, trying to make me jealous by talking about the people she had sex with, after which she came back to the point that sex with me would be much better. 

In this situation I consequently tried to stay polite but also tried to get away from it, just because i thought it would be a bad idea, for her aswell as for me. Eventually I tried walking away from it, but she followed me. 

After this time she told me ok, let&#x27;s not have sex, but maybe we can smoke a joint at your place. Naively I agreed, thinking it will be alright. When we arrived at my place, she didn&#x27;t have a joint. I told her I was tired and tried to sleep. I said it was ok if she slept at my place. She went into my bed instead of the couch and i didnt kick her out. She tried to engage in sex again, but at least 4 times I told her to stop. I even had to pull her off me a couple of times.

When I was finally sleeping I eventually woke up to her giving me oral sex. After this I caved and we had sex. 

Since this time I feel weak, ashamed of caving in and being naive. But I&#x27;m not sure this is right, because I also believe in taking responsibility for my own actions and she didn&#x27;t force me, I just didn&#x27;t say no clearly enough.

What do you think?

Tl;Dr Me and my ex-girlfriend had sex after I tried to say (and said) no for at least 2 hours. Now I feel weak and ashamed of my weakness.

P.s. If this is the wrong subreddit for this question, please tell me, I don&#x27;t know much about reddit. But my gut told me this would be an understanding crowd, which also wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to put me in my place if I&#x27;m overreacting to this situation.</div>

            <div class="content">I&#x27;m gay and there is this friend of mine who I&#x27;ve heard does gay stuff when he gets drunk. I was thinking about maybe somehow letting him know upfront that I&#x27;d be open sexually if the situation ever arose. The reason I&#x27;m thinking about asking him this is because I&#x27;ve been going through a depression and lately this friend has been appearing in my mind a lot. I look up to this person and admire this person a lot, but sometimes I get intrusive thoughts of, &quot;If I could just suck him off just one time, I think I&#x27;d be happy for a long while.&quot; And also, one time this person casually mentioned that after enough drinks, they don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a guy or a girl down there after another friend (who has known the friend in discussion longer than I have) jokingly (I think) told me to suck the other friend&#x27;s (the one in discussion) dick. At the time I froze and awkwardly stood there until the conversation changed because I had no idea how to react to that. But now that I think about it, if I were ever going to bring this up, that would have been the perfect time to see if they were serious. Now months later, it would probably be awkward to talk to them about that now. Oh yeah, and since then some friends have told me other things about him when they would go out clubbing. But yeah, I don&#x27;t think he would be emotionally affected in any way if a blowjob or anything did happen and it would also make me happy to be able to do that so I don&#x27;t see any potential harm happening at first glance. I don&#x27;t have any STDs either. I know this all sounds weird, but I just needed to vent because it has been on my mind a lot lately and he has also been appearing in my dreams. I was even thinking about just writing all of these thoughts into a letter and giving it to him and...yeah. Have you guys ever been in any similar situations or have any advice and what would be the best thing for me to do? Thanks so much.</div>

            <div class="content">Hello everyone, I don&#x27;t want to waste your time if this doesn&#x27;t count, but I just feel really gross, like I&#x27;m disgusted in myself.

I&#x27;m 18, a freshman in college, I met a guy at a party last night. He was drunk out of his mind, and I was already taking care of my drunk friend, so I took care of him too. I sat down beside him and let him lean on me and talked to him so he didn&#x27;t pass out. I bought him water when he was leaving because I was worried about him. He layed down across my chest and said &quot;Your tits are nice, can I bite it?&quot; I said no, but obviously, he was drunk so he did it anyway. I kind of pushed him away, but I still held onto him because I didn&#x27;t want him to fall and hit his head. He wasn&#x27;t in his right mind, so I didn&#x27;t fault him for it.

Today, he met up with me at school because he wanted to thank me. One thing led to another, and we ended up in one of the bathrooms together. I&#x27;ve never even seen a penis before today, I&#x27;ve never done anything like this at all, and he wanted me to suck it.

I said yes, I did consent, but I didn&#x27;t like it and wanted to stop. I told him I wanted to stop and he said &quot;but you&#x27;re doing so well&quot; and forced my head back down onto him. He tried to take my pants off and I had to hold him away from me. We went on for a few more minutes before I told him I wanted to stop again, and he ignored me, he pushed my head back down. After that I didn&#x27;t say anything. I didn&#x27;t do anything about it. I feel like I don&#x27;t have the right to complain because I consented at first, and then when he didn&#x27;t stop I didn&#x27;t push him away or anything. I feel like this doesn&#x27;t count as SA, but at the same time I feel disgusted with myself. Why didn&#x27;t I stand firm and push him away? Why did I keep quiet? I can still taste it in my mouth, I hate it. I&#x27;m hungry but I can&#x27;t stomach anything right now. I feel like I&#x27;m being dramatic. Does this count or am I being bothered over nothing?</div>

            <div class="content">Tw- description of sexual moments, possibly SA
Hello everyone, i just created my first reddit account to share my story because i feel like i need to know if im just being oversensitive… 
I know for sure that the situation im about to describe is extremely fucked up and that consent was definitely not there but I have always needed to categorize things to be able to cope with them and i dont know how to categorize this.

The first time I met this guy was almost a year ago now, at a school party, me and my friends joined him and his friend to go to a club after. Both me and my friend made out with him in the car, we exchanged numbers but I never replied to his messages after. 
This march, almost a year later we randomly met at another party and he bought me a drink, but I was with my friends so I didn’t really pay much attention to him. He called me after the party because he still had my number, and he tried to convince me to come join him and his friends but I was already tired. He said he wanted to have breakfast with me and that he loves me which was hilarious as we didnt know each other at all and I couldnt even remember his name. But he texted me in a couple of days saying he doesn’t remember anything about the phone call and he left a note in his phone to reach out to me.

 I thought it was cute and decided to agree to go out with him even though I knew we didn’t have that much in common and I probably wouldn’t want anything serious with him,  but I always had a complicated relationship with men and have been thinking about working on spending more time with them and being more comfortable. 

Anyway the first time we hung out we were together until 3 am but nothing happened, our next date we went to his place but I was on my period so we didn’t have sex but did other things, so the first time we slept together was out third date. Im 21 and I only slept with girls before so this was officialy my first time having sex with a man. It was really good, he was really thoughtful and made me cum like 3 times which I didn’t expect. 

I now see that there were some red flags, like him not wanting to use a condom, saying it wouldn’t work because he is drunk and his dick won’t stay hard for long enough with the condom on etc. while I insisted on it and being responsible is really important to me. He knew that I havent slept with guys before because it was kind of obvious but he was really nice about it despite the fact his sheets were stained by my blood and I felt a bit stupid. Also he is 5 years older than me. 

Anyways. I knew I would probably never fall in love with him and that this was only going to be casual from my side. I have also considered not seeing him again after the first time we slept together but felt like this was just my issues speaking up and decided to go out with him again.

We went to see a movie, and had a couple of drinks at a bar after before going to his place at around 3 am and drinking some more, we talked in his living room for like 3 hours and he was being pretty vulnerable and I started feeling pretty bad about not yet telling him I don’t want a commited relationship right now. At around 6 am we started kissing and feeling each other up on the couch before moving to his bedroom, we had sex for like 30 minutes on and off because we were really drunk and tired, but during these 30 minutes he was becoming progressively more agressive. He choked me before (the first time we slept together) because I told him I liked it which I do, in a moderate amount. But this time he was literally choking me so hard I couldn’t breathe for a moment and audibly wheezed, leaving bruises on my neck which are slowly healing now (this happened 4 days ago) He also kept asking me to give him a blowjob but after I did he stopped me right before he came and tried to have sex with me again and i was just so drained and unresponsive at this point. I dont even remember everything clearly. 
After these 30 minutes I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back I was already super tired after not having slept for 22 hours, I put on my underwear and said I wanted to sleep. He kept touching me, fingering me, pulling on my thong from behind so hard it hurt, choking me, putting my hand on his penis etc. I kept saying I was tired, wanted to sleep, I was holding back tears because I just felt so violated and uncomfy and just saying  “No” but he didnt stop until I pushed myself away really strongly and said “Please stop” , to which he said “Youre so cold” and finally left me alone. I fell asleep crying for like an hour and after I woke up I decided I really didn’t have to worry about his feelings and asked him to let me out of the house because of work (I didnt have work)

I know this technically isn’t rape. I consented to parts of the intercourse, I didn’t expect the violence and I retracted my constent after a while without being respected. I feel angry and I feel used, Im only glad I really didnt have any feelings for him and feel absolutely okay with completely cutting him off, bot creating apologies for him in my head. 

I think I mostly feel really angry about not being able to protect my boundaries more even though I did the best I could and feel also proud of myself for taking care of myself afterwards and also just removing myself from the situation asap. I feel betrayed because I had felt safe with him and we had sex before so I just didn’t expect this. I know that he was really drunk but I don’t think that’s an excuse. I’ve been pissed throwing up in the bathroom drunk and never felt like hurting someone during sex or forcibly touching them.</div>

            <div class="content"> This happened over a year ago, I’ve just started thinking about it lately. Sorry if I’m rambling at all, I haven’t talked about this with anyone, and I sort of just want to vent about it.

My brother hosted a Christmas party at his house, back in our small hometown where I no longer live. A few old friends and people I used to know were there, one of which I used to know quite well, a few years before the party. I’ll refer to him as N. He used to work for my dad for several years, he was friends with my brother, and best friends with my ex while we were dating. He was generally a nice and trustworthy guy. 

We were all drinking at my brother’s house, and a bunch of my brother’s friends/acquaintances seemed to find it really funny to hit on me in front of him, and make “hot sister” jokes. I didn’t mind, I also thought it was funny, because I didn’t really take them seriously. N wasn’t at the party yet. Eventually we all went to the bar for a couple hours, where N joined us, and one of the guys that was hitting on me (I’ll call him K) started getting more persistent (buying me drinks, dancing with me, etc). I was fairly drunk at this point, and I vaguely recall his tongue in my mouth while we were dancing (with me not kissing back, just being confused? It was two-step, so he was dipping me at the time) then I sort of forgot about it, and carried on with the night. 

Eventually a bunch of us went back to my brother’s to wind down with a movie, including K and his buddy, but N was still at the bar I think. My brother went to bed during the movie, but some of us were still up. K and his buddy started cooking my brother’s food that I know he was planning on making for breakfast. My brother could smell it from bed and texted me to ask if I could stop them, so I went into the kitchen and told them to stop. 

K’s buddy replied with “I’d like to fuck you” (even though that doesn’t make sense as a reply to “that food isn’t yours, stop it”?)
I told him that it wasn’t going to happen, and K piped in with “Well, I will.” I said, “no, you won’t.” So he took a creepy step towards me, stared into my eyes, and said “yes I will.” I got major “i won’t take ‘no’ for an answer” vibes. 

I left the kitchen, while they continued to cook the food, and told my brother about the whole exchange. He was furious and kicked them out, and made sure I knew how to lock the door to the camper trailer in his yard (he doesn’t have a spare room, so he offered me his camper instead of the couch).

After a bit, my brother went back to bed, while I watched a movie to calm my nerves with a couple other nice people who were also mad at the two guys in the kitchen. N was on his way to come crash at my brother’s since he lived out of town. He texted me and asked if he could stay in my camper with me, since the only unclaimed couch was just an armchair. I trusted him, and I was still worried about K coming and trying to break into my trailer or something, so I thought having another person there would make me feel safer. 

Eventually everyone went to sleep, and we went to the trailer. After we were in bed, N told me that he’s always had a crush on me, and asked if I felt the same way. It told him that I never saw him that way, and that I live 16 hours away from him anyways. He accepted that, and started talking about other stuff, while I tried to sleep because it was super late. 

For the following exchange, I was still fairly drunk, and very tired. I was sober enough to remember what happened, but still too drunk and tired to really react like I normally would.

I was almost asleep, then he asked if he could kiss me. I said “No, I don’t feel that way about you. I just want to go to sleep now.” He stopped talking for a few minutes, then said “Can I touch your boobs?” I said “No.” A few minutes later, I had started falling asleep, and he said “can I go down on you?” I said “No, I just want to sleep.” I fell asleep again, and he said “but I really want to have sex with you.” I told him to stop it. Next I woke up to him snuggling me and trying to shove his hand down my pants. I pushed his hand away and told him to stop and let me sleep. Then I woke up to him grabbing my hand and forcing it onto his penis.  It took more effort on my part for me to yank my hand away from his grasp, so that woke me up more than his other efforts. The effort then instantly made me nauseated, so I bolted out of the trailer because I thought I was going to throw up. He came with me to see if I was okay, and to offer me water. 

After I felt better, I went back to the trailer. He asked if it was still okay if he slept there. I wasn’t quite fully aware of what had happened—I remembered it, but it didn’t really fully click, if that makes sense. I said “I guess so.” And we went to sleep, and he stopped trying to touch me, and stopped talking. He left early in the morning because he didn’t want my brother to see that he slept in my trailer. 

We haven’t spoken a word since. I saw him once at a store last summer, and quickly pretended I didn’t see him, and went into a different room. He saw me, but didn’t say anything. Something makes me think that he thinks I was just avoiding him because he told me about his crush. I don’t even know if he knows he did something wrong. I don’t know if I should tell him that.</div>

            <div class="content">Hi all! Okay so I’ll try to keep this as short and non-convoluted as i can!

My gf and i started dating when we were 16 in highschool. We instantly connected from the very first second I’ve ever even spoke to her. We had problems of course but our love was always there. By the time we got to college (we ended up attending the same university) she was starting to get sick of it. We still loved each other but relationship wise things just weren’t working. I think it’s because i had undiagnosed depression and anxiety at the time but idk 🤷‍♀️. 

Eventually she broke up with me around February of freshmen year; i was devastated. Literally was trying to fight with every single thing i had to get her to take me back; i even made her a PowerPoint presentation as to why I loved and needed her. Well she didn’t wanna hear any of it

We remained broken up from February of freshmen year until the very first day of sophomore year. During the breakup we still hung out daily, talked daily, fucked multiple times a week. Looking back it all seems really unhealthy but i knew this girl was my soul mate from the bottom of my heart.

So while we’re broken up she ends up hooking up with 2/3 guys. One guy she kisses once and never talks to him again, okay cool! The next guy she took to a frat, hookedup with for literally hours and hours, then went back with him to his dorm and sucked his cock and let him eat her out! Okay so this hurt me a lot and i was very open with her about how damaging it was to me; but we were broken up i couldn’t do anything. Then she does all this stuff with another guy but then let’s him fuck her, she also let him grab her tits in front of people which i barely even got to do 😂 

Fast forward to senior year where i am today and we are together and literally the strongest we’ve ever been; I’m pretty sure we just went through so many growing pains together that we just needed some time. I was extremely heart broken every single time she tried something with a guy, i let her know how deeply it hurt me but like i said we were broken up and she didn’t give a shit. But i found something out

The two guys my girl did a lot of shit with are in our social circles and she made me go to small events that they would both be at. Her roommate even invented the guy my gf fucked to a party at her house. My gf went even though i told her how deeply it hurt me to see her around him and talking to him. She even let the guy she fucked chill in her bedroom -_-

Okay so after my gf and i got back together i asked her to completely block and cut contact with anyone she’s ever fucked and shit. She promised me she would and she never lied to me before. Well i just found out she kept contact with both of them and stayed extremely friendly with them even going as far as to send the guy she fucked drunk snaps and heart emojis while we were back together. She didn’t care about those guys but she didn’t wanna look like a freak for cutting contact she said. So she lied to me about this for literally 2 years and oh god it just hurts.

I love my girlfriend more than anything and i want to marry her BUT idk what to do. Literally every other day all i can think of is my gf hooking up with other guys, licking their dicks for them, letting them stick their tongue in her pussy, it all just fucking hurts so bad because that stuff was special between me and her and now it doesn’t feel special anymore at all (I’ve only fucked her and i was her first fuck before we broke up so us being each other’s first and only meant a really lot to me and she knew it) i keep picturing her wrapping her younger around the other guys tongue for hour and hours. Idk ugh.

Please help me. What do i do? I love her, i talk to her all about this stuff, but idk how to make these feeling stop. It’s tearing me apart inside please someone give me any advice. I need it to stop :(

EDIT; She swears on her life there will never be another lie out of her mouth.


TL:DR; My girlfriend broke up with me, fucked other guys, we got back together and years later i can’t stop picturing it and thinking about it. Help please.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7d3b0v/girl_basically_raped_me/" target="_blank" class="title">Girl basically raped me.</a>
            <div class="content">I&#x27;m a shemale and my supposed friend who I hung out with knew about it. The thing is she was always flirty so I assumed she was bisexual. I did enjoy it, being able to act like that with someone felt good but she was really using me just to try and... well...

She kept begging me to go clubbing with her and I finally agreed, while there, guys that would approach me would be pushed away by her claiming I&#x27;m her date tonight. I didn&#x27;t really care much and we basically got wasted. So since I was pretty bad, she had our friend take us to her house and I stayed the night there. So when I wake up I&#x27;m tied up to a pole in her closet for clothes/hangars. It&#x27;s actually pretty high so I was on my tippy toes. 

She came over happy as can be and I couldn&#x27;t say anything because she had tape over my mouth but she acted as though I actually asked for this. She started stripping me till I was in my panties, then when she pulls out my dick she says I&#x27;m so huge... then when she pulled my panties off said I smelled down there. And as if she was being sexy when she peels my skin back she says, I&#x27;ll clean it for you. 

And she gave me my first blowjob. Midway I even started whimpering like a dog because I was enjoying it. Then when she finished I was literally like a corpse because I felt so weak after all the cum that came out... more than I ever seen in my life. After that she didn&#x27;t instantly let me go, but she did when she wanted to know if I wanted to fuck her. I left of course and I haven&#x27;t answered any of her calls or text since.

This was supposed to be my friend but tbh, I feel like I was raped. Despite if I was in the moment or gave the wrong signs I&#x27;m really upset. What exactly should I do though? My sister thinks I should just tell the girl what she did was wrong, that it hurt me, and we can&#x27;t be friends. But I&#x27;m shaken on what I should do exactly... honestly I don&#x27;t have many friends so I&#x27;d maybe forgive her eventually.

Help?</div>

            <div class="content">So this is my first ever reddit post, i’ve seen a lot how the community can help people with problems. So I (24m) am in a happy long distance relationship with (23f). She’s across the country and we do a good job of communicating and seeing each other once a month. Before we became official I was talking to several women, once we became official, I’ve told those women explicitly that I am no longer interested and have a gf now. Most respected it and we put boundaries on our friendship. One of those women (22 f) who I should’ve completely cut off openly stated she respected the boundaries but her actions did not support this. I knew this and stopped talking to her for months, after she convinced me she had changed I let her back in my life with boundaries. We typically never seen each other alone, and always kept it cordial. One night I threw a party at my house and invited several people over including her. I had a lot to drink and she did as well. I usually am very good with my liquor but tonight with me being at home I felt safe, something was off though because I was very inebriated to the point where I could not do much for myself. i’ve never felt that way before and I knew this was not good for me so i went in my room and went to sleep. She later came in the room while I was sleep and i woke up to her trying to give me oral sex, I told her no and forcefully pushed her off of me, told her to leave and i went back to sleep. I later woke up to her being on top of me, by this point all of my clothes are off and sad to say my little friend has a mind of his own. for context, yes I am attracted to this girl but I did not want this and repeatedly refused her advances. thankfully I had enough strength to stop it, as I try to go to sleep I do not remember much after that but waking up a little less drunk later on in the night with us both being naked in the bed. as a guy it’s hard to even consider this happening to you, but i had nothing else to believe. i’ve repeatedly told her no and for her to go against my request and proceed, i felt inferior. Something that I would never wish on anyone, part of me blames myself for even putting myself in the situation or how my penis could even get up in that situation. I don’t remember every detail of that part of the night but i think I came in her just based on stains in the bed. waking up and realizing what might have happened I demanded she leave which she did, after that I tried to brush is off but it still haunts me. she apologized and credited it to being drunk, but that meant nothing to me. i’m afraid to tell anyone because how can i as a man let this happen to me, why am i dumb enough to even have this person in my life. Realizing the worst possible outcome of what could’ve happened, i urged her to get a morning after pill, hoping that it would tie any loose ends that could’ve resulted from the night, but me unsure if i even finished, just thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask her to get one. thinking that my nightmare was over I quickly blocked her and hoped never to hear from her again. I never brought the incident up with my girlfriend as it would create a huge rift in our relationship. fast forward 3 weeks later she texts me that she’s pregnant and will keep the child and that there is no way she will not. what do I do? how can this happen. what rights as a man do I have for this? is this even illegal?</div>

            <div class="content">I have a couple of situations that have happened to me that make me wonder if I was assaulted. Or maybe I was just violated?

1. One of my ex’s used to make me feel bad about wanting to use condoms. He would tell me we didn’t need them. He would say “you are on birth control right?” And when I would say yes he said “then we don’t need condoms”. One time I brought some over and he threw the box across his room and was upset saying how I needed to stop bringing more over because now he had boxes of them. We still had sex. I feel like I caved in to not deal with his whole speal on how we don’t need condoms. 

2. I was coming home one day and sitting at a stoplight. A guy motioned to roll down my window. He was kind of cute. I rolled down my window and he was saying how he thought I was so cute and how he wanted my number or Snapchat because he wanted to take me out on a date. He mentioned how the light was going to change soon so I should pull over to give him my number. I was excited as I was in a low point of my life. I pulled over. He got my snapchat and claimed that he was originally from a different country and how when you asked someone out you kissed them. I agreed to being kissed. Then he asked to make out. I was like um I don’t know about that. But he was insistent that you only live once. So I agreed. He goes into my car (I know this was a dumb thing to do). He tries to tell me that in his country you could just ask for sex from a woman on the streets and have sex. He tried to get me to have sex with him. I say no. He goes on saying how it’s been so long and so long since he was sucked off and so long since he was jerked off. He tries to get me to give him oral I keep saying no. He won’t leave my car. And his dick is pulled out. I panic and think the only way out is to jerk him off. He says how i should at least jerk him off and since I think that is the only way to get him out of my car I do. I felt disgusting. He finally got out of my car afterwards. 

3. I marched with someone i used to go to school with on tinder. He mentions how he always thought I was cute but didn’t do anything because of my ex. He asks me out and I think why not. He picks me up. We end up going to two different bars. He kept giving me drinks. It was a mixed drink of fruit punch or cherry with alcohol. I had about 4-5 drinks and since I am lightweight I was pretty drunk. He had a couple of drinks maybe like 2 maybe 3. He eventually takes me home. Im still drunk and I ask him if he’s ok to drive and he insists yeah. I don’t think anything of it. He takes me home and then follows me into the house. I show him my room. He then starts to make advances on me and I’m just giggly. I am not 100% sure how it happened but next thing I know we are having sex. Luckily I have condoms in my night stand so I say that a conform needs to be used which one was used. Afterwards he ends up staying the night. He then left for work in the morning. I say goodbye and then he ghosts me.

4. I went with a friend (who I don’t talk to since this incident because it made me feel awful) to his friend’s house for a mini party. Drinking and games. I get sleepy and fall asleep on the couch in my fuzzy pajama pants and tshirt. I then wake up to my drunk friend groping my leg. I was half asleep and still drunk and confused what was going on I just knew I didn’t like it and told him to stop. He kept groping my leg up and down and then proceeded to get to my vagina. He tried to finger me. He said how we should go into a guest bedroom where there was more privacy. I say no I was comfy on the couch and to stop. I push his hand away multiple times. He passed out on the couch next to me and I pass out. I wake up the next day not knowing if it was real or a dream as I dreamt about what happened with some added things (like his girlfriend yelling at me). I drove so I take him home and he tells me how he totally would have f-ed me if I was more cooperative. 

We’re any of this situations actually sexual assault? Or am I just overreacting?</div>

            <div class="content">
I’ve debating posting this, out of fear and embarrassment, but I really don’t know what else to do. I don’t know who to tell, I don’t know how to feel, (other than what I read is normal; sickness, sadness, and on the verge of a stroke) but I do think I need to get this out. And I welcome any advice, but please, if you’re taking the time to read my story- be kind. I’m very fragile right now.

I have 4 sisters. One of them, the oldest, passed away tragically 4 weeks ago today, at 35 years old. However- this post is not about her, but rather a preface to the already tremendous grief I’m dealing with on top of digesting what happened last night. 

This post is about the husband of my younger sister. She is 24. She’s been with her husband for 8 years. They had a shotgun wedding at 18 years old and never looked back. They share 2 children, a mortgage, and are really kind of the pinnacle of our family. Even though she’s younger she’s always kept us together. She’s the cook, the planner, the one who seemingly has all her shit together, the host, the one who will plan your birthday party 8 months in advance- but I digress...

10 years ago my mom made the decision to move across the country. She took said sister (well all of them actually) with her. I was 19 and pregnant at the time, so I stayed where I was on the East Coast, and just raised my daughter there, seldomly seeing my family. I started visiting here (home now) more frequently after the death of my grandparents, and I would sob every time I left. I never wanted to leave. I loved being near my sisters, my aunt and uncle, my niece and nephew, and my brother in law. Leaving was always a punch in the gut. So after 10 years, I finally convinced myself  to make a move to be with them, in Texas. Packed up my dogs, my 9 year old, and my boyfriend and moved out here. 

I’ve been here for 3 months. I’m at her house everyday. I got a place 8 miles from her. Our kids play, we share coffee in the mornings, sometimes we sneak off for an occasional margarita when they’re in bed and our partners are gaming. Anyways, we’re close. So close. Best friends- all of us. One big happy family.

Then after the sudden death of my sister, we became somehow even closer. My brother in law had helpful things to say sometimes, and he helped my sister grieve. He helped pick up some slack. My other younger sister and I have been inseparable. We cry to each other and try to still get through our bachelor Tuesday without bursting into tears. We had to plan funerals (yes two) and have just had each other to lean on with this. It’s been awful, but it was so nice knowing we had each other. All of us. 

Now, this would be my first Holiday season with my family in 10 years. I usually spent them crying in a closet at night back in Tennessee because I missed my family, and was around my boyfriends toxic parents only, but that’s another story. And although this would be our first Christmas without my oldest, and most wonderful sister, it would also be my daughters first Christmas with my family. Ever. Again, she is 9.

So now, into to the incident. 

My brother in law had a brain injury from a football accident in high school. He is doing fine now, and functions well. However, as it’s been explained to me, sometimes he has no filter. Literally says the most insane things sometimes that are either weird, out of line, sometimes funny when he speaks so freely with the excuse of not being able to help it- but it has been problematic at times. We all just try to laugh it off or tell him “not now” or apologize for his unapologetic commentary to those who don’t know. 

In the past few months he’s said some things that are flirty to me. Nothing major. Nothing that I would think anything of my own partner saying to my sister. Like “you’re a pretty girl, of course you’ll get that job” or compliment me in a ton of different ways. But he also recently starting saying some other things. One day he told me he wanted to kiss me. He was kind of drunk, and I just shook my head at him and thought “well, there it is- that brain injury coming out.”...

I dismissed it. I dismiss a lot with him, but I thought this one thing was weird and I did not appreciate it. It was said more than once after that. Or he would say my name in a weird way, I can’t explain it. Sometimes just talk about over sexual stuff. I always greeted it with “stop, x”. And I didn’t want to tell my sister because they’re already having some little marital issues and are in counseling. He comments on her weight sometimes, or hides money, etc. Not the best but not the worst. I figured that adding to it would just hurt her a lot, and dismissed it.

So, last night, after my sister and I had a socially distanced girls dinner (while our guys manned the children and made s’mores by a fire- just peachy)- we got home around 2 a.m. To their house. We decided to stay the night and not wake my daughter. They have a roomy house. This is something we’ve done several times, without any issues. 

My sister went to bed first. Then, my boyfriend (arguably my brother in laws best friend, btw), and it was just me and him. Outside. By a fire. Talking about my passed sister, talking about life, having a normal conversation that got deep at times about his mom being ill, but I didn’t feel any creepiness. No word vomit was happening, no kissing talk. Just two (basically) siblings by a fire as the last ones standing in a late evening.

He appeared drunk, but I have no idea how much he actually had. He’s not a slurring, knocked down kind of drunk. Just gets chatty and a little stumbly. Anyways, I had also had a couple drinks earlier in the night, and decided before bed I wanted to eat a bagel. With cream cheese. So I walked inside as he put out the fire.

He walked in after my moments later and turned off the oven where I was making the bagel. I looked at him, and said “hey, I’m making a bagel leave it on” and turned in back on. Then he turned it off again. And I turned it on. Didn’t know what was up with that. Then, he just kind of grabbed me towards him and said “you don’t need a bagel, come sit on the couch with me” I declined. He then turned off the oven again, grabbed both of my hands and said “Please, come to the couch with me? Let’s just talk a little longer”. I didn’t want to. I wanted to eat a damn bagel and go to bed. It was so late, and I was done talking. 

But then- he pulled me close to him and said “come on- it would be fun”

I asked what would be fun? I said that it was messed up if he was implying what I thought, and that my sister would be so horrified to know he had made that comment at all. I said “go to bed and sleep next to your wife.”

He then pulled me into the hallway. He is a welder by trade and pretty strong, but this was a forceful pull. 

Not knowing what to do, and not wanting to just scream “hey sis wake up, your husband is being a weird pervert to me”, I literally ran away from him and into my sisters bedroom. I laid down next to her. I knew if I was near her he wouldn’t keep saying these things or trying to touch me. 

She woke up, barely, and said what are you doing?? I didn’t have an answer. Her husband followed me into the room and laid on the other side of her. She asked him if he would go lay down on the couch, as my little family was already in the guest room. I think she thought I just wanted to sleep beside her, due to being sad about my sister.

He didn’t move. He laid there with her- as she fell asleep- with me on the other side of her. I gave it a couple minutes. Played dead. Then, when I thought he was asleep or at least not going to follow me out, I briskly walked out of the room and started to go down the hall to go up the stairs, and go to sleep myself. Next to my daughter and boyfriend. 

He all but chased me out of the room, and shut my sisters door. He pulled out his Penis, and grabbed my hand and placed it on it. I was fucking horrified. I must have said stop, no, etc, 15 times while he held my hand there for a few seconds. So disturbing.

While I managed to pull my hand away, and was making toward the stairs, but grabbed me as I was trying to go up. He was physically holding onto me as I tried to pull my way up the rails. 

I finally made it to the top, where there is a guest bathroom. I was wearing a skirt. He forced me into the bathroom and I said stop. Please. Stop. Quietly. Praying my boyfriend would walk out. Just not our kids. As he was trying to wrangle his dick out once more. 

Then, a glass fell off the counter. Made a huge crash, and it stopped him. I played it off like he needed to go take care of that quickly before the kids got up and stepped in any bits that got into the hallway. He agreed and headed downstairs to get a broom. 

I took my opportunity. I. Fucking. Flew. Into the bedroom where my boyfriend was. I shook him awake and said “(brother in law)” is trying to rape me into his ear, so my daughter wouldn’t hear. He hopped out of bed and said “what are you talking about??” 

He stepped out of the bedroom and there he was, sweeping up glass. Boyfriend said “what the fuck is going on?” And I said “ask him”. Brother in law said “I was sleeping and this glass broke.”

I then turned to my kids dad and mouthed to him “please just observe. Please pretend you’re going to bed. Please watch what he’s trying to do”.

I wanted a witness. I have seen this film before, and I knew that when I did eventually tell my sister the next day, I wanted a eye witness. However, boyfriend did not wait. He said that I was accusing him of rape. Brother in law looked bewildered. “What are you TALKING about” he said. “I’ve been asleep with *blank*.”

I said be honest. I was so sad. Felt betrayed and disgusted. I knew he would deny it, of course, but then - my sister wakes up. 

We had made it to the bottom of the stairs by her room and she heard us talking about it. When she asked what was going on, I looked to her husband. He was staring holes in me. He even mouthed “please”, in what I assume meant “don’t tell her.”

But I did. My boyfriend did too. She said “No way, that’s not real.”

I starting crying. I said “Why would I make this up? Why would I shake my boyfriend out of a slumber hysterically. Why do you think I came and laid beside you? Thank god the glass broke, was almost even worse.”

Thank. God. The. Glass. Broke. 

She then walked away to check on her kids while the rest of us stood there, BUT, as she walked back, she caught the tail end of my Brother in Law say 

“Please don’t tell. It will destroy my life” I knew she heard it. 

My daughter then came down the steps sleepy eyed. We acted like nothing was wrong, got my daughters things, and came home. I was anticipating a call from my sister with questions, but got none. Unusual, but I figured they were in the middle of it. 

Then I finally called her. She told me that her husband, who was first denying it all, then told her it happened, but was consensual. Obviously I was outraged. I kept my cool and asked her again, to be logical. Why would I have ran away. Why would I have tried to lay next to her to “protect” me. I even swore on our family, something I believe we all take very seriously at this time. I said he was lying and begged her to remember what she had heard him say. “Don’t tell.”

I imagine it would be bad enough if it was consensual- but to have to come to terms with the fact that your husband is an attempted rapist, to your big sister, is reasonably something you would like to be in denial about. I gave her some time.

Then we got a phone call (my boyfriend and I) Who feels so betrayed by the way. Anyways, on the phone was my brother in law on speakerphone, and he went on about how sorry he was and how much he loved us and our family was his world. He even said, I was out of my mind, I fucked up, I’m not even attracted to you. Ok. Weird but ok. He also said he was done drinking forever. 

Silence from my boyfriend. 
I said I hope we can get past this but I don’t know if we ever can. 


A few minutes later, my sister called back. Just saying she didn’t know what to do.
My youngest sister (yes I know a lot of sisters to keep up with) is up north out of town comforting my mom during this time. I am dog sitting. I asked if she wanted to ride with me. She said yes. I picked her up. 

When she got into the car, I said “how are you?” To which she replied “to be expected.”

I felt that. We mostly rode in silence to her house, with the occasional comment that this was all real fucked up. Even had a laugh or two on how this felt like a bad simulation and wasn’t real.

We took care of the dogs, and went to grab a bite. My sister, who sometimes has a drink with dinner, was taking shots. At a wing restaurant. A lot of shots. The waitress seemed a little concerned, my sister then started crying and told her what happened. The young and very nice girl said that my sis was a bad bitch, to wipe those tears, and that that was a really shitty thing for her husband to do. And with her sister.

She did not know I was the sister. Watching my sister get wrecked, and cry which she literally NEVER does. Not even at the funeral, was hard. I was trying to get us out of there. She just kept drinking. Saying she wanted a divorce, but she felt stuck. Apologizing to me for what happened. Going back and forth between laughing about what a piece of shut her husband was and crying about how this probably wasn&#x27;t the first time he had done this to someone. 

I finally got her out of there. She was drunk, she was unraveling. She was smoking cigarettes (she doesn’t do that) and just repeating she was not okay. I drove her home. She begged me to take her back to my house but I said just go inside- try to work it out- or get some sleep. If you need me, call me. 

Well she sure called me. She called me and asked me to come get her, and as I was getting redressed to do so, she said never mind. She said she was confused. She said her husband was once again saying it was consensual. That he swore I wanted it. Here we went again. I tried to tell her that was not the case but knew I was talking to a version of her that was so intoxicated it didn’t matter. I realize how hard it must be to accept your husband would do some creepy, betraying shit like that. 

She told me he said my skirt was so short, and that it kept riding up and I didn’t notice. He said he couldn’t help himself. It was the way I was dressed. THEN, just as I was telling my sister I could never look at his face again, he was getting a call that his mom was having a stroke. What the hell. So, he left her alone in the house. With her kids. Wasted and puking in her bathtub, crying to me and just saying she didn’t know what to think. I finally talked her out of the bathroom, and into her bed via phone. 

She then called me and said that my dead sister had just spoken to her in a dream and said that she was not okay with any of this ( older sister didn’t care for brother in law)


This brings me to right now.

She’s sleeping. My partner is being supportive but feels incredibly sad and betrayed himself. What the hell do we do on thanksgiving? What will I tell my daughter when we’re not at aunties every weekend? How do I move past this. Can I? Should I? 

I’m so sad. And I’m mostly sad for my sister.
She asked me not to tell my other siblings or my mother. I agree that would only bring my hurt on my hurting family, but I also feel people need to know. 

I don’t know what there is to do or say, and typically I am forgiving to a fault, but it all hit me when I got home that this wasn’t just a fluke dumb comment. I was sexually assaulted and almost raped. By my trusted brother in law.

I’m so sick, and sad. 
And I know I’m not the only one.</div>

            <div class="content">(Tl;dr at the end) I created a throwaway for this post because I’ve come to respect and realize that my time for privacy on this issue is now. (I also had a realization that I’m not even sure what I can talk about, since this is about to be an open investigation. I feel like it’s all anonymous enough to talk about.) I do want to talk about it, but I also value my own boundaries and know that I may not necessarily need people digging through my history and being inappropriate. I struggle with this sub because anything I’ve posted from my main handle has been... susceptible to abusive commenters. I have followed this sub since I came to reddit and I do admire and love the support you can find here, if you can miss the trolls that come out. Ok, now on to the story. And while it is triggering, this shiz has a happy ending. 

So just a bit of background- as is rampant on my regular handle, I was raped 10 whole years ago while in service. Now, as traumatizing as that was, I have worked and worked and worked to overcome the obstacles that it created in my life. I was discharged because of the rape and even spent 6 years blissfully unaware of the ptsd time bomb I was incubating. So to paint the picture here, I have just turned 30 presently, have spent the last 4 years putting my head back together. My life is in financial ruins because I was hospitalized 8 times in the last four years- complete with crazy person breakdowns. I just recently got a full time job to try and piece everything back together. Just moved into a new place and have had stable living for the last two months when I’ve been couch surfing all year. Basically it seemed like my life was finally turning around from the ruin I had experienced. 

For my 30th birthday I spent it with the two closest friends that have come into my life since I’ve had to rebuild. These two have been lucky enough to watch me rise and I love them both dearly. One is a girl and one is a guy. S will be the man and L will be the female. S was originally going to DD for us, but we still wanted to try to find someone else. While at birthday dinner with my mom, I received a text from L that a coworker of hers had volunteered to by DD because they had just moved to town and couldn’t drink but wanted to go out. I thought cool, someone being nice. 

We are going to skip the pleasantries and just go right into it. This dude was weird but not until we started hitting the bars. He was obnoxious in the way that his phone kept blowing up and he kept getting annoyed, rolling his eyes and saying very loudly “man, this chick just won’t get off my dick.”........ ok? Loser. We all ignored him when he did stuff like that. He stopped when we didn’t react the way he wanted. The end of the night comes around and I unfortunately live about an hour and a half from where I live. I’m still not quite sure how it went down, but dude who doesn’t get a letter designation wound up driving me home. 

I remember telling him about the couch that was a pullout bed. I remember offering to sleep in my roommates bed. Anything but my fucking bed, I’d made the decision from the moment I’d met him that he’d never get to touch me- I was an 11 in this dudes world and he was a 2. His teeth.... I can’t believe his mouth was anywhere near mine.... I digress.

This is what I remember about the actual rape. I’m sleeping on an air mattress currently, one I keep a little below full blown because it hurts my back too much. So naturally two people wouldn’t find comfort on my bed unless they were spooning intimately. Between the black out fuzzy spots, I’m not entirely sure how this weasel managed it, but he was as in MY bed. As I was getting comfortable, gathering my pillows to me and all around drunkenly nesting, I hear “stop moving your ass, I’ve warned you before now I’m warning you again, stop it or I’m going to fuck you because you’re asking for it.” 


...... drunk me, laughing “what?!” Because I simply can’t believe the shit I’m hearing. I turned over slightly as I said this, my entire body moving with the gesture. 

“That’s it, you’re begging for it.” And he threw me across my bed as violently as he could. I blacked out, my brain said peace, fuck this memory. 

I woke up the next day with nothing but a flimsy shirt on. He was standing over my bed fully clothed as if he had come into my room from another room to wake me up. I carried on about my morning and we stopped at the gas station so he could take me back to my car, the whole hour and a half drive of glory. It is at the gas station that he ask me, “do you remember what happened last night?” To which I regaled the glorious story of the pool princess who slung balls into pockets with grace and told creepers to fuck off. Because that was genuinely what I remembered. Up until he goes, “we had sex. It’s your fault I fucked you”.  

“It’s my fault... you... fucked... me?” I said the sentence with as much incredulity as I felt. He got the hint. He took me to my car and left for work. 

Now... because this isn’t my first rodeo I knew I had to act. But did I want to? Reporting in the military literally ruined my fucking life. No, it’s not worth reporting- I’ll just stay in bed until I have to work. And then I had to work. The time came for the mask to be put into place and I simply couldn’t handle the burden of it. I broke down, text my boss, and went to the hospital for a rape kit.

As a quick aside, this is the moment, this is the crossroads I looked down and is ultimately why I’ve come here to want to share my story. I almost missed my window- because I almost let the past haunt me so thoroughly that I didn’t report now. I’m very lucky because I live in a border town, and the state I live in carries harsher punishment than the state I work and party in. The crime happened at my home so it happened in the state who prosecutes these crimes with impunity. 

When I got to the hospital, i almost had to relocate because there were no trauma nurses on call. I have to admit, I was terrified of getting the rape kit done anywhere else, I trust my new state far more than my old one and I didn’t want my old states hands in this case. Not only was a police officer taking my statement within the hour, representation from the DA’s office also showed up. I was given a run down on the turn around time for when they expected to have this guy cuffed and tried. (The cop was almost ecstatic when he found out dude is already on felony probation, in fact he chuckled and told me he’d have him by the end of the week, at least as soon as the report was back from labs.) 

No one left any room for letting him get away with it.

No one accused me of drinking too much, what was I wearing? Why was I around someone I didn’t know? 

No one tried telling me it was my fault. 

No one victim shamed me.

I’ve never had that before... I’ve gone through the entirety of my 20’s under the invisible shame everyone in the military had left me with after my report back then. 

I have had nothing but an outpouring of love and support from those around me. Not that I wanted a re-traumatizing event... but I can’t help but smile at the irony... at the little kindness that THIS time, I’m not alone and little and lost- that this man will never rape another woman again because I’ve been able to be strong enough to bring him to justice. I was lucky because I was not aware that rape kits are soooo time sensitive. Yes, of course I was aware, but just how little time you have.... is what I was very ignorant on. Luckily I went in with evidence still to collect. 

I’ll never discourage someone from getting a rape kit done. I also will never lie to you that that shit was traumatizing in and of itself. Being recorded while you tell the story of getting raped. Getting bruises measured and photographed. Getting antibiotics and meds for anything under the goddamn sun that make you sick to your stomach. Getting a shot in the ass that makes those steroid shots in the ass look like child’s play. Having to answer questions about consensual sex that occurred around the time of the rape. Having to give names of consensual partners and then having to tell them just in case they get a subpoena (and you’d always rather they heard that shit from you and not the DA). 

It’s not a glorious process and I’ve already watched someone I was seeing slip silently out of my life (we had a disagreement and he was pissed af when he thought I might not report). But has it been empowering? Yes. Would I do it again? Abso-fucking-lutely. 

I’ve already made appointments concerning counseling and conducting self care. When I had to tell my boss what I was doing.... she acted like being at her store since 5am and having to close at 10pm was worse than being at the hospital getting a rape kit.... So I might be looking for new employment as well. But I am extremely proud of myself, I made the right choice, even though it wasn’t the easy choice. I overcame a huge wall in my own psyche to even walk into the hospital. So... I want to send a message of love and support to anyone else who might need a dose of courage. Honestly, I walked into that hospital yesterday for any woman who would come after me. And for any woman who came before me. I still have a long road, if there is any interest I can of course post the outcome once it comes to pass. For now- thank you for reading if you took on that endeavor. Have a very beautiful holiday!

Tl;dr I was raped on my 30th birthday by my DD. I have been raped before and reporting didn’t do anything the first time. Overcame those mental traumas and went to the hospital for rape kit. Reported that MF. While the kit was a rough experience, it was empowering. Now we wait for the justice porn brigade, cuz they on they way 😏

            <div class="content">A few months ago my friend and coworker tried to get me to have sex with him. We’re both in pretty committed relationships and I’ve never really seen him like that so I said no. Especially since he was dating one of my friends.

He kept asking over and over and said he’d been thinking of having sex with me for months and he kept trying to pull out his penis even though I kept telling him I wasn’t having sex with him. He said that if we just had sex one time he would get it out of his system and not bother me again but I said no. He got upset and embarrassed and said that he was an asshole and that now things would be weird between us. I reassured him it was fine and that we could just forget about it and leave it at that. 

I went home to my boyfriend and told him what happened. He was understandably pissed but we have a healthy relationship built on trust and knew I was telling the truth when I said nothing happened. He’s hated my coworker ever since but we’ve left it at that and everything went back to normal. I still hung out with my coworker, never alone, and he never hit on me again. He would at times talk about how frustrated he was with his relationship and he told a few of us from the office that he couldn’t see himself spending the rest of his life with his girlfriend. We all chalked it up to him being who he was and didn’t say anything other than letting him know that maybe he should reassess his relationship. He would shrug us off and we let it go. 

Two weeks ago one of my other friends bragged to me that she slept with him at a party the night before with his girlfriend, our mutual friend, in another part of the house. She does things like this all the time and acts like there’s no problem with it. She genuinely takes pride in being the “other woman”. She’s never done it to one of our friends and we’ve always just told her we thought what she was doing was wrong but it never went any further until this time.
I got pretty upset after she told me. Why the hell would she drag me into the middle of this? Did she expect me to “pick” her over our other friend and not say anything? I wasn’t sure if it was even my place to say anything but if I was in my other friend’s position I would have wanted to know. 

I went home and talked to my boyfriend. He said that she deserved to know and that as a friend I should tell her. He confessed that he was tempted to contact her via Facebook after what her boyfriend, my coworker, tried to do those few months ago but decided not to because he was worried I would be pissed.
So I told my other friend because I thought she deserved to know and the guilt of keeping it to myself was killing me. She didn’t know who to believe since he was denying it. She kept asking me who she should believe and felt so shitty that I confessed that a few months back he tried to get me to have sex with him and I could see him cheating on her.

I didn’t tell her the details. I just said he was very drunk and asked me to have sex with him and I said no and it ended there. She was extremely upset and couldn’t understand why I never told her when it happened. I didn’t have an answer because really, I just didn’t want to be involved because I felt uncomfortable and I selfishly wanted to keep my friendships intact.

I didn’t tell her how he always talks about not seeing them spend their lives together and how he always tries to pick up other women even though she tells everyone that they’re going to get married one day and have kids together.

He confessed to trying to sleep with me but still denied sleeping with the other girl. She lost her mind and broke up with him after telling him that I was the one who told her. So now I’m going to work every day dreading seeing him. He was on a business trip when this all went down and afterward extended the duration of his trip. Everyone in the office is confused why he would do that since he hates where he’s at but I couldn’t help but be relieved when I heard he wouldn’t be back for a week or so especially since his cubicle is right next to mine and our work requires us to be in constant contact with each other when he’s in the office. I’m dreading seeing him and I feel like shit for even saying anything in the first place. Or at least telling her about how he tried to get me to have sex with him.

I want to call him and talk to him but I’m too scared. If I had kept my mouth shut I would still have three friends, pretty much the only friends I actively hang out with, but I would have known about how two of them were screwing over my other friend. Especially since I KNOW that they would have continued having sex behind her back. I still don’t know if I did the right thing and I just feel like shit.</div>

            <div class="content">**Thank you a lot for reading all of this and if u have some advice or anything that could help It would mean a lot**

She&#x27;ll be called &quot;A&quot; in text, I&#x27;ll be &quot;B&quot; . She&#x27;s 18, I&#x27;m 19 now.

&amp;nbsp;

A and B met through mutual friend in June 2014. They are living about 150 km = 93 miles apart. They quickly became pretty good friends. From July to September they were talking a lot on the phone. After September we basically spent 2+ hours every day talking on Skype and playing games together. At this point we were already really good friends and cared for each other. We couldn&#x27;t stop talking. We never run out of things to talk about. This continued for quite some time

&amp;nbsp;

November that year was first time we met. She came with her school to my city and she had some free time. It was quite awkward at first. Because we&#x27;ve never seen each other until now but it was obvious we were really both really glad to see each other finally. At December I came to her city on my own to spend a day with her and out mutual friend. It was just great and it was the first time we kissed. But like all of us kissed with everyone so like A kissed B and best friend , I kissed A and best friend and best friend kissed with A and B. So it was more friendshly even thou we both wanted it and were excited about it. At the end of the day she gave me her woolly hat and I&#x27;m sleep with it from that day till now. 

&amp;nbsp;

Soon after i started having some really strong fillings for her. I think we can say I feel in love. I couldn&#x27;t have stopped thinking about her. I haven&#x27;t told her that because she hasn&#x27;t shown any interest in me for something more than a friend and even if she would be willing to give it a chance, she wouldn&#x27;t because we weren&#x27;t able to see each other more than 1 every 2-3 months due to living far apart. This continued for like really long maybe 1,5 years. I didn&#x27;t have any girlfriends or anything... I just didn&#x27;t find them as interesting as her. She had like decent number of guys she kiss in club and 2 boyfriends but those relationship didn&#x27;t last for very long. Let&#x27;s just say whenever she kissed someone it hurt me but i never told her anything since like I&#x27;m her friend I don&#x27;t have the right to tell her anything like that... 

&amp;nbsp;

Well after that 1,5 years some problems came in our friendship. We didn&#x27;t really solved them and combined with 3/4 times we met in live sucked, she decided to end our friendship (it wasn&#x27;t this simple but this text is already long so... yea). Well at the end i decided to tell her i had/have fillings for her for really long time, not to keep her but more to like idk tell her because it was in me for so freaking long. After that we didn&#x27;t really talk too much but we talked about important things only and like yea... Even thou we kinda ended our friendship we cared for each other. And to my surprise even thou my infatuation weaken through all those years I really felt like shit, 0 worth and defeated every time she kissed someone or smth like that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Like this summer one other girl was like I can suck your dick if u want and I was like naah i don&#x27;t really want that. I mean she wasn&#x27;t too attractive but esspecialy if u&#x27;r a guy u&#x27;ll understand how much I&#x27;m fucked up to like decline a bj lol...

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways at the end of September 2017. I came to study at her city. ( I didn&#x27;t have good enough grades to go in university for that subject in my city ) . We met for coffee and after 15 minutes of weirdness we were like we didn&#x27;t have a 8 month break. She even canceled some plans with her friends that weekend and came to drink with me at my place. It was like awesome she slept at my place and we slept together ( not sex only sleep ). 

&amp;nbsp;

And it was like really all great until this weekend. We went out to a club with our best friend and few more people and ofc she found someone or actually he found her and I just couldn&#x27;t really watch that. I mean I was just drinking and drinking i cleaned everyone&#x27;s drinks what were on table few times. I just stared at her and tried to take her away from him or any other guy that came I just couldn&#x27;t look at her but i know i had no right to do that. I mean she &quot;send&quot; our best friend to keep me ocupied since I was just jerk... I totaly lost it and i don&#x27;t remember better part of that night. At the end we got to my place and i was totaly out of it. For fuck sake I was throwing up with my head in wc and started fucking talking like I was streaming. I was fucking crawling on floor in front of her... Yea... 

&amp;nbsp;

In the morning we talked about it and I was really sorry for what I&#x27;ve done because i can&#x27;t really control my self when I&#x27;m drunk but that&#x27;s like not only thing. Every time she&#x27;s with other guy i just felt so fucking bad... Like my soul is hurting me, I&#x27;m half crying, I&#x27;m total mess, I think can&#x27;t find my self half worth it. 

&amp;nbsp;

The day after I asked her if there was any chance that she&#x27;d gave us a chance. Even thou I knew chances were very close to 0 
I wanted to try because yea... And she took it pretty hard, ofc answer was no and she was a bit hurt that i asked her that i could feel. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just don&#x27;t know what to do... I don&#x27;t even think about us being together, I know it won&#x27;t happen, but I can&#x27;t do anything to stop the pain. I tried so fucking many things... But the pain is so fucking big, and i just can&#x27;t stop thinking about her and everything... I honestly want to be free of that love of whatever the fuck this is. I want to be happy for her when she has someone and to be able to actually have someone for myself. I&#x27;m just really sad about everything because I&#x27;m causing her pain and I&#x27;m in pain but there is really nothing I can remember to do. I&#x27;m honestly at the point to think about going to psychologist
with this, it is that bad i feel... and it&#x27;s like 3 years of this pain and shit it just so fucked up...

            <div class="content">Quick Reddit vent about my father-in-law. 
I (31F) and my husband (31m) have lived with my father-in-law who is currently 68 (let&#x27;s call him Dick) for 9 years. We didn&#x27;t need to do this, but when my mother-in-law (we will call her Jane)  passed away  from an infection exacerbated by diabetes in 2016 at the age of 64, we decided the best thing to do would be to move in with his elderly father to help with his bills and care. My husband is an only child so this is very much an expectation that has weighed on him since he was a kid. Dick took the loss of Jane very hard as they had been together for more than 40 years. For the first 3 years he wouldn&#x27;t even open a single piece of mail that had Janes name on it and we couldn&#x27;t even say her name around him with out it setting Dick off for the next few days. 

For years after Jane&#x27;s death he would scream her name in the middle of the night. He would have night terrors constantly involving her. Which would wake us up and we would need to check in on him. So many many sleepless nights. We asked him many times to go to grief counseling, but if you know that age group they don&#x27;t like to do those things. So we ended up getting him a dog as a companion, and for the first few years that seemed to help. It breathed a little life back into him.

Since 2020 Dick&#x27;s health has gone downhill. He never had Covid, so that isn&#x27;t a factor. He doesn&#x27;t take care of himself, has been a lifetime smoker, doesn&#x27;t eat healthy and goes to the bar VERY often (more on this later). From heart issues, strokes, blood pressure issues, his kidneys shutting down, blood infections, bad falls caused by intoxication and all of the other medical problems he has going on, he&#x27;s been hospitalized four times in the last 4 years. 

Okay, now that you guys have a little bit of the lore, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. 

I guess this all really started last year in August when Dick had a very bad fall from coming into the house intoxicated. It was bad enough that he bloodied his nose and got a gash on his leg  about the size of a quarter. Luckily my brother was visiting, so he was able to help me lift Dick off the floor. He is a very big man and if he hit the ground  with only me here I would definitely need to call the fire department. He is pre-diabetic as well so his body&#x27;s healing rate isn&#x27;t very good. Over the course of the following months we watched the wound on his leg get worse and worse. We commented on it often and told him that we would pay for the copay with his insurance for him to go to the doctor. To which he responded &quot;he didn&#x27;t think it was that bad&quot; 

He was wrong and in October he had a stroke. When Dick went to the hospital they told him it was brought on by all of the ibuprofen he was taking to help manage the pain of the gash on his leg. By this point his leg was literally purple and days away from being gangrene. His doctors told him that his alcoholism was causing his body to have a harder time fighting infections to healing and that he needed to give that up. 

After a few weeks in a rehabilitation center Dick was able to come home, and for the first few weeks it seemed as though he really was going to change. He did stop smoking cigarettes and hasn&#x27;t picked that habit back up to our knowledge,  and for awhile (3 weeks) he didn&#x27;t go to the bar. But that was short-lived. 

You see Dicks younger sister (55-ish F and we will call her Kathy) is also an alcoholic, and is constantly buying him drinks when they hang out at the bar. Kathy is honestly the definition of an enabler. Whenever he&#x27;s having medical issues she swoops in and acts like she&#x27;s the best sister in the whole world. But when he&#x27;s on the up an up she feeds him alcohol and doesn&#x27;t seem to understand why it&#x27;s an issue. So as soon as he was able to walk without his walker they were sitting at the bar. 

We had put up with this behavior for years but around Christmas in 2024 this all changed.

My husband&#x27;s family owns a bit of hunting land about 4 hours away from us with a small old family cabin that his great grandparents used to live in. It is literally in the middle of nowhere, the nearest hospital is 45 minutes away. Dick&#x27;s brother died of a heart attack on the front lawn waiting for an ambulance to arrive a few years ago.  

For Christmas Dick wanted us all to spend the holiday at the family hunting cabin. A few days before the trip my husband realized that his truck was having some transmission issues. He decided to take the truck apart and try to fix it (he&#x27;s normally very handy) He tried desperately every day until literally hours before we were supposed to leave and was unable to get her working.

I worked Christmas Eve so I was not home when all of this was going on. By the time I was getting off of work my husband and I had decided that we would not be taking the trip in the truck. We got back to the house and Dick had already loaded up his car with his bags. 

We told him that the truck wasn&#x27;t going to make it and that we wouldn&#x27;t be going. He insisted that we could all load up into his 4 seater car and drive the 4 hours to the hunting cabin. He even started to unload his oxygen machine so that we would have enough room for our legs. This would have been three adults and two dogs with all of our luggage and food for 3 Days loaded up in a small vehicle. And at that time Dick had a suspicion that one of his tires had a slow leak. 

Now my husband always tries to reason with his father, but no matter what my husband said Dick would not budge on wanting us all to load up in the car. After watching my husband struggle with him for about 10 minutes and him giving me this desperate look of &#x27;idk what to do&#x27; I piped up. My exact words were &quot;I guess someone needs to be the bad guy in this situation, and that&#x27;s going to be me today. I&#x27;m saying that we are not loading up in that car because it is unsafe. If you choose to load up into it that&#x27;s your own prerogative.&quot; As it would turn out after Christmas less than 50 mi on the tire later it blew and stranded him on the side of the road.

Boy Dick did not like that... He&#x27;s a good old southern man so the idea of a woman telling him anything is very much against his man code. He proceeded to slam all of his car doors and throw an absolute temper tantrum. Stormed back in the house and stayed in his room the rest of Christmas Eve. 

Christmas day was no better. He refused to touch any of the gifts that we had gotten him (I had bought him a new pillow and a small mini fridge for his room so he wouldn&#x27;t have to go so far for water). Insisting that we were doing it on purpose to embarrass him because he hadn&#x27;t bought us any gifts. To be fair he normally does not buy gifts for us,  so we were not expecting any from him. The two things I bought for him were to help him with his medical issues. So I didn&#x27;t really think of them as pointless Christmas gifts as he described... And as we proceeded to open our own gifts that we had gotten for each other, he made comments about our gifts. Saying things like &quot;oh that must have been expensive.&quot; To put it short he really ruined Christmas for all of us with his pity party nonsense.

Me being the one to make the decision that we were not going to be traveling for Christmas put a deep wedge between us. A few weeks later I was sitting in the bathroom of our home which shares a wall with Dicks bedroom and I could hear him speaking to Kathy on the phone. He said some very nasty things about me to his sister, which included but are not limited to:
&quot;She&#x27;s a Looney tune just like her mother, there&#x27;s something wrong with that whole family.&quot;
 &quot;If she ever did get pregnant it would be to trap my son with a kid&quot; And that
&quot;I&#x27;m a lazy gold digger&quot;

I work  just as much as my husband, get paid the same hourly wage and maybe work 5 hours less a week. By contrast Jane (MIL) never worked and was a stay home house wife. I have completely taken on the domestic roles within our home for years. Doing all of the dishes, all of the laundry, all of the shopping, all of the cleaning, and all of the general care. I&#x27;ve cleaned up after Dick every day over the years since he  cannot even pick up the most basic of trash behind himself. Not to mention the fact that we pay him $400 a month in rent, pay for his car insurance, pay for his phone bill, pay for the internet, and pay for the television. And still he comes to us asking for money to support him which we tend to give without much fuss.

I have literally gone into Dick&#x27;s room and completely cleaned it multiple times over the last 9 years. After his last rehabilitation stay we even scrubbed the walls down to get the nicotine stains out of his room from 40 years of smoking thinking that getting rid of the smell would help him quit. 

He is a hoarder who is completely content to sit in a pile of his own trash and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve gone in there and found piss in bottles. One time while cleaning, I realized that I was picking up HUMAN teeth off of the ground since as they rotted out of his head he was just pulling them with his fingers and dropping them on the ground next to his chair, and I had to clean that up. 

Needless to say with all that I&#x27;ve done for him, I was very upset to hear Dick speak about me like that. My father abandoned us when I was very very young so I never had a dad growing up. And despite all the hardship I had come to start to think of Dick as a father-ish figure. This wasn&#x27;t even the first time I&#x27;d heard him speak about me through the wall. He had said many other nasty things but this was just the last straw on the camel&#x27;s back. I called my husband in tears while he was at work. He immediately left work came home and yelled at his father. He defended me and stood his ground that what was happening wasn&#x27;t okay. 

That caused Dick to not speak to us for 2 weeks and made our home extremely uncomfortable to be in. A few weeks later he finally spoke to us but it wasn&#x27;t to say any sorrys. He acted as though the whole thing had never happened. So I honestly feel like I didn&#x27;t get closure in this situation. My husband has asked for me just to keep the peace because he says his father is too hard-headed to talk to or work things out with. 

2 weeks ago Dick started having issues again, his blood pressure was extremely low and his kidneys started to shut down again. We told him that we would get him to the hospital but he absolutely refused. It wasn&#x27;t until Kathy came to the house and called the ambulance that he was willing to go. (I think the reason he listens to her is because she pays for his drinks and supports his habits.) 

A few days after his admittance, Kathy came to the house to talk to us about what the doctors were saying. During the conversation my husband brought up to her that he felt that his dad really needed to slow down on his drinking. Kathy, who as mentioned is also an alcoholic, denied that there was any issue. Telling us that it was best to just let him do whatever he wanted to do because he was old. We told her that she doesn&#x27;t have to live with him and doesn&#x27;t have to pick him up off the floor when he&#x27;s drunk or deal with the ramblings and ravings of an out of mind man.

 I even had a video to show her from a month back when he was sitting at the island in the kitchen rocking back and forth drawing on the countertop with a pen because he was so drunk that he didn&#x27;t notice he wasn&#x27;t using paper and couldn&#x27;t stand up to get to his room. Kathy was the one that had dropped him off at the house that night. She also accused me of manipulating my husband into believing these things about his father. Which is absolutely not true, my husband doesn&#x27;t say or do anything that he doesn&#x27;t feel or want. He&#x27;s a very strong-willed man.

Now this is where I start to wonder if we are bad people... All the stress and pressure has definitely changed my husband&#x27;s personality over the last few years. He used to be much happier lighter and brighter but as of late he has gotten very depressed, solemn, and quiet. But literally the night that his father was put in the hospital it was like seeing my husband come back to life. It was the same way last year in October when Dick was put into the rehabilitation center. He&#x27;s smiling, laughing, and being more affectionate. I can physically see that my husband&#x27;s shoulders sit lower and more relaxed.

A few days in we were sitting together talking, and somehow got to the topic that &quot;It would be better if he just d*ed in the hospital&quot; because neither of us knew how much longer we could emotionally put ourselves through this. As soon as the words left our mouths we both got quiet and looked at each other to see how the other felt. And the look of potential relief on both of our faces unsettled us. 

My husband and I would love to start a family, we would love to be able to build our own home with our own things in it, and start living our lives. Rather than living in a house that&#x27;s a monument to a dead woman and a sad hoarder of a man. But as long as we&#x27;re expected to care for Dick I don&#x27;t think we ever will. In one of Dick&#x27;s drunken moments he told both of us that if we didn&#x27;t live here he would just kill himself. My husband is too faithful to his father to leave him to die in his chair in his room. 

My husband feels obligated to stay in the home and care for his father, since he was adopted as a baby. He has been raised that he is expected to sacrifice all for the family and I can see him fighting that instinct. Both of his parents got sick when he was 15 and at that time he became the primary financial supporter of his parents and has remained that way for 16 years.. and I can see that it&#x27;s hurting his relationship with his father.

Are we wrong for wishing that he would just pass already? So that way we could preserve some amount of love for him after he passes, because at this moment there isn&#x27;t very much of it for him between either of us. 

Are we bad people? Should we move out and leave Dick to his own vices? And if we don&#x27;t what can we do to preserve our sanity through what I can expect to be a very rough few last year&#x27;s of Dick&#x27;s life...

            <div class="content">in my apartment building, i live in the top middle apt. the people downstairs- a male and female- have caused some issues since i’ve moved in. 

one- she said she needed to speak to me privately- where she proceeded to drunkenly tell me how she knows i get good dick. why, you ask? because apparently her and my boyfriend have fucked. not only that- she has two boyfriends already. one being my boyfriends ex bff. crazy right???

two- she got subs. and i recently discovered i’m pregnant. im crazy ash. well i messaged her a couple days ago around 5 am because honestly, when i can clearly hear every word to pumped up kicks at 5 am, no matter who u are, i’m gonna see what’s up lmaoo. now usually i just leave it alone. but since she got the subs…

between her constantly fighting throughout the night with her boyfriend, the screaming, hitting, slamming doors… i had to text her. 

i’m copying an pasting here-

me- pls turn it down. its driving me crazy. its 5 am and James works at 7 am. 
——

she didn’t respond until 3:47 pm.

her- We never blasted anything last night we had headphones in but noted I&#x27;ll b more cautious

            <div class="content">My roommate invited people over for her birthday. One of them was a guy I’ve seen around but didn’t really know. We talked and laughed at the same stupid jokes. Then we start popping party pills...which no one planned on doing. The guy and I end up taking a walk to the store that night which consisted of me giving him a blowjob outside and us making out everywhere. We also talked and cuddled right by the stars so it was pretty damn romantic. At this point I feel a genuine connection that I haven’t felt since my last relationship. I wanna slow things down bc I’m crushing on him but also I’m hella turned on and so is he. Then he waits around until everyone leaves and we go to my room and make love. He ends up fucking me twice even tho drugs can make it hard to stay errect so obvs we got some chemistry or my double Ds keep him hard. At the end we cuddle and listen to music. I usually don’t cuddle during ONS but I really like this guy. He picks some sad music so I say it’s ok to be sad since we’re all sad sometimes. He saids nope, he’s really happy rn. He’s just simping. Of course I’m hoping he’s simping for me and not his ex from 7 months ago. I take him back to his car in the morning and he insists on filling up and paying for my gas tank. He tries to kiss me good bye but I got distracted and helped get something out of his hair. Then we hug and hug again outside of the car. He tells me to text when I get home safe but I say I don’t have his number but he has mine. So he saids he’ll text and that we should hang out again. 

Fast forward two days, I realize he hasn’t texted so I wonder if I gave him the wrong number when I was a bit high. So I get the number from my roommate and text him hi. He doesn’t seem that interested based on how he takes his time to reply. So I think he’s not interested in me as much as I am into him. My friends tell me he’s going thru some baggage and leftover feelings from his ex. 

I got stupid drunk last Friday and texted him “I miss ur dick” so he texts back saying he’s not looking for anything serious. So I apologize and say I got too drunk. I respect his space but lowkey I’d still like to be friends and be able to invite him to come hangout and drink with with our friends. Is this still possible for us? How would I approach it? I throw hangouts pretty often and I have one coming up this weekend. 

TLDR: I slept with a guy that I had a connection with but he’s not interested in anything else. But I wanna keep him as a friend since we share the same friends and he’s fun to drink with. How do I approach it?</div>

            <div class="content">First of all, my problems aren&#x27;t important. If there&#x27;s someone else who needs help, answer them first. I don’t even know what I have. I&#x27;m probably insane at this point. Just, any advice would be appreciated, I don’t know how much longer I can do this, cause all my methods are clearly not working. But if you’ve got more important things, don’t waste time on me. Second, this is long as hell, i&#x27;m sorry about that. There&#x27;s just a lot i needed to say and get off my chest. This also helps for context. I just don&#x27;t know what to do right now.

My earliest memories are from Pre K. There’s one major thing I remember, being happy. I had a best friend. Steve. He was awesome. Me and my perfectly average Pre K self got along like brothers separated at birth. Even as a little kid, I remember leaving the classroom each day and we would say stuff you&#x27;d say to your family, like, “Can’t wait to see you later.” or “I love you.” Not in a gay way of course, but in a, your my family way. I remember this particularly because my dad would yell at me for it, calling it unnatural and unacceptable.(I come from a very conservative christian family, and he was a super conservative. Don’t think modern day Trumptard, but more like Bush and Cheney but without the racism. Also, to add to that, my dad is also the greatest human being alive, despite some of his views. A hero if I’ve ever known one, so don’t you dare trash him.) Me and Steve even played little basketball together. It was great.

Then one day, not long after Steve’s sixth birthday party, My mom sat me down and explained that, God had a plan for everyone, and Steve’s just so happened to be one where he slipped and smashed his head on concrete, and the final part of the plan, is him never coming home from the hospital. It hit me hard. I developed what I assume to be a form of depression, even considering ways, at five, to join the only person I truly made a genuine connection to. As the next few years rolled by, I retracted. I don’t know why, but I could not become friends with anyone. At all. I developed anxiety after a short while, getting extremely worried over insignificant things. This got worse until about eight years old, where I tried telling my parents this. The response was a bit… not good. At first I was told it was normal, then that it was stupid. Then I was told my my dad that I was just, quite simply an entitled, prissy, son of a bitch who can’t stand anything going wrong. Again, don’t complain about him, I genuinely believe he thought this was whats best. So I shut up. I also had an experience where I woke up, and was totally frozen, unable to move. couldn’t do anything for thirty seconds. It happened once or twice, and I called it freezies.

Through eight till seventh grade, I kept my head down. Didn’t play sports didn’t make a bunch of friends. Only one or two who I genuinely was friends with. I avoided attention. I slowly fell sadder and sadder, eventually attempting and failing at suicide. The main thing stopping it was, of course, this girl. Her name was Breane. Looking back now, she was gorgeous. Long shiny black hair, beautiful smile, glasses that actually made her look cuter, so much more. I still wonder what became of her. I knew she liked me, and she knew I liked her, but neither of us had the courage. When I finally got a phone, wed stay up for hours talking. I even talked her out of suicide. Though it wasn’t all rainbows at this point. I had grown to develop some horribly bad anxiety. While my depressive feelings had gradually got worse, the anxiety and self loathing took off like a spaceship. I started to beat myself up over everything, self harm, bleach, you name it. Some weeks id break down every day. But honestly I’m thankful, I learned to be a great actor during this time. Anytime I acted odd, my parents immediately thought drugs, so I learned to cover my tear ridden trail pretty effectively. By the time seventh grade rolled around however I was no longer content. I wanted to be rid of these feelings. So, like any rational teen, I went crazy. 

I decided the way to get over my problems, was, to make them a hell of a lot worse. Actually terrible. I started acting out, and like a dick. This was right at the middle of the edgy, asshole part of school, and I decided to capitalize. I was a total dick wad to every and all teachers, actually took credit for one quitting. Id do the same thing to other kids too, except not nearly as extreme. This was during the whole, fuck the establishment mood the trump campaign had brought on, so some of my antics were indeed noticed by students up above me. And just happened to be luck, our principal was universally hated, staff and students, so anything against her was a bonus. I actually got a lot of superficial friends this way, and everyone knew my name. While the social situation, improved, from an outside perspective, my mental situation deteriorated to nothing. My anxiety was now giving me nightly breakdowns, and all I ever thought about was suicide, but my whole reputation was based on this secure level headed say it how it is kinda attitude, so Christ fucking forbid I say anything. Then Breane moved away. Soon the Adrenalin and Adderall, that I illegally obtained, and I soon became addicted to were the only thing getting me through the day. Not to mention, the freezies got a hell of a lot worse, lasting up to a minute, and, (I know this part sounds like bullshit, I don’t know if I even believe this) where id actually see things, like weird shadow looking people attempt to attack me, and id see animals and shit, and it was so vivid. I honestly don’t know if I was literally insane or what. I this ended up fucking my sleep schedule beyond reason, to the point I became, and still am, able to operate after being awake 56 hours straight. I can be up for days and it wont bother me. Beyond that, the Adderall got balanced out by my parents telling me about how I was a fuck up, and that they thought I was useless, not great for my psyche I don’t know why but most of the time I just cant sleep at all. Sleep or not, this cycle of Adderall and adrenalin to stave off the helplessness and sadness became my life until the end of eighth grade.

Fortune would have it, going into ninth grade, the kids above me knew a neutered form of what I was. They all knew my name, but they only knew me as the guy who fucked with the principal, and made their life hell. Thus, I was extremely well liked by the juniors who the principal treated like shit. And even better, I got pun in classes with mostly older kids. I dropped the edgy shit, and acted like a decent person for once, and slowly over ninth grade year, I got to know the entire eleventh grade class, two grades above me. Thanks to the anxiety, I was able to keep my mouth shut when I needed to and thanks to the not giving a fuck, I could make some decent jokes that got me into the inner circle of the entire junior class. I was generally well liked and known around. Meanwhile my mental situation kind of didn’t get worse, but it didn’t get better. The freezies and the weird hallucinations continued, and I was still able to ignore my anxiety for a while. I still couldn’t sleep, but this hardly bothered me by now. Id grown accustomed to days without rest. What little sustainability I had in my head got me through ninth grade, all while slowly, after realizing how much it cost me, getting off my Adderall addiction, which I still cant believe I did. And actually, tenth grade would only be better.

I got super lucky tenth grade as well. I got a lunch period with all the most popular and liked juniors, now seniors. Unbelievably, they invited me over to their table, first day, this kid two years younger. Over the course of the year I became close friends with most of the now seniors, and actually, finally, had a bunch of genuine connections with about ten of them. I slowly got a bit less depressed, and actually was happy with some of these people for the first time in my life. While genuine happiness was great, it was balanced out with guilt. Of all the shit id done to people. All the fucked up stuff. I tried to distract from it by going out with a bunch of different girls, most of whom I didn’t like, but that didn’t help much. Speaking of, there was one girl I absolutely adored. Head to toe stunning and an amazing personality. A senior, like most of my friends, she, unbelievably, asked me out. Twice. And I said no. I never told her this, but I said no because of myself. I genuinely liked her, and there was absolutely no way in hell I was gonna drag her amazing self down with me. I was only a burden for her to bear. Either way, my anxiety slowly got better around certain people, an honesty I was on top of the world. I was mentally recovering, no longer addicted, and I had genuine connections to so many people. The year ended. Over the summer we all hung out, having a great time, me not really expecting the shitshow that was about to go down. All but one of my ten moved to an out of state collage or joined the army. I currently maintain regular contact with basically the entire grade, but I was not ready for the beginning of this, my junior year. 

Quiet. Thats all I can describe it as. All of the people id come to know and love were gone. Of course I had, what, 6 people I genuinely liked still there, and I could strike up a conversation with just about anyone, and that I all figured would get me through this year. But it has not. And as luck would have it, I have maybe two classes with anyone I like. I ended up taking a trade class, and the entire class hates me because of the school I go to. I suppose my luck had to run out at some point. Mentally, I’m a train wreck. I&#x27;m getting even less sleep than I normally do. The freezies are back, and the hallucinations are more and more common. I don’t know why. This is all very confusing. Its hard to describe my feelings these days. Words don’t do them justice. Suicide is now a constant idea I entertain, somehow, I find the idea of death welcoming. Its just so hard, going on like this, it feels as if every day I’m being crushed with the disappointment my father feels in me, the loneliness, all coupled with the guilt is heart wrenchingly painful. The hallucinations don’t help. I&#x27;ve almost become content with the motives of the killers I hallucinate. Is that a sign, by the way, the dreams? I don’t have a clue. At this point I feel empty and lifeless, and its only so long before I can no longer put up the act. Any advice is appreciated, but, as I said, don’t waste your time, I’m likely a lost cause.</div>

            <div class="content">Okay this will be a long one, but I&#x27;ll try to form coherent sentences so this makes sense and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes to read. I&#x27;m really sleep deprived, in a lowkey paranoical state and I&#x27;m not a native speaker. Disclaimer: strong language.

&amp;#x200B;

I&#x27;ll have to start from the beginning for better understanding of my situation. 

Last winter I met this really hot girl while walking my dog. She had the same rare breed and we started talking. Turned out we were both Russian (we live in Germany), were both mid 20&#x27;s and well, all these similarities were a solid base to hit it off. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, she was way out my league, im at best average looking and lanky. She had long blonde hair, full lips, perfect body, and so on. Think of a younger Charlize Theron, just a little &quot;sluttier&quot;. 

I didn&#x27;t even bother thinking about getting closer to her, I was sure she has a fitness model or a rich lawyer as SO. We hung out from time to time, talked a lot about our dogs, who also had fun together and so on. 

One led to another, we went to a party, got drunk a bit and made out. I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck when she agreed coming into my apartment to spend the night. 

We kinda started dating the next two weeks, I was genuinely happy but I swear I had a really weird feeling about all this. It was all too perfect and something had to be wrong with her right? Nah, I&#x27;m just being paranoid, no need to worry. 

Oh boy... was I wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly before New Years Eve I spontaneously decided to go to a local club with a couple of friends and invited her aswell. She didn&#x27;t like the club and didn&#x27;t want to go. I asked if she has some other plans, which she didn&#x27;t, and that I would be happy if she joined, but that I would go without her otherwise. Oh boy, that was a huge problem for her. Please note that we were &quot;dating&quot; for 2-3 weeks at this point. She asked who the fuck I think I was for telling her that, why I didn&#x27;t talk with her about this beforehand etc. I told her that it was spontaneous and that didn&#x27;t understand her problem  - &quot;I&#x27;m just spending time with my friends&quot; I said. She blocked me on WhatsApp and I understood that as a &quot;fuck off&quot;. I was a bit sad, but as mentioned before I had a weird feeling anyway, so I carried on without minding it too much. 

A couple of days after New Years&#x27; she called me and said that she forgot her expensive brush at my apartment and wanted it back. Well we talked for a while and got together again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until summer we had a somewhat toxic on and off relationship. She would get really, I mean really mad at many small things. Once when we were shopping for dinner I accidentaly put the wine bottle in her cart. She ran away and screamed at me &quot;Since when does a woman have to pay for her drinks?!&quot;. I explained her that I had no issues with buying a 6€ bottle for us and that I put it in her cart by accident. Nope, I&#x27;m a stingy jewish asshole and don&#x27;t know how to take care of a woman she said (I&#x27;m not even jewish lol). After one day of apologies from me we got along again.

&amp;#x200B;

Once i went to a club with my best friend (at least she tolerated that), then his girlfriend and one of her friends joined. I didn&#x27;t know that this would happen and didn&#x27;t think much of it. We had a fun time and I went home. The next day I get furious texts from her, asking who I was with and that someone saw me with another girl there. I explained her the situation, not thinking that something was wrong, since I didn&#x27;t do anything even close to cheating and had a clean conscience. Nope, it was my duty to inform her at 2a.m. that someone joined us and that they were female and because if didn&#x27;t tell it, it was cheating for sure, She was delusional and 100% resistant to logical explanation. She told me to cut ties with all female friends I have or she would leave me. And I obeyed. I was not allowed to have contact to females and she would demand to check my phone, and even when were was nothing suspicious she accused me of deleting converstions.

&amp;#x200B;

These two cases are just examples. We had stuff like this like twice a month. 

Now you ask, well Mr. Midnight, are you mental? Why would you let yourself manipulate like this? Aren&#x27;t this enough red flags? Well because that girl pushed my ego and I unfortunately think too much with my cock which she took really good care of. She was constatly in mood, did everything I wanted and cooked me food afterwards.  Literal dreamgirl at this point for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes my major fuckup.

Did I mention that she lived together that her ex-husband? Well now you know. He was moving away and I told her that I will help her find a new flat. Big no-no for her. We were already dating 6 months! Woo! How dare you! You just want to fuck me, you don&#x27;t take me serious! I was so hoping that you would suggest to move together! She blocked me everywhere and bascially broke up. I was devastated, I just wanted to help, she dropped no hints regarding moving together whatsoever, just informed me that she will have to leave the flat. 

After two days of running after her losing the last bits of my dignity she agreed to come back together if we moved together, although me (and everyone else I talked about this issue) had serious doubts about my decision and urged me to leave her as long as I could, since my friends and my mom knew by now how toxic she was. Nope, Mr. Midnight listens to his dick and pushed ego. 

Of course she chose a very expensive flat which was over our budged. And guess who had to pay for it. I&#x27;m not a rich guy, but I managed to pile up some good money because I was living in a humble situation and had an okay-ish job as floor manager (sounds cooler as it is) in an IT service desk. I neutered my dog (hers was a girl, so of course mine had to get the treatment), organized the whole move in 2 weeks, which was more than stressful, and beforehand payed for a vacation in the alps because she felt &quot;burnt out&quot;, in other words she manipulated me into going on vacation although it was the worst possible timing, but my dumbass does as the lady demands. Not a single thank you from her side by the way. I got really stressed out and we got in a really big fight the next day after we moved because she complained about literally everything and I snapped and told her that if everything is so bad she should have taken things into her hands instead of letting me do everything, or at least say thank you once in a lifetime 

The fight escalated really bad, she beat me several times, bit and scratched me, I had bruises and cuts all over my neck and arms. I tried to defend myself without hurting her, because you know, who would the police rather believe, a charming, beautiful, young woman or an 1,93m (6&#x27;3) guy with a death stare as default facial expression. Take a guess. I didn&#x27;t feel like getting arrested for domestical violence. She ended up with red spots on her wrists where i was holding her and threatened to call the police on me or some of her orbiters to beat me up. 

During the fight she told me that she would kill me, called me names that I unfortunately (or not?) don&#x27;t know the translation to, went from sobbing into blind rage in 5 minute gaps. Total psycho shit. I was terrified and I have to admit that I feared for my life and my belongings. Imagine her sitting butt naked with her knee on your throat hissing slurs like she&#x27;s posessed.

I don&#x27;t remember how, but we somehow settled the issue. Something alongside a stressful month and that we had to relief it somehow. My friends who were aware fot he situation told me to literally run. My mother wanted to come over, she feared that I will get poisoned. 

None of this happened, but living with this person in peace was a challenge. She demanded constant attention, got angry when I didn&#x27;t do the chores and prepared the food before she came home (she left work 1.30hrs after me and I always  had to walk the dogs). If everything was done to her approval we actually had a good time. But god forbid if I wanted to do something alone like gaming or watching my shows. Everything I did was stupid and childish in her eyes, she threated to destroy my gaming rig multiple times and calling the police beforehand so that I coulnd&#x27;t do anything with her in response. This comes from a person who spends the whole day on her phone. A person without actual friends, just tons of male orbiters. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could literally write a whole book about the sick delusional shit she was saying or doing, but this post is already long enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week we went on a vacation (which I obviously payed - with my last money because guess who had to buy new furniture for the flat. Hint: not her). It was okay although I spent waiting most of the time for her getting ready and following her around making photos of her. Yep, I lost the rest of my dignity and self-respect already if you didn&#x27;t notice. She spent all the time on her phone commanding me around, in a nice way though, still I was getting pissed because I didn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m relaxing. I still was very nice to her because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin the vacation. Apparently she noticed that by now I was her humble servant who can be paid in quick blowjobs. We got to the point where she would hiss at me if I had to go to the toilet or sneezed. She also whined all the time about literally everything, nothing was good enough, the hotel, the tours, the beach. This built up my annoyance but i kept my cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the breaking point, which happened two days ago. my mother was watching our dogs at home while we were on vacation, aaand as you might guess, my girlfriend and my mother didn&#x27;t get along very well. They were nice on the outside to each other but I had to listed to them complain about each other to me quite often. 

When we got home my mom politely said that everything was fine, but that my GF&#x27;s dog was pissing on the floor quite often and that it was a mess and she had a hard time because of the dog. This is an issue for my mom because she is old and has problems with her back. My GF took that as a personal attack, didn&#x27;t say anything to her though. When my mom left my GF snapped and said something along &quot;Who the fuck is this old ugly bitch think she is?! This crazy whore annoys the shit out of me&quot;. I thought I heard wrong and asked her to repeat. She came really close to me and repeated the same to my face with a smug expression. I got really mad, but I just clenched by buttcheecks and went away minding my own business. The same day her friend came over, she&#x27;s like the only one of her &quot;friends&quot; I got to know, another russian girl, which I got along well. My GF constantly talked shit about her behind her back, about her being ugly, an annoyance etc, but she was really nice to her in person. 

I don&#x27;t know how but when the freind came I couldn&#x27;t containt my built up anger and unleashed everything on my GF, told her how entitled, manipulative, psychotic, mendacious, shallow and hypocritical she is. Confronted her about the stuff she talks about her friend behind her back. As usually in public she played the poor little girl card and ran way crying, followed by her friend who didn&#x27;t believe a word I said. Everyone who knew her  superficially admired her, you know. She put on an excellent mask.

When she came back she didn&#x27;t say word and we spent the day in silence. She took a blanket and moved to the couch. 

The next day though, yesterday to be precise, she demanded me to get out of bed and that she will sleep there now. I didn&#x27;t want any more confrontations and just wanted to end this peacefully, so I went to the couch without saying a word. She didn&#x27;t like that, she was accustomed to the fact that I always came crawling back, so that escalated in another fight and another physical assault on myself. I tried to scare her and put on the evilest grin I could, laughed her off, told her how pathetic she is. Boy was she mad. She again went into that stage when in one moment she was sobbing and hyperventilating,  then blind rage, changing like every minute. She kinda gave up and declared she will move out but will make sure she will make the rest of our time living together a hell for me. Now you might say this is just stupid threat from and angry woman, but I shit you not, everyone is on her side, she manipulated everyone, except a couple of my friends and my mom that I am a psychotic wifebeater and basically the bad guy who constantly ruins our wonderful relationship with his behavior.

My friends offered me to crash at their places. My mom urged me to talk to my landlord about the leasing contract and if we could figure something out so that I can move out (I can&#x27;t afford the rent alone and the landlord knows it). 

Nonetheless I&#x27;m genuinely terrified of what my now Ex-GF meant with that she will make the rest of our time together hell. I don&#x27;t know if I can can some legal insurance for myself, my dog and my belongings. 

What would you do or suggest?

            <div class="content">So, last year the mother of my children and I fell out and broke up/separated (around march 2016) etc. My best friend (f/33) (we will call her &quot;J&quot;)and I (m/31)met about late 2015. She was there for me completely through my hardest time. Would check up on me. Make sure I was okay, threw me a bday party so &quot;you&#x27;d remember people still love you for who you are&quot; (my ex left me in f*cked up circumstances.) But around Halloween 2016 or so we just clicked and started talking more often etc. NOW, she has a boyfriend so let&#x27;s keep this in mind. But, every time we go to a party or hang out we become closer. About march or so of 2017 I told her I love her as a human and she told me I&#x27;m her favorite person in the world. Not much later we started talking everyday and are really just innocently friends. But since about late June I&#x27;ve started getting feelings for her... And so I just keep my mouth shut because she is a perfect friend. Well her bf one day shows me his penis and asked me if I&#x27;m in love with her (we were drunk) I told him yes, because it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m a very honest person so he replied &quot;well I trust you regardless.&quot; This was early July, apparently he accused her of fucking me two days later. Since then we both talked to him and things seemed to calm down. Since late July our conversations are slowly drifting. I&#x27;ll realize we are being lovey or too romantic with each other. We went on a trip together in july (over 12 hour drive) and I thought this would humanize her and thus I&#x27;d feel less romantic for her. Not at all what happened. We got stuck in the rain, got along the whole time and when I laid down she pulled over and laid down in the back with me. Since that trip she is a lot more affectionate and in the last like 2-3 weeks we have even turned to moments where I realize we are being too sexual with each other both via text and talking. IDK what to do /adv. I love her very dearly as a friend, don&#x27;t wanna hurt her bf, not sure if want to be with her. I&#x27;m afraid to ruin my friendship with my best friend either by trying to make it a relationship and it fail or by withdrawing and her thinking I don&#x27;t like her etc. I feel like it&#x27;s going to come to a head one way or another. I just don&#x27;t know how to rectify the situation. I&#x27;m not going to do anything with her unless she is single first and foremost. The reason why I&#x27;m writing is I feel like their relationship is coming to an end. So I&#x27;m afraid it will come up soon. Feel free to ask questions to give better advice. I&#x27;ll reply asap. Thank you</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3j8kwl/im_28f_forced_to_hang_with_a_person_i_dont_like/" target="_blank" class="title">I&#x27;m (28F) forced to hang with a person I don&#x27;t like (27F), but I feel like a terrible person and need a way to cope.</a>
            <div class="content">This person I don&#x27;t like is my SO&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s girlfriend. Let&#x27;s call her Chels (sorry, Chelsea/Chelseys of the world). I&#x27;ve known her for almost 7 years, the duration of my relationship with my SO. Her bf is a really, *really* nice guy.

Before even meeting Chels, I was warned by my SO that she&#x27;s a super jealous type so I was asked to not look at her bf aka my SO&#x27;s best friend. I complied. Since then, I&#x27;ve seen her remain a constant cluster of an immature, irresponsible, at times verbally and physically abusive, fickle, judgmental, Ms. know-it-all. Here are some examples of time when I&#x27;ve rolled my eyes and wished I didn&#x27;t have to hang out with her anymore:

* Chels was a vegan when I first met her because she cared about animal rights. She was adamant about shoving her opinion and guilt trips down every meat-eaters&#x27; throats. Once she converted back to being a meat-eater, she confessed that she was just vegan to lose weight, which didn&#x27;t happen.
* In the last couple of years, she&#x27;s been on and off with this health kick (e.g. weight lifting, avoiding carbs, took one nutrition class) and will talk down to people about their diet/exercise despite not following her own advice. Some of her health advice is absolutely wrong but she won&#x27;t budge even with evidence.
* At a pool party which involved just the four of us, she became drunk and intentionally hit her bf in the head with a metal, pool cleaning pole because he wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention to her. He was a bit drunk too so he was just trying to chill out for a bit. She became more upset that he seemed to not agree with her view and attempted to clean things. She dropped a glass jar of red dip that a more sober me had to clean for her. She cried and we had to console her. Best pool party evar. /s
* Chels will jokingly insult my SO by calling him names and talking about his inadequate penis, but when anyone jokes about her bf, she&#x27;s up in arms. She&#x27;ll regularly put down her own bf by calling him fat or lazy, among other things, in a non-joking tone.

Over the years, I&#x27;ve observed exactly zero instances of any redeeming qualities other than her bf is somehow happy or at least content with the relationship. I think he can do better and deserves better, but it&#x27;s not my place to voice that to him.

My SO agrees with my opinions of Chels but he&#x27;s found his own coping mechanism since he&#x27;s known her since high school. Most of the time, he&#x27;ll just ignore the stupid that comes out of her mouth or change topics. At times, he&#x27;ll confront her and let her know that she&#x27;s &quot;being a stupid bitch&quot; (his words, not mine), but in a half-joking manner. He&#x27;s stated that if the two were to ever break-up, which is very unlikely, he would stop hanging out with Chels.

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve picked up on all the negative emotions I have with Chels at this point, and that&#x27;s precisely my problem. I&#x27;m a very patient, tolerant, optimistic person. I give people the benefit of the doubt, but since Chels hasn&#x27;t shown any growth, I&#x27;m unable to tolerate her stupid shit anymore. I feel like a terrible person to feel so negatively towards someone. Unlike my SO, I haven&#x27;t been able to find my own coping mechanism. I can ignore some of the stupid that comes out of her by not looking at her directly, but my instinct is to correct the misinformation. Chels doesn&#x27;t back down because she thinks she&#x27;s an expert in everything and is always right. I think Chels acts that way she does because she has some serious insecurities about herself (SO agrees on this too) but her coping methods annoy and sometimes piss me off. My SO suggested I stop caring so much, which is easier said than done. I don&#x27;t know how to stop caring, how to stop feeling the negative emotions/thoughts that come about when she acts like an annoying high schooler. I wish she would just grow up, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen. 

Not hanging out when she&#x27;s around isn&#x27;t really a viable option. They moved to our city a couple years ago and they&#x27;re now integrated in our circle of friends. Not hanging with her means I don&#x27;t get to hang out with the friends I enjoy. We also can&#x27;t just invite her bf because they&#x27;re attached at the hip. They always do things together. ALWAYS.

Halp.

**TL;DR** My SO&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s girlfriend is an insecure clusterfuck that copes by being an inconsiderate, immature, irresponsible, judgmental, hypocritical Ms. know-it-all. I have to hang with her at least once a week. My patience is running low and I need a way to deal so I can have fun while hanging with this person that I borderline hate.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2ukzy0/im_pretty_much_the_closest_thing_to_a_32_year_old/" target="_blank" class="title">I’m pretty much the closest thing to a 32 year old virgin that I’ve ever known and I need dating advise.</a>
            <div class="content">I desperately want to date. Mainly for sex. Sure I want conversation. And sharing interests. But those moments when the eyes staring back at me from a woman&#x27;s naked body are filled with nothing but desire and acceptance. 

The thing is that I just ended a ten year relationship my wife. And no. There was no cheating, no massive financial disagreements, no violence. Hell, I still consider her a great person. I just hate being with her. It&#x27;s toxic for me. I was dying. My being with her meant that on some level I accepted that I was a piece of shit who didn&#x27;t deserve to live. Let me explain.

You see I&#x27;m a survivor. I survived two years of being raped by my mothers&#x27; boyfriend. All the males, three other adults, in my household knew what he was doing, sometimes exactly at the moment he was doing it. Lately in therapy I started to realize that my mother probably knew. She was often in the the adjacent room “sleeping.” It’s likely she just looked the other way. After all my mother spent most of my upbringing ignoring me. Literally.

Unless others were in the house or she and I were outside, my mother would behave as if I wasn&#x27;t there. That is until she would find something that I did wrong. Not a hard thing for her to do being that I was a child. And that&#x27;s when the temper tantrums came. Not my tantrums. Hers&#x27;.

Shouting. In my face. Sometimes for hours. Throwing things. Loud. At the top of her lungs. She hit herself, cried, pulled her hair and stomped her feet. Rarely did she respond to my words or look at me directly. Red in the face, hysterically sobbing and shaking with anger she would belt out deranged encouragement and disappointment at me. 

The questions seemed endless and poured out of her mouth, along with forceful croaking and slobber, as if they were on fire. Her voice would became horse in a matter of minutes almost every time. Why I didn&#x27;t I &#x27;clean the house,&#x27; or &#x27;washed the dishes&#x27; or &#x27;do my homework,&#x27; she screeched for the neighborhood to hear.

She never showed me how to do any of these things. She rarely helped me with homework in elementary school and never did so after middle school. But she expected that my eight, nine, ten years old self should have suddenly figured out algebra, which cleaning spray to use on which surface or where to put any of the piles of her magazines, papers and clothes that where almost always about the house. Unless the job was completely done with no mistakes she would start talking to herself. Quietly at first then louder as she wound herself up. There was no way to meet her expectations properly. At a certain point I mostly stopped trying and just prepared for the inevitable all consuming rage.

Over time I accepted that I was a disgusting worthless piece of a human being that deserved no attention other than emotional terror and false praise from my mother. From the age of ten on there was no one else in the house. She told me my father denied that I was his child from birth and never met me. From middle school on there were no abusive boyfriends, no roommates, no caregivers. It was just me and her for 13 years.

I grew up secretly believing that my mother would have preferred that I kill myself. Of course, in a manner that would allow her to play the role of the grieving mother. Not in a way where my death would make others judge her a poor mother. Everyone knew she was a great mother. Everyone. Even me.

I was alive, fed and clothed. She went to parent teacher nights. Many parents didn&#x27;t. Plus she sent me away to camp as much as she could afford to in the summers. In fact when she could afford to she always sent me away. We never vacationed together once. Ever. Not even for a weekend. Rarely did she hug or kiss me when no one was around. I don&#x27;t remember her saying I love you. Of course unless we were in front of others. Then she would behave warm and lovingly. I was sure she loved me. 

Still I survived. I had no idea what survivor meant. I thought it meant weak. Hell anyone can survive a few years of childhood rape and 13 years of yelling. Or so I thought. My mother raised me to believe that I was lucky to have a roof, food and clothes. Others didn&#x27;t. Friends of mine got hit when their parents were mad. I had little to complain about. Survivors had injuries. I had none. Survivors had missing limbs. I had very part of my body I was born with. Survivors didn&#x27;t wish they were dead all the time. I did. All the time. All the fucking time.

I also wished that I was fucking girls that I liked all the time. It went beyond normal adolescence. I suspect that it was about needing to be held. Embraced. Desired. Wanted. Loved. And none of it would be real unless my dick is inside a wanting women&#x27;s wet pussy.

The problem is these feelings never stopped. Now at the age of 32 the thought of a woman&#x27;s embrace is a constant urge, feelings that other guys my age talk about as if they ended years ago. And while there are plenty of other single people my age looking for affection I feel utterly alone. Unlike them, I have none of the social skills that come with having been in relationships. I say that because I’m pretty much the closest thing to a 32 year old virgin that I’ve ever known. I have only been with one woman in my life and that was a lie.

My rapist introduced me to porn at an early age before he ever took advantage of me. Sometimes all the other guys in the house would watch the rented VHS tapes too. Other times it was just me and him. I loved it. I was part of the man&#x27;s world well before my time. I was special. I wanted to fuck beautiful women. Years after my rape ended, porn was the only part of my life that I allowed myself to chose what I wanted sexually. Porn helped me survive.

My rapist was in his twenties. He would flirt with girls his age in front of me and afterwards would ask if I wanted to hook up with them. Of course I said yes. They were so beautiful like the girls in the porno. I would fantasize about being inside them and they would cum loudly and passionately expressing how much they wanted and loved me. But he used that idea to rape me.

At first he started claiming to show me a few pointers on women. Later it became putting me to bed or just tickling and wrestling. As I caught on it increasingly became just waking up from the pain of his attack. The beginning always changed because as soon as I saw what was coming I&#x27;d try to get away. But no matter what I did it ended with him forcing himself inside me while he lay on top of me so that I couldn&#x27;t get away. He often would hold his hand over my mouth so that no one could hear me scream. Depending on who was home he would let me cry because my crying didn&#x27;t matter. He&#x27;d say things pretending he was consoling or disciplining me. I thought he was fooling our roommates. I wasn&#x27;t aware at the time that the the other adults knew and he was just fooling me. 

As the months passed I stopped crying because I became so good at imagining something else was going on. Every once in a while that something else was desire for a women&#x27;s wanting sexuality. That was good. But most of the time that something else would be him blowing my head off with a gun or me jumping off a rooftop so that the pain would stop. Death was better than being his condom, unwrapped then tossed or flushed as he saw fit.

I was six when the rape started. I was eight when it was over. But my need to be physically intimate with women I find attractive is still not over.

Over the years, I hit emotional bottoms. I was in a very dark place for most of high school. I discovered people who cared about me. I found a chosen family in my late teens. But I told them nothing. For more than twenty years since I was raped no one knew. Not one person. But my chosen family loved me. They helped me survive.

I tried to be normal. My chosen family was normal. I had normal friends. I tried to be like them. It usually didn&#x27;t work. Since it was rare for me to actually see love and difficult for me to interpret it as genuine, I formed expectations about healthy intimate inter-personal relationships mainly from Saved by the Bell, A Different World,  Full House, The Fresh Prince, Family Matters, Dawson&#x27;s Creek, American Pie and porn.

I preformed, not lived, in casual settings when I was expected to make conversation or be warm hearted or just nice. When I was alone I occasionally  had panic attacks in the hours or weeks after simply listening friends talk about physical intimacy with the opposite sex. Around others I simply seemed shy or just weird.

In my mind I wanted to be with a girl. Lots of girls. But for more than ten years I couldn&#x27;t flirt or come on to a woman. I didn&#x27;t even let myself make direct eye contact with attractive women. That wasn’t allowed. That could never happen. Not for someone worthless like me. I was certain that no woman would want to make purposeful eye contact with me to express affection. No young women would want to be with a stupid, ugly little boy. Since it was utterly impossible in my mind for any girl to be attracted to me I snuck long gazes using mirrors and reflections in the glass until my 20s.

A few girls that I was attracted to had hit on me. But as much as I wanted to I could not put my hand over Ruby&#x27;s hand when she took my palm and told me she liked me in middle school. I could not pull Julia closer when she was dancing and putting her boobs in my face a year later. I could not even talk to Dana, who, by her own initiative, touched my hard on during class my freshman year in high school. The list of girls who undeniably expressed physical affection towards me grew. 

But as much as I wanted to be with all of them the most that I managed to do was ask Ciara out on a date. I was twenty. Nearly a decade had passed since I was consciously attracted to girls. And even then, in the dark movie theater as Ciara wrapped her leg around mine and pulled me closer to her I could not give myself permission to touch her. We didn&#x27;t even kiss. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to.

I was a piece of shit who wasn&#x27;t worth anyone&#x27;s attention, much less the affections of a woman. Ciara and all the other girls probably wanted to humiliate me by pretending they liked me then showing all their friends how I thought the girl had really like me.

Me. Of all people. Why would anyone want to be with me? I was a monster. In elementary and middle school, I stalked the neighborhoods of girls I liked on my bike hoping that I would &quot;accidentally&quot; run into them. I sought out the porn magazines left in the alleyways behind my building. By high school I graduated to dail-up internet. I was a pervert who got off women forced to exploit themselves for money. Many of them probably got raped like me.

I had violent rage. Looking at myself in the mirror would produce seemingly spontaneous utterances of &quot;I hate you&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you&quot; from my own mouth. I felt like a fool for letting my awkwardness stop me from getting with a girl. I wanted to kill myself for being so stupid. From as early as the age of eight I hit myself on the head to hide the bruises. As a teen I zoned out for hours with TV, books, movies, video games and porn. Anything to keep me from actually coming up with a plan to end the pain. I thought that others saw me as a boring loser because all I did was read, watch TV and play video games. When I though about girls in my youth I would first imagine girls I saw in the street naked, flirty and me inside them. But then almost immediately in my mind, beautiful girls would come to find out how much of a loser in a near intimate situation with me. They would try to get out but I would force myself on them. In the world between my ears, I was a rapist, even though in real life I never even kissed a girl.

I  wanted to die or get lucky. But I knew I didn&#x27;t deserve to get lucky so I mostly just wanted to die. For more than a decade I convinced myself that I didn&#x27;t deserve to be with anyone. I barely deserved to be alive. If anything I deserved to be shot in the head by shotgun, a stray bullet or by my own hands. I was eleven when ideas like this were an everyday thought. I imagined it all the time for nearly twenty years. Some times I still do.

I joined the military because I thought if I died in war I would at least be useful to someone. I&#x27;d be remembered as a good person. Even if I was a really just a piece of shit.

When orders came for my unit to deploy to Iraq I was terrified. Not of death. I relished the idea of jumping on the proverbial grenade, killing anyone trying to kill me, or working on a wounded friend even if he didn&#x27;t survive. But I was terrified of dying a virgin. For a moment what I wanted was more important than the piece of shit I thought I was.

In that moment before I deployed I wanted to get laid by Ana or Jasmine. I expected that either Ana or Jasmine and I would hook up for a few weeks and break up. Perfect for a deployment. Perfect for an average 20 year old. But I didn&#x27;t deserve perfect. Much less good. I never allowed myself to tell either one I liked them. I chose Camila.

Camila was marriage material. I didn&#x27;t want marriage. That was perfect. I would be able to be normal in everyone else&#x27;s eyes and hate myself, all at the same time. The moment where I cared about my desires was over. Camila was the first girl that I&#x27;d told her I liked her. I was 23. 

I did what I had to do to get laid. I pretended to be romantic. I pretended to think that Camila was the one. I dropped lines from romantic poems I&#x27;d read and behaved as I&#x27;d seen romantic guys in television shows and movies behave. I talked about grandkids on the first date. I married her three years later. Five years after that we had a kid.

Camila helped me survive. Camila cared for me even when I didn&#x27;t and on some level I accepted some her care. But our relationship was mostly all a lie. Even when I was able to allow myself to be with someone I was not allowed to be with someone I liked, much less loved. Worst of all I pretended that I knew what love was. The truth that I&#x27;ve come to realize now after years of therapy is that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever experienced the emotion for another person. Not anyone. Not ever. Definitely not for myself.

My marriage drove me crazy. From the beginning I wanted to leave Camila because I knew that she wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. But I stayed with her because I&#x27;d be an asshole if I left. To end it I’d have to lie or tell the truth, both of which meant that I was a piece of shit. No matter what, she would realize I was just wasting her life and had been fooled into falling in love. And who was fuck was I to hurt anyone else&#x27;s feelings that I cared about? I wanted to kill myself. 

What kind of sick degenerate human being marries and stays with someone just to pretend to be normal? What kind of selfish monster was I? I didn&#x27;t deserve to speak up. Much less live. Since I gave myself the privilege of being alive I would have to put up with a relationship that I never wanted to be in in the first place. To pay for being a sick degenerate monster I was as supportive as I could be to Camila, to the point of being her emotional doormat. Most people thought I was just a &quot;nice&quot; guy.

Therapy saved me. Years of intense effort has finally allowed me to want to live without the fear and hesitation of obsessing of how I should live. I ended my marriage with Camila and am looking to date. Even though none of this is how I &quot;should&quot; behave, I deserve happiness and my daughter deserves me. A father who stands up for himself, is an authentic person and most importantly is alive to see her grow into an adult. But in trying to date I&#x27;ve realized that I really am an asshole and that is not who I want to be.

Nearly every girl I hit on in person in the past few months said that my feelings for them were unexpected and not in a good way. I got as far as making out with one girl who ultimately said no to going further because I was too inconsiderate with my touch towards her. The first time that I bought a girl a drink we danced, she gave me her number and then later in the night I couldn&#x27;t remember her name. It didn&#x27;t help that I was whispering it in her ear while she was grinding on me. My asking her for her name as I was leaving the club killed that prospect. The next time I went to the club I hit on at least 30 girls (not an exaggeration, an actual count by a friend) and was too drunk to remember approaching half of them. None of them wanted to talk to me.

Online I messaged more than 200 girls on internet dating sites usually by binge messaging fifteen or more at a time. I&#x27;ve had seven or so respond to me after I learned to craft better messages. Only two or so have gotten past a few messages and none have ever wanted to meet, except one woman who was older than I cared for. 

At work one colleague went out of her way to say hello to me and then weeks later went out of her way again to invite me to have lunch with her and her friend. At a certain point when all I could think of was hitting on her I realized that I was an asshole. Fortunately I just shut up despite looking as if I was suddenly mute. I played it off and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to approach her romantically when I learn to do that. But the moment I realized that I had nothing to express other than that I wanted to fuck her was when I hoped a crazed shotgun wielding killer would do me and the world the huge favor of blowing my head away.

Using skills I learned in therapy I shut down those thoughts of self harm pretty quickly. But I still haven’t learned to be entirely comfortable with myself and maybe that’s why women aren’t comfortable with me. But that age were everyone else is as awkward and as lost with the opposite sex and is as brand new to intimate relationships as I am is over for most people my age. What normally happens during adolescence for others is happening now for me. For the first time I’ve accepted that women could be attracted to me. That I’m worth being with. That I’m a good person. But all that I can genuinely manage to feel towards women is sexual desire. Not exclusively. I’ve always had and continue to make new female friends. But sex is what’s foremost in my mind when I interact with many of the women I encounter. Especially those I consider physically attractive and whose personalities make me smile.

I know I have things to work on. I want to be a person who gives a shit about myself all the time. I want to love myself, not wish for my own death on a daily or weekly basis. I&#x27;m much better than I was when my own death was more than hourly thought. But I&#x27;m not at the point where dark thoughts are a once in a blue moon thing. Love for one&#x27;s self, what I had always assumed was shameful conceit in others and therefore something undesirable for myself, is something I&#x27;m learning about intellectually. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve lived emotionally for a matter of weeks or months at a time.

But what do I do in the meantime? While I&#x27;m working out the fat I gained through self hate? While I care for myself more? I&#x27;m only getting older. Most people my age have been in several relationships, experiences that I envy and lack. I&#x27;ve never had my heart broken. I&#x27;ve never felt romantic passion, intimacy or trust for a woman. How can I related to women, also in their early 30s or late twenties, when they&#x27;re been dealing with relationships for a decade? I&#x27;ve only ever been with one woman in my entire life. My lack of experience is like a massive gulf from which I only see an abyss between me and everyone else that I know my age.

My emotional immaturity is evident to those around me to the point where three separate people on three separate occasions have told me I was behaving like a 17 year old. None of them know what you&#x27;ve just you read. One of my closest friends, one of the few people in my life that knows everything, has chided, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you over doing the whole mid-life crisis thing already?&quot; and &quot;You can&#x27;t go back in time just because you didn&#x27;t do those things back then.&quot;

Everyone, it seems, is sure that I need to act my age. The problem is that this is my age. I&#x27;m not acting. For the first time I&#x27;m being real. How I really always have been. A lusty, horny, good for nothing guy.  I know that I could lie. But then what&#x27;s the point? I would just hate myself again. All I want is a turbulent, messy, immature relationship that lasts a few weeks. I want an inkling of an authentic relationship, or several relationships, even if it isn&#x27;t all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. But why is it so hard? What the hell am I doing wrong?

            <div class="content">What follows is extremely detailed... Just give me some good revengence ideas for a terrible human being/former boss if you don&#x27;t feel like reading...   



I work as a server. Generally speaking, we&#x27;re a pretty expendable species. However, I had been at this job for over 3 and a half years, I put a lot of energy, my own time, my heart, my soul and some serious sweat over those years.   



I had successfully built a solid relationship with all staff, front, back, management, owner, executive chefs, you get the idea. This was a business that always touted the ideal of &quot;People first, profit follows&quot;. I had worked my way up into management after nearly 2 years of working my ass off with very little reward. After being promoted, I still served, but also started doing a lot of admin work. I revamped the orientation package, I worked on the food syllabus endlessly, I was promoted to do scheduling. Then, we decided to expand. That&#x27;s when we hired our operations manager, a guy I&#x27;ll call Richard. Dick for short.   



Through our expansion of our sister restaurant, I was still very involved in management, training and serving. A year later, we decided to move our first location to a bigger, swankier place on the water. Throughout this time, I was working to develop a good working relationship with Dick. At that point, I took on the company newsletter.   



Upon shutting down the original location to move to the new one, I was informed by Dick that my position as Floor Manager (essentially a position below a full-time shift manager) would be temporarily terminated as, according to him, our owner couldn&#x27;t see the justification for my position.   


Fine, okay, no big deal.   



A week later, I receive a &quot;management only&quot; email detailing a meeting in which they discussed letting go of 5 members of our team. This was after management, and Dick, swore up and down that everyone still had a job once the move was done. I was shocked, of course, and kept my mouth shut despite the fact I received the email on my birthday and would be celebrating with some of the 5 on the aforementioned list.   



At my party, I confronted a full-time manager about the situation. A colleague unfortunately overheard and asked me about it later that evening. All I said was &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re fine. I got an email that I probably shouldn&#x27;t have received, but you don&#x27;t have anything to worry about.&quot; Now, this colleague apparently told others about it, and I was reprimanded by Dick a couple of days later. He made it seem as if I deliberately told people about the specific contents of the email. I was suspended for a week and relieved of any future possibility in management.   



Even though I didn&#x27;t any info, and the email that was sent never stated anything to do with confidentiality, I ended up being the scapegoat.    



Fine, whatever, moving on.   



New location opens, management turns to shit. Huge overhaul in management, terribly childish rules imposed on the team, I&#x27;m still trying to remain positive. Upon opening, I receive a &quot;written verbal warning&quot;, because I leave my work shoes there... (Many did... I was the only recipient of said written verbal bullshit.).  



Uhhh, all right... Really? Fuck, okay.   



New rule, no facial piercings except for nostrils, and only studs. I had been working in this fine dining establishment for over 2 years with no issues about my piercing. It&#x27;s small, barely noticeable, aaaand I was the only person that had a facial piercing other than the nose. I comply, only to realize that the nose piecing rule has not been complied with, nor enforced. There&#x27;s a girl with a bullring, but she never got reprimanded, and they go ahead and hire people with visible, multiple surface piercings... Somehow I end up being singled out for my piercing over and over. I ask to talk to Dick about it, and he completely ignores me. Responds to my request to &quot;discuss the issue in an empathetic manner&quot; with &quot;I don&#x27;t have time&quot;, while reserving time for others.   



Now I&#x27;m starting to take things personally... But I still comply.   



I get tasked with an assignment for the company newsletter. Write an article and take pictures of the new brunch menu offered at our sister restaurant. Dick says &quot;Brunch is on me&quot;. Great. My partner in the newsletter can&#x27;t make it before our deadline, tells me to go. Thinking I need to get an array of photos, but I don&#x27;t want to waste food, I invite a friend. The evening before brunch, I tell Dick that I&#x27;m bringing a friend and that I&#x27;m not trying to take advantage of the offer. Brunch happens, my friend and I order a decent amount of food. At the end of the meal, we are informed by a manager that Dick has emailed him to tell him to only comp. a couple of items. I never received contact from Dick regarding this change.   




At this point, I&#x27;m done. I tell Dick that I respectfully resign from newsletter duties. He approaches me days after and asks why, I tell him that I really am unsure of where my future lay with the company and that I was frustrated at how he handled things. I imply that I would like to speak with him. He responds as if he never even heard me.   



After that day, I never went out of my way to make small talk with him whenever he came into the restaurant. There were days that I&#x27;d avoid him. In my eyes, he was slowly tearing apart everything I loved about that place. We were being treated like high school kids, just because we wanted to prevent the place from turning into a soulless entity rather than the family atmosphere we loved. Profit started to become more important than individuals.   



A couple of months went by, and on an unsuspecting afternoon, I was called in to speak to Dick. Now I had suspected this meeting had to happen eventually, as I was pulled aside by a manager and told that Dick had noticed I wasn&#x27;t saying Hello anymore. However the meeting ended up being my dismissal. Dick claimed that the management team couldn&#x27;t work with me anymore, that I was difficult to get along with and was inconsistent. No write-ups, no complaints from guests. I asked if I made my guest happy, Dick said that my guests always loved me. I consistently outperformed all the servers there, selling more booze, more features and more per average on a regular basis. I was then informed that they believed the company was &quot;going in a different direction&quot; and that wasn&#x27;t a good fit anymore. They offered me 3 weeks severance for my 3 1/2 years of service (even though we all know servers make their money in tips). I argued and debated my way into convincing Dick to talk to the rest of the management team. He said he would call me with their decision later.   



Dick then left me a voicemail saying all the management team agreed that I should be let go. I had been the 2nd longest member of their front-of-house staff, and trained every single member of their management and administrative team. I thought I had made some really good friends there, but upon hearing that no one spoke up for me, and they all wanted me gone, I was devastated and horribly embarrassed. I had no idea that anything like that would happen. I even reached out to one of the head chef&#x27;s who called himself my brother on many occasions throughout the years, only to be completely ignored by him.    



Over the past months, I&#x27;ve managed to learn a few things:   



1. Dick sent out a company wide email, with my name as the subject, about why I was fired. He implied that I was given &quot;multiple chances to succeed&quot;, among many other false implications.   

2. He allegedly told the management team that they were not to speak to me before, during or after my dismissal at the implied risk of losing their jobs.

3. Many people still employed at the company believe he had it out for me, due to the influence and friendships I had developed.    



So after all that background info, I want to know, how the fuck do I let this go? I loved my job, I loved 99% of the people I worked with, and I worked hard to keep the ideals that I believed our owner shared with the rest of us. Keep your employees happy, and your guests inevitably will be too. I find it hard to see the people that had a hand in letting me go, and I can&#x27;t help but think that if they had said something, together, that I may still have my dignity. Instead, I end up thinking about it, late at night, and posting my woes on the internet.   



I&#x27;m having a hard time forgiving my former friends in management, and honestly, I really want to get back at Dick. I have reason to believe that he&#x27;s using his influence in the city to blacklist me from many potential jobs (enthusiasm, good response from hiring managers, only to never hear back). I am honestly sick of being upset and bitter, but I can&#x27;t seem to let it go because the whole thing feels so unjust.   



It feels good to get this out. Thanks for reading if you did.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1we8iz/some_unsolicited_advice_to_the_nice_guys_of_the/" target="_blank" class="title">Some unsolicited advice to the Nice guys of the world (especially the 16-25 yr olds)</a>
            <div class="content">Welcome to the real world.  If you want to live in a fantasy land where being the nice guy is enough, hit the back space and go up votes some kittens.  If you want a glimpse into the real world.  Read on.  I&#x27;m going to give you some advice that I have collected over the years that I sadly did not know/follow during those wonderful younger years.  I was also a nice guy, I had moments, but not as many as I could have.   So put your ego to the side nice guys and take this to heart.

*And no it isn&#x27;t all original material, I&#x27;m not doing this for fucking Karma I&#x27;m doing it to help out the forever friend zoned nice guy.... **

Glad you are still around.  Everything your parents told you about life, fuck that.  It isn&#x27;t fair, and you sure as hell aren&#x27;t going to change the world by being the nice guy

* But Myhouse, I&#x27;m a nice guy, why don&#x27;t woman want to be with me they say it is the most important thing, are they lying?

No, They are telling the truth, they want a nice guy, but here is the problem, there are over 2 BILLION nice guys on the planet.  That pretty boy with his popped collar and pink shirt, surely he isn&#x27;t a nice guy.  Well you are wrong, that douche is also a nice guy when he needs to be.

* Being a nice guy makes you a faceless sheep in the crowd of 2 billion nice guys.  You think that pretty girl doesn&#x27;t have 20 different people being nice to her every day?  Hell even guys who aren&#x27;t trying to get it in are being nice to her, so why the fuck are you going to stand out?


**The question you have to ask yourself is** What the fuck am I bringing to the table?  What am I doing that stands out, how the fuck am I going to make that persons life better?  And this isn&#x27;t just about getting pussy, its everything in life.  You want the pretty girl, you want the raise.  Despite the media and your mom telling you otherwise, just showing up and being the nice guy isn&#x27;t enough

* You need to bring something to the table, If someone has been stabbed or your company is facing a crisis, is anyone going to give a shit if the nice guy shows up to hand out hugs and let everyone know he is there for them?  Fuck no.  We need a doctor to work on the stab wound, are you a doctor?  NO then get the fuck out of the way.  Do you have a way to fix the company?  No?  Then get the fuck out of the way

See this is why the nice guy losses so often, they forget that being nice doesn&#x27;t mean a fucking thing.  Seriously think about it, if you are stabbed do you want a nice guy who knows nothing about stab wounds or do you want an asshole surgeon?  

* But Myhouse, I don&#x27;t want to be an asshole people should be treated with.... blah blah blah... no shit people should be treated with respect.    No one said you cannot be the nice guy surgeon.  It isn&#x27;t about giving up being nice, its about bringing something to the table that actually matters.

All over reddit we have people talking about how these people deserve more and those people deserve more, but no one is talking about how to actually get it.  Yes we all deserve a beautiful amazing woman on our arms and a job that pays us a &quot;living wage&quot; (what ever the fuck that is)

* Except we all live in the real world, the real question is, what do I need to do to make myself desired by the the beautiful amazing woman, what do I need to do to myself to become the guy that my employer wants.... NEEDS to keep around so he will pay me what I&#x27;m worth.

Stop waiting for shit to happen, look at your life, figure out what you are offering the world.  If you are still reading this odds are you don&#x27;t have much to offer the world other than being a nice guy (maybe a snappy fedora).  That wont&#x27; get you anywhere

* Myhouse you don&#x27;t understand, I suffer from depression and low self esteem.   Well shit, what are you doing about it?  Are you sitting on reddit saying fuck this sucks?  Or are you pushing through the quicksand every day taking a step closer to getting help, to find a way to work around your struggles.  If you aren&#x27;t moving forward you are sinking.  Fuck I get it, its hard as fuck but what did you do to to move forward today?  Did you even take out the trash?  Are you saying you couldn&#x27;t will yourself to take out the trash?  You can always move forward even if its only inches a day.

[This is a link to a great article that covers this](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person_p2/)


* But I&#x27;m not done yet... there is more

So Mr Nice guy, you see people partying and you just don&#x27;t fucking get it do you.  Bunch of retards who are beneath you, fucking repetitive house music and idiots getting drunk acting like fools

* you are right but OHHH SO FUCKING WRONG.  [Go Watch this fucking movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jre6_FBBc0)

Now are you going to be the cool kids.... no Its a fucking movie, the point is look at their faces, look at the fun they are having.  Is it mind numbing crap.... sure as hell is.  The SECRET is, THAT IS THE FUCKING POINT.  It is about letting go, it is about not giving a fuck.   It is about not thinking.  Those people can sit and contemplate just like you do, they can sit there and look at it and say wow those people are idiots, but instead, they are fucking enjoying themselves.  They don&#x27;t give a shit about how they look.  They don&#x27;t care if the beer doesn&#x27;t taste good or if they are going to act stupid




* He Mr Nice respectable guy taking care of the drunk girl, that is noble, hurray for you, but you are missing out on closing your eyes and just letting go.  You are still young, you have sooo much time in life to worry about doing the right thing.


IF you are a loser with no friends, go to a club, wait in line, feel like an idiot, but when you get on the dance floor, just fucking let it go.  Don&#x27;t think, don&#x27;t worry, just fucking be.  You will be amazed at how good of a time you have.  

* see you want people to invite you out, or to come with you when you invite them out, show the world you can let go and just enjoy yourself and not give a shit.  Stop thinking so much.


Ahh and lastly... sex and drugs.... I don&#x27;t give a shit if you ever do drugs, but realize if others want to, it is their fucking life.  You don&#x27;t have to tell them how dangerous they are, people fucking know, it is their life.

* Same with sex, you want to know why the girl goes off and gives a blowjob and gets fingered by the asshole and not the nice guy.  Because the nice guy is going to care about her, the nice guy is going to want to  buy her flowers and show her she is special and that the moment was special.  The asshole, is going to play with her clit, get her off and leave her the fuck alone.

* It isn&#x27;t because she doesn&#x27;t value herself or what ever other pedestal bull shit you want to put on it. its because she is just like you and fucking loves jerking off but its better when someone else does it.

Except she doesn&#x27;t always want a boyfriend right now.  She just wants to get off, and the asshole will get her off without bringing baggage...  Remember what are you bringing to the table?

* THink about it, if a girl makes out with you and lets you finger her, what is the nice guy bringing to that party?  What is the asshole bringing to that party.     Think you would like to just get a hand job by some girl and her never bother you again... would that be a nice night.... she can want the same fucking thing


It isn&#x27;t always about love and romance, sometimes its urges.  And guess what you don&#x27;t have to be an asshole, you just have to get it out that you want to get her off and nothing more.  The best pick up line in the world (for a girl who is just horny and not looking for love).  Damn you look good tonight, I would love to get you off later... and WALK THE FUCK AWAY.

* But Myhouse that goes against what I believe, women are special and should be treated as such.  Cool, if you want to treat a woman like a princess, great, but then you will only get women who want to be treated like a princes and you won&#x27;t get the girl who just wants to get off this Tues evening 

Oh and the want that wants romance, remember she wants more than just a nice guy.


**TL DR, There are 2 billion nice guys in the world, What the fuck are you bringing to the table that makes you stand out because being a nice guy means dick when pretty much everyone is a nice guy**

Have a nice day

            <div class="content">Hi all,

As I am writing this I still don’t know how I feel exactly about the whole event, apart from filthy , a pussy, and overall shame I did not act how I liked would have acted if I wasn’t intoxicated on alcohol, XTC, and poppers.

Moreover, I have no idea how to bring this up to my girlfriend , friends, and family as I feel nobody would understand given that I am a tall 34 yr old male that always stands up himself and others. It happened last week at Tomorrowland, a large festival in Belgium. Been there multiple times and is always great fun, up until last weekend.

We were partying the entire day together, when we headed to the main event on one of the ‘comfort zones,’ an area at the outer ring of the festival zone with great views, only accessible with more expensive tickets. In previous years we always met groups of wealthier people, mostly Asians, that splurged on champagne and other expensive drinks. This year was no different.

After a few hours we made ‘friends’ with a few Thai and Chinese people. Great fun, they pored us drinks from their bottles and the atmosphere was great.

I decided to take some XTC and for an hour all was amazing. That’s when someone offered us poppers. I know this is more of a thing among homosexual man, but thought I give it a try.

It completely knocked me off my feet, dazed me and I had to grap a table to remain on my feet.

Obviously I didn’t well but tried to remain calm as I know the effects of negativity when high on XTC.

I decided to leave the crowded area and walked to the toilet area. I went into a toilet stall and that’s when it happened.

Someone forced himself into my stall, pushed my against a side wall and forced his tongue into my mouth. It happened so quickly, and as this never happened to me before, I completely froze.

He then pulled my shorts down and took my penis in his mouth. I just stared at him for what felt like 10-20 seconds and couldn’t do anything. I felt numb, although my heart was beating out of chest, but I couldn’t react. I didn’t scream, I didn’t hit him and just was overwhelmed and numb.

After those horrible seconds he fortunately stopped and left the stall as quickly as he entered.

I locked the door and sat there for a few minutes to collect my thoughts but couldn’t. Still high on XTC I was afraid and almost panicked and so decided to go back to the event and party, thinking it was not a big deal at the time.

Now, several days later, I am barely eating, feel like a degenerate, filthy, disgraced, and still can’t conclude what to think of it. My girlfriend noticed something is wrong as I am emotional and can’t sleep, but for some reason I just cant get myself to tell anyone about this.

I called in sick today at work, don’t know what to do.

Hope you all can offer some support or advice.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1hea9ag/why_do_these_things_leave_us_with_horrible_shame/" target="_blank" class="title">Why do these things leave us with horrible shame and guilt for things that never could have been our fault? </a>
            <div class="content">Lets talk about the shame and guilt of not reporting people even though either i forgot things or didn&#x27;t know they were bad necessarily just made you feel gross. 

Like i wish i could have reported these two people (there were a few more but no confirmation that they hurt others) so that others wouldn&#x27;t have been hurt by them, its feels like i should have been stronger, remembered better/at all or said something to someone. 

Home enviroment i was always always always taught anything that happens at home stays at home and this went for others peoples houses aswell. Emotions weren&#x27;t spoken about/was told to be quiet and stop crying because things weren&#x27;t that bad and others had worse etc etc 

TW for CSA, COCSA, violence, alcohol, death, just general abusive situations from here.

Drunken violence and creepiness wasn&#x27;t talked about. Deaths weren&#x27;t spoken about. Nothing. The one time someone stood up for me was a friends mum because her older friend kept on touching/grabbing my butt/arms in view of her and my mum and he was calling it a game but my mum said nothing! It was my friends mum who&#x27;d told him to stop because it was wrong. Like i don&#x27;t understand this at all because surely its my mum who should have been protecting me! This guys used to buy me things because i was the only girl child he knew and i was &#x27;special&#x27; to him. Yeah gross m, he was in his 50s i believe and i was under 11. 

These are pretty detailed incidents so i will spoiler tag them below. 

&gt;!So between ages 8-10 there were vague instances of me and other kids being drunk and being seperated from our parents going to a different house while parents were having a house party, most of this is honestly blurry, not sure anything happened here specfically but this guy is one of the main abusers and it feels really weird. I do remember me and my mum being given massages by this guy and her thinking nothing of it, i remembered this feeling gross and like hands were running across me!&lt;

&gt;!This next bit i kind of always had some recall of, going into a room, an adult and another child/young teen in the bed with the adult and i knew what was happening but then it all goes blank them im out of the room and i feel something down below pain/numbness/weird i&#x27;m not sure and then knowing how to masturbate. I was 10 years old at this time and i used to use soft toys to do this to feel good, i did this a few times in the living room with my parents and brother in the room but i was trying to be sneaky about it/hiding it, i don&#x27;t know if it was classed as obsessive but it felt like a lot for a 10 yr old girl who&#x27;d not done anything like this before I spent that whole school year (as this happened in the summer before the next year) vommiting/gagging/being ill etc with no cause i just remember being ill a lot and like something was constantly in my mouth that needed out. This was pretty much brushed off. One of my teachers asked me if something was going on at home and i told him there wasn&#x27;t but i didn&#x27;t know really what else to say when i was used to silencing things. Then at the age of 32 i all of a sudden started getting fragments of that blank space back, i think because the person connected to this died. The blank space contained me here the other child/young teen being assaulted and then i was pushed against the wall, held there and it happened to me aswell. Then i also remember that this guys other step-daughter (not the one in the room with me) tried to take him to court for sexual abuse and her mum chose not to believe her despite us all remembering the guy saying that as soon as they were 18 he was going to have sex with them both. And the one in the room with me had been sleeping in his bed, i mean she was 13/14 at the time so probably was coerced despite probably wanting to be/act older etc.!&lt;

Now, briefly above is CSA against 3 children, two i know did happen as it was me and another i remember and 1 reported but wasn&#x27;t believed, i feel so so bad that i never said anything to support the one who attempted to report, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to my brain that i only remembered in the last 2 years this still makes me feel bad enough that that other girl wasn&#x27;t believed and i know how that feels like we probably all do. 

Theres so much shame here but also about the below one as i was older and could have said something because i remembred enough but didn&#x27;t think it was wrong between a boyfriend and girlfriend ya know ? This guy was arrested anf sent to jail for acts against other girls some who were younger than i was. Like i could/should have done more right? I should have known surely that it was wrong? 

I did post this next bit a day or so ago but it didn&#x27;t really explain what i meant whereas i feel this post does. Though im still kind of proud of myself for saying enough words to get this accross as explaining verbally has been really difficult for me. 

&gt;!so i was 13/14ish and he was probably 17 as he&#x27;d finished high school (uk high school finishes at 16) i thought it was cool to have an older boyfriend and other people didn&#x27;t think anything of it not even my parents. He was about 5&quot;11+ height wise and i was probably about 5&quot; 2 at that time and quit thin (stressed/not wanting to eat). Essentially we were on the public bus, i was on the way home from school in my uniform still. He asked me to touch his penis, i didn&#x27;t want to thought it was weird/ i was scared others would see as the bus was busy. He grabbed my hand quite tight  and made me touch him and then attempted to pull my head down by my neck because he wanted me to suck him. I didn&#x27;t want to but he was strong, i don&#x27;t visually remembered this happening but i have somatic feelings/body memories of this happening again with something in my mouth and gagging with hands around the back of my neck. (This came up because i hate people touching my neck and was attacked at work by someone grabbing my neck which has lead to panic attacks.)!&lt;

This last one i finally explained to my therapist  yesterday in a really hard session and she said that none of these could ever have been my fault. She believed me and didn&#x27;t think i was making things up or making them sound wrose than they were. And it felt better tho part of me doesn&#x27;t believe her yet because it takes me a while to process things and i struggle with dissociation aswell so it hard to think these things were real. Like it wouldn&#x27;t be so specific if it wasn&#x27;t real right? 

Oh wow sorry this is so long i was just curious why its always us that feel the guilt and shame of CSA and things similar and like things were our fault? Or was it how we were brought up. Sorry for the length! </div>

            <div class="content">It was this day last year when it happened. I was on holiday in a different country with my cousin at the time. I haven&#x27;t actually told anyone what happened and none of my family or friends know about it apart from the cousin from the holiday.

I did find while we were in the country I was so uncomfortable with the amount of men approaching us and watching us everywhere we went. We should have never went to that country when I&#x27;d heard of other girls who had been together and said they had similar experiences and felt very uncomfortable.

We had been on a boat party on one of the days and I gave my number to one of the lifeguards from the boat. I never really had any intention of meeting up with him tbh but I&#x27;m pushover and thought it would be easier to give him my number and just block him when I went home instead of being confrontational and telling him no while on the boat.

My cousin ended up talking to one of the guys friends and had wanted to meet up with him for drinks the next night but she felt too uncomfortable going on her own. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have let her meet up with him on her own either considering our phones didn&#x27;t work when we didn&#x27;t have wifi. 

So I ended up agreeing to go with her on a &#x27;double date&#x27; with the lifeguard. I ended up having a lot to drink and was very flirty with him and kissing him throughout the night. 

He kept saying he wanted to have sex with me and even drunk I knew I didn&#x27;t want to. I felt embarrassed to say no because I was a virgin and didn&#x27;t want to tell him that. Instead I kept making excuses and said I couldn&#x27;t have sex with him because I wasn&#x27;t leaving my cousin and that I was going to be going back to the hotel with her. 

When we were all walking back to the hotel at the end of the night I remember still flirting with him and he stopped in the street and started kissing me. He said he wanted to fuck me and at that point I pulled away and said I couldn&#x27;t, but my cousin and the other guy had disappeared from the street. I didn&#x27;t know the way back to the hotel and he agreed to walk with me but I kind of knew we weren&#x27;t going the right way and didn&#x27;t say anything.

We ended up near the beach and he pulled me into a hut. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t just run away at this point. I had to know what was going to happened next but I think I convinced myself that it wouldn&#x27;t and that I could probably convince him just to have a blowjob instead. 

I remember in the hut saying I didn&#x27;t want to do this and that I wanted to go to the hotel. And I can&#x27;t really remember exactly how it happened but I remember him trying to get his dick inside me and it being agony and shouting for him to stop. It&#x27;s that part that confuses me looking back because he did stop after I told him to so I don&#x27;t even think that counts as rape. But then he bent me over and started anal and it was awful too and I remember begging him to stop and he told me to be quiet and I think I heard people walking past. 

I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t shout out to them or fight back or just say no I don&#x27;t want to have sex, in the first place. I hate the fact that I made excuses on why I couldn&#x27;t have sex instead of just telling the truth ans saying I didn&#x27;t want to. 

I hate everything about that night. I hate myself for even going out that night, I feel like I brought it on myself because I knew from earlier that night he wanted to have sex and I shouldn&#x27;t have let myself be along with him.

I hate my cousin&#x27;s reaction to it all after when she found me on the beach. I hate that she told me it was my fault and that her opinion is the same as mine because I know of the situation was reversed I would never think it was her fault. </div>

            <div class="content">I’m a 36 year old man, who is married to my 35 year old wife Sara. This happened at my best friend’s bachelor party and my wife Sara still doesn’t know about it. It’s something I’ve kept from her to protect her feelings during what she describes as the most difficult time in her entire life. What she doesn’t know is that during this time it was also my most difficult time, for reasons she still doesn’t know. My last night in Miami, at the tail end of this bachelor party weekend, I was raped by a man named Carlos. I will detail this more later.

The more time that passes, the more difficult it is for me and the opportunity to bring it up only gets narrower. The subject of the Miami trip rears it’s ugly head at least 3 times a year. With it comes anger, shaming, tears, and leaves us both gutted. Each one of these episodes breaks her heart as well as mine, all over again. Sara and I are both bisexual and we both had established that either of us could explore our sexualities as long as we ended up telling the other person about it afterwards and to “not waste an opportunity by making sure it’s ok”. Other agreements were to make sure we’re safe about it and this only applied to same sex encounters.



When my best friend had his bachelor party in Miami, I had my first opportunity to fool around with another guy. His name was Logan who was a friend of my bachelor best friend Dylan, though i didn’t know him very well. Logan is gay, but not really my type. Certain sets of circumstances had to happen the way they did for it to ever be a possibility, which is what happened. When I told my wife about it, she was crushed.



My continued position on the subject of Logan is that I didn’t stray beyond established relationship boundaries. My faults are rooted in the aftermath, where her reaction wasn’t what either of us expected. Instead of comforting her for her justifiable emotions, I went on the defensive. While I have acknowledged that my lack of empathy during the aftermath was 100% wrong, I feel that to this day, now 8 years later, she has not acknowledged that my actual sexual interactions with Logan were not outside of our previously agreed upon boundaries. I am still to this day labeled a cheater, and am left with the feeling that all trust relating towards my faithfulness to her has been lost. She now fears that I have cheated on her other times, or that I will again, which I haven’t and would never. It is for this reason, and others that I haven’t told her about what happened with Carlos. Her initial reaction to what happened between Logan and I immediately put the Carlos discussion on the back burner, where it has sat for 8 years. I’ve tried to find a good time to tell her about it, and the temptation to tell her when the Miami argument rears it’s ugly head is pretty powerful. I want to deflect the conversation towards my own trauma, I guess to get sympathy, but I also feel like this secret of mine explains so much of my emotions, lack of empathy, anger, and actions during the initial aftermath. That wouldn’t be fair and I don’t think I’d get the reaction I want. It’s something I try not to think about. My wife and I are reminded of the subject if Miami is brought up. Even if it’s something as simple as the Miami Dolphins, or the movie Scarface. The issue is Sara thinks these “Miami” triggers only impact her. That I had this great time there and cheated on her. What she doesn’t realize is that I don’t want to talk or think about it either, for reasons unknown to her. For reasons I want to forget, but can’t. My biggest fear about telling her about this painful and dark event in my past is that she will react with anger. I want and need her to be supportive and loving if/when she finally finds out.  A reaction of anger from her on this subject would be the most devastating moment of my life and I don’t know how I would react... but it would be self destructive, for sure.



Here are the events of what happened with Carlos to the best of my recollection. WARNING, the following is a detailed description of what happened. I find that providing as much details as possible helps me to better work through struggles and its an exercise I do with a lot of difficult obstacles in my life. I will give an up front TLDR here for those that don’t want to read the details. TLDR: Carlos was jealous that I fooled around with Logan and wanted him and I to fool around also, but didn’t take no for an answer. He took advantage of me in a compromising position, where he held me down and forcefully raped my mouth. In my paralysis I went from resisting as best I could to just taking it, waiting for it to end. He then gave me oral, which was not enjoyable, but biology overrode my paralyzing fear and I ejaculated, causing an immediate panic attack. 



At the time of this, I hadn’t slept in at least 24 hours, was half a day removed from coming down off of MDMA, had been day drinking, and was now trying to stay awake so that I could catch a 3am cab ride to the airport. Everyone had passed out from the weekend activities, and were getting rest for their own trips home the next day. I was the only one leaving at such an early hour. Carlos said he’d stay up with me and help keep me awake. We ended up going on a walk to some pier. Along the way we just talked. Casual conversations, get to know you type stuff, as we really didn’t know each other very well. The subject shifted to my sexuality, the events that transpired between Logan and I, my relationship with Sara, then weird stuff like how he’s slept with over 200 women in his life, but he’s gay. Essentially trying to convince me that I’m just gay, is what it felt like. Another example of bi erasure, invalidating my sexuality based only on his journey, but whatever. He propositioned me once we got to the pier. At this point it was somewhere around midnight and there was nobody around. I declined his advances. He seemed frustrated that I could fool around with Logan, but not him. Honestly neither of them are my type. A combination of mdma and the fact that Logan and I were forced to share a bed due to limited space in the air BNB was really the catalyst. In any other scenario I would never seek him out. Carlos was a lot older than me. I was 28 and I want to say he was 40. For context, Logan was 29, maybe 30. There’s also nothing attractive about someone who brags about the 200 plus women he’s slept with. Who knows what his number is for men. The subject ended, or at least I thought it did as we walked back to the house from the pier. I don’t remember what conversations were had on the walk back, if any.



Once we got back, I went in the house and made sure all my stuff was packed, called a cab service and scheduled a 3 am pickup. I went back outside for a smoke where I found Carlos sitting at the outdoor table that had been everyone’s hangout base all weekend. I sat at the table with him, where we both smoked and talked. The subject of us fooling around came up again, which I again declined. He was much more pushy this time, saying things like “I just don’t understand why you don’t want to fool around. I’m very experienced. I’ll give you the best blow job of your entire life... I’m really good at it...etc” At this point I was getting noticeably irritated by his continued propositions. My previous rejections were friendly, but as he continued and was now moving his chair uncomfortably close to mine, I became more forceful with “No Carlos. I am not interested.” With that he reached his hand over and grabbed my penis, over my jeans and began rubbing it. I quickly pushed his hand away and attempted to stand up out of my chair. He grabbed my shoulders and sat me back in my chair. ‘Sit your ass back down.” He said, keeping one hand on me which had moved from my shoulder to around the side of my neck, where he tightened his grip enough to effect my breathing. He went back to work with his hand on the outside of my jeans and his grip around my neck eased a little as I didn’t fight back. I was frozen in fear, I wasn’t turned on at all. Just 100% flaccid. I had hoped that my lack of excitement would send the message that I wasn’t interested, but i think it just frustrated him more. After a minute or so I snapped out of it and told him to stop. He looked up at me, still holding my neck with one hand and grabbed the hair on the back of my head with his other hand and stood up. He then released my neck, still holding onto my hair, used his free hand to pull down his pants, revealing his fully erect penis. “C’mon, suck this big dick.” He said, pushing his penis against my face which I was trying my best to turn away from. Eventually he breached my lips and I let up, opening my mouth for him. I figured at this point it wasn’t going to just end, I guess. With is hand holding my hair still, he proceeded to thrust his penis very forcefully in my mouth, hitting the back of my throat, causing me to gag and cough. He eased up after this and slowed and shortened his thrusts. I just sat there with my mouth open, no sucking or tongue action... just taking it in, hoping it would end soon and praying that I wasn’t going to get AIDS or something. He eventually stopped and told me it was my turn. He released me from his grip but was still standing over the chair. Again I was just frozen. He quickly pulled my jeans and underwear down to my knees, revealing my still flaccid penis. As quickly as he took my pants off he got down and put my penis in his mouth. With my head free, I’m now looking at my surroundings. There is nobody in sight. I just kind of sit there, arms folded across my chest, hoping that he loses interest as my penis isn’t getting any less flaccid. He doesn’t lose interest and keeps going. Eventually I start to feel my penis get hard and I’m mortified by this. It snaps me out of it for a moment, where I again tell him to stop, but he doesn’t. It was the strangest erection of my life. I was hard, but didn’t grow in size. So here I am getting a forced blowjob on my now erect penis that I don’t even recognize, with how small it looks. At this point I just decide to 100% let go. Let him finish, close your eyes, think about something sexy, and just try to cum. It took a while, but Carlos was determined, taking breaks by standing up and forcing his penis back in my mouth, which I was less resistant towards, in that I opened my mouth for him this time, but my lack of enthusiasm should have been an indicator to anyone that this was not consensual. I just wanted it over and figured cooperation would expedite the process, since nothing short of screaming or getting physical would stop it. Something I felt powerless to do, given the circumstances of having to be in a wedding with this guy in just a couple of days, for my best friend’s wedding (I was the best man and Carlos was a groomsman). Eventually he made me cum, which ended up spilling out of his mouth, all over the front of my jeans. The release caused an immediate panic attack. I forcefully shoved him away, was hyperventilating, and I told him my cab was here. I could tell he realized what had just happened because he was suddenly concerned for me. “Are you ok?” “Need a hand with any of your luggage?” “No.” I said. I ran and grabbed my stuff and sat on the curb out front, which had no line of sight from the house because of bushes that were in the yard. I waited there until the cab arrived. I sat there crying as I waited 20 or so minutes for the cab. 

I hadn’t even cleaned the cum off of my clothes. It wasn’t until I got to the airport that I went into a bathroom stall, cleaned the cum off of my clothes, brushed my teeth, and eventually had to just change clothes. I passed out at my gate and was woken up by someone working the ticket counter because the plane was fully boarded and it was about to leave. I got on the plane, got to my seat and just passed out on my tray table the entire flight. Was woken up by the sound and jolt of the landing. Got off the plane, met up with Sara who was picking me up at the airport, told her about Logan, and the rest is regrettable history. I never told her about Carlos. I was going to, but just couldn’t after her reaction to the Logan situation... especially since we were going to a wedding where Carlos would be. I wasn’t protecting Carlos, I was protecting my best friend Dylan, as well as Sara’s fragile and raw emotions. I had planned to tell her after the wedding, but just never could. Our relationship was on the rockiest of grounds at that time and I wasn’t going to add more fuel to the fire. I hadn’t even had a chance to come to terms with what had happened at that point either. I had intentionally buried it away, until this goddamn wedding was over. The wedding ended. Her seeing Logan at the wedding did me know favors, and the next 6 months were haunted with weekly fights and arguments, fueled by her jealousy, and my secret trauma. 



Now 8 years later, the topic of Miami enters her mind and suddenly I am put back on trial for something that I thought we had moved past. I have always felt that what happened between Logan and I was the result of a communication breakdown between Sara and I and she has acknowledged that on occasion. When the subject rears its ugly head after a 6 month hiatus, its like we’re back to square one, where all the miscommunications we previously established, my endless apologies for being defensive in the immediate aftermath… all of those late night arguments, talks, working through this issue were seemingly for nothing, because her grievances to this very day contradict what we had already worked through. As the subject continues to come up over the years, I find myself tempted to tell her about Carlos. I personally feel like its a missing piece to the puzzle that might explain my actions and feelings on the subject. It took me years to get through what happened to me and I’m in a much better place about it than I used to, but each time Sara brings up the subject I go quiet, with nothing to say. Part of it is the frustration of, “this again?” but I’m also being reminded of Carlos and what he did to me. Something that I’ve worked through well enough that it’s rare for me to even think about, but I’m forced to when this subject emerges. I feel like my reasons to tell Sara may be  selfish. The reasons stem from self preservation, it feels like a deflection, and I worry that from her perspective that this new information would pressure Sara into simply getting over something for the sake of my feelings. On the other hand, the biggest grievance of hers on the subject seems to be the immediate aftermath. My being overly defensive, angry, not being supportive of her emotions, and being distant. These reactions of mine would have been completely different if I hadn’t been raped, so in many ways I feel like this information would at least put my actions into a clearer context.



I should add that our lives are so much different now than they were back then. When this all happened we had been dating for years. We are now married and have two kids. Our lives have been difficult, just like everyone else the last 3 years and bringing this issue into our already hectic life feels worse than it did 5 years ago. For me our priorities are to our children, our love for each other, and just getting through the chaos we’re all living through right now. This issue just feels so insignificant to me at this point in our lives and I wish she could understand that there’s a huge difference between the people we were 8 years ago and today.



**TLDR:** Fooled around with another guy at friend’s bachelor party. My wife (girlfriend at the time) was devastated when I told her about it, even though it was within out already established boundaries as a bisexual couple. Another guy at the bachelor party was jealous and raped me, which I never told my wife about, because I always felt like it would just add fuel to the fire. Now 8 years later I am still reminded by my wife about how shitty it was for me to cheat on her and how I put her through hell, all while she has no idea of my own personal hell that I’ve had to go through alone, all these years. I need to move past my own trauma, but can’t when I’m being frequently reminded of a weekend in 2015 that I wish I could simply forget.



Do I tell Sara about what happened? If so, what is the appropriate time and place to tell her? What do you think her reaction to this should be? What should I be prepared for if I tell her? 



Thank you so much in advance. Any advise on this is appreciated, beyond words. It’s been eating away at me for years and I’m getting to the point where I can’t hold it to myself any more. I just want to make sure I approach this the best way possible, for her.</div>

            <div class="content">First and foremost I never use Reddit, but I am tired of losing sleep and don&#x27;t really know where else/who to rant to. Also, because there wasn&#x27;t an option to add this, this is a trigger warning that a minor was involved.

When I was around 16 and freshly 17, I had started talking to this senior (18 or 19?) while I was a junior. I only really started talking to him because he gave me attention, I had self-esteem issues, and I was trying to move on from having feelings for one of my closest friends. He knew I had self-esteem issues and would give me compliments, even though some were weird like &quot;I&#x27;d n\*t on your face&quot;, but again it was the first time a guy who wasn&#x27;t unattractive showed interest. He would also pressure me into sending suggestive images, even knowing I didn&#x27;t enjoy it. He even used the fact that he would never screenshot or save them as a reason for me to trust him and he would always make sure to tell me that he did intend to pursue a relationship and that it wasn&#x27;t solely for sex.

Anyways, as per the incident, we were just going to hang out in his car. He picked me up pretty late at night, and immediately drove to our town lake, making sure there was no one around. We talked for a bit and suggested moving to the back, to which I agreed. He asked to make out, which was the only part he asked about because he was curious if it was my first. It was and I did consent. After that, he removed my shirt and bra and began fondling my breasts, both orally and with his hands. Honestly, all I could remember thinking was when it would end, because at the time in my mind I was just bored. He then proceeded to take out his penis and told me to give him a bj and took off my jeans as well. It wasn&#x27;t aggressive, which is why things are so blurry for me. However, I know he never asked and I was in a dark parking lot in the middle of the night, I guess that was his way of telling me I didn&#x27;t have a choice. I did what he asked, again this was my first time being with a guy. I just remember him making comments on my body the whole time and even tried to finger me, which just felt so uncomfortable because I was so unbelievably unaroused. He just thought it was because I was a virgin, which he seemed to be satisfied with. We only stopped because my mom kept calling me and he got irritated and dropped me off without saying a word. Afterward, I didn&#x27;t think much of it and had even told my friends about this &quot;sneaky link&quot;.

This happened spring break before the pandemic, so I had never been with another guy since. However, now I&#x27;m in my freshman year of college and have felt left out when it comes to dating. I even downloaded Tinder and went on a few dates. These memories and conflicted feelings started recurring because after going on a date with a guy I really liked, he tried to kiss me in his car and I freaked out (he was respectful and we were parked outside of the restaurant, so I acknowledge the situations are not comparable). After this, a prank was pulled on me that made me believe a guy I knew was weird knew where I lived. Also, one of my friends would randomly call me &quot;97%&quot; as a &quot;playful jab&quot;. These incidents are what finally made me question whether I was sexually assaulted or if I can even claim to be (was I just coerced, pressured? manipulated?). I&#x27;ve lost some sleep that has affected my performance in school and it was the first time I had cried since coming to college. I hate that this is getting in the way of my life, but I&#x27;m not sure I can even be intimate with a guy, which sucks because I do genuinely want to be in a relationship and sex is just unavoidable. I get that not everyone is like that but I hate that it&#x27;s a barrier, especially as a 19-year-old. I can&#x27;t even make out with someone unless I am drunk and at a party surrounded by people. God, I even dread the possibility of having to have this conversation with every future partner I have. I apologize if this is just a rant, but I needed to get it out, and thank you if you made it this far. I just don&#x27;t know where to go from here, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m too harsh on myself, or if I&#x27;m just exaggerating something, but yeah it took me 2 years to even contemplate what happened and accept it (honestly not sure I have). I just would like to move on and have a normal life.</div>

            <div class="content">I hate that I am still thinking and caring about this after 3 years. I think that most of the time I am feeling better, gradually moving on and healing from this experience, but then I get triggered and I am disappointed to find out how easily I begin obsessing over this again. This is the first time I’ve tried to write about it in a while, because I got sick of trying to articulate myself, only to make myself angry and frustrated. I am aware how petty all of this sounds when I try to put it into words, but I am beginning to suspect that even worse is not writing about it and instead spinning it around in my head and still getting angry and frustrated. 

This is regarding friend group drama, mainly concerning my former best girlfriends (Christine and Ashley), my former friend group (The Group), a current close girl friend/college roommate (Julie) who is friends with my former friends, a “Queen Bee” type girl who I don’t think was ever my friend (Mary), my fiance (David) and the breakup from hell. All names are changed, of course. Writing to help digest this a little more and maybe get some insight or support from anyone who has been through something similar. 

A few weeks ago, my friend Liz told me she wanted to go dancing. I invited my good friend Julie and told her to pick the date, since she works nights/weekends frequently. We picked a date a couple of weeks out, and I invited a few more people — Rachael, Kyle etc. 

A couple of days before our dance night date, Julie sent me a text letting me know that “The Group” is planning to go dancing at the same place the same night. I feel like I always run the risk of running into The Group when going dancing in our neighborhood. I think it is they who care more deeply about running into me. The usual thing that happens when I run into “The Group” is they get upset and leave. If anything, I felt Julie should be telling them that “FYI, throwawaygirldrama and I already have plans to go dancing there that night.” She probably did mention something similar to them, which makes what ended up happening that night was even more messed up.

Saturday comes along and I text my girls inviting anyone who wants to, to come get ready/pre-game at my place. Julie responded that she would be “party-hopping” and she would text me later in the night to see where I was at. I had decoded this to mean that she was pre-gaming w/The Group instead. Liz got sick and had to cancel. Rachael came over early. Shortly before we left, Julie told us to let her know when we were leaving and she’d meet us there. I decoded this to mean that she was walking over from Mary’s, since she lives near the club we were all going to. I shot her a text when we were on our way, about 10 min later. When Rachael and I arrived, we saw The Group right away, and they saw us, but I didn’t see Julie. Rachael and I walked to the upper bar to check there, which is where we found Kyle, but no Julie. We hung out upstairs for a while, then went back to the first level to look again. A few more of my friends show up. We hit the dance floor, giving The Group plenty of space to do their own thang. I did my best to ignore the annoying sting of rejection I still get watching my former besties dance with each other. I started to get a little concerned that Julie hadn’t shown up. Maybe I had been wrong to assume that she was coming from Mary’s? I would’ve felt like a dick if that were true.

I kept scanning the club and texted her a couple of times throughout the night. About an hour and twenty minutes after we were supposed to meet, Julie texted me apologizing, saying she had fallen asleep and would be right over. A few minutes later, a flustered and upset Julie walks into the club saying she had no idea what happened and she just “lost” the last few hours of her night. At this moment, Mary comes up to both of us and says to me, “Oh hey! I was about to come over to tell you that Julie was asleep at my place, and for you not to worry!” Julie kept repeating, sounding a little upset, “What the fuck happened?” Mary told Julie that she was just drunk and this is what happens when you smoke weed for the first time in years. I assumed that Julie was a little uncomfortable because, well, I kind of had a right to be a little annoyed with her. I tried to downplay the situation as best I could, showing Julie I wasn’t going to be pissed at her in that moment, and I just wanted her to dance and have a good time now that she was there. I brought Julie over to where I had been dancing, near the back of the room, away from The Group, who was near the front of the room. She asked where everyone was and I told her I’d show her/check out the scene/bring the rest of my crew if the vibe was good. We danced our way up to the front of the room. I was actually pretty thrilled to evaluate the lack of hostility toward me when I danced up with her. I even got chi from Christine. After a few minutes, I go to the back of the room to grab the rest of our crew so Julie can dance with all of us and maybe we can dissolve this conflict by another few millimeters. 

Instead, after about 10 minutes, the entire Group quickly and discreetly left the dance floor. When Julie noticed this she looked at me and mouthed, “what the fuck?” and I kind of shrugged like, “welcome to the last three years of my life.” She says, “Did they leave??! My stuff is still at their place!” I volunteered to help her look around the club, and sure enough, they had left. Julie, still appearing very inebriated and lethargic said she had to at least go back and grab her stuff and that she would be right back. I volunteered to walk with her, because I wasn’t immediately comfortable with her walking by herself. She was insistent that I not, which I think was mostly b/c Mary would’ve been pissed if I walked to her house, so I hesitantly agreed to let her walk the short distance back alone. 

A few minutes later Julie texted me that she was getting an uber home and that the whole night was “so fucked up”. I continued dancing/hanging with my friends the rest of the night and through the wee hours of the morning, but the whole situation was very triggering. 

I have felt for years that Mary has been trying to alienate me from my friends, and has been using her friendship with Julie to hurt me. I didn’t dare dream to tell Julie, because I didn’t want to be a huge bitch. Julie was my college roommate and has been one of my best friends for 10 years, and she was 1 of only 2 girlfriends I had left after The Group banished me 3 years ago. I thought it was a little fishy that Mary started including Julie aggressively the exact same time I was being exiled. By the way, the other girlfriend I had left (Ashley) also coincidentally became one of Mary’s bffs around the same time, and she and I are no longer friends. I don’t think I am a bitch for noticing the correlation.

But it definitely would have made me sound like a bitch to say it to Julie. I know this, because I tried to say it to Ashley and it didn’t go well. I had confronted her pretty early on, explaining that I felt like our vibe had gotten funky. She caved and told me that Mary mentioned it was weird that Ashley let David and I stay with her when he and I first got together, since David used to be in love with Ashley, and so now Ashley and her boyfriend felt awkward around me knowing that David used to be in love with her. SO MUCH what the fuck in that one statement. I told her that it sounded like Mary was trying to keep this conflict ignited. That was the last time she and I spoke for years. 

David, by the way, is now my fiancé. We were friends for 5 years before figuring out we were in love. I think he’s the bee’s knees. He’s my favorite human in the world and we went through hell when we discovered we were in love, and I would do it again if I had to. Totally worth it. David feels the same way about me. He lost everything when we fell in love 3 years ago, including all of his friends, his job, his roommates evicted him - and we still think the other is hot shit. The Group freaked out when we kissed, because it happened the night before I broke up with my crazy af ex-boyfriend, who most of these friends had complained to/warned me about before we broke up, with the one exception of Roger - my ex’s bff since 3rd grade. And even though he would apologize 6 months later, Roger had an enraged and childish reaction initially, and then everyone who had ever experienced any sort of relationship trauma joined the bandwagon in projecting it onto my situation. My multidimensional private life = black and white “cheating” and betrayal to The Group in their eyes. They expressed their suspicion that maybe David and I had lied to them about what happened, because I had told Christine that I had made out with David and OMFG, and David had been ambiguous when telling the guys, which apparently meant we fucked. Therefore, one of us was lying, which meant we were giant lying adulterers, never to be trusted or forgiven or even allowed to speak their side of things. After 5 years of an otherwise, extremely close and trusting friendship, Christine stopped speaking to me almost overnight, and we haven’t spoken about it since. This collective judgmental and self-absorbed reaction totally steamrolled my heart.  

By the way - I don’t even think that this is how my friends actually felt about my or David’s character. I think that Roger had an emotional reaction and everyone else was scared that people were fighting, and far more people enjoyed being on a high horse for a while, rather than to speak the mighty unpopular, “let’s not jump to any conclusions about the personal lives of the people we love.” Or at least, they valued the belonging The Group provided more than they valued my or David’s individual friendships, which is also crushing. This was a particularly hard reality to face when it came to my best girls, Christine and Ashley, because I really did feel safe in those friendships up to that point. 

Now there is too much pride to acknowledge that these friends annihilated the personal boundaries of our friendships by exploiting what David and and I had volunteered to our friends in confidence, and twisting it into a personal assault on these friendships. There is also too much pride to admit that the people “most angry” about what David and I did are not those closest to my ex, but rather those closest to Mary.

Also worth mentioning: aside from Roger, no one in The Group is friends with my ex, who immediately followed up our breakup with a swift and affective PR campaign spreading the news that I had had a “mental breakdown” and had an “affair” right before my oh-so-perfect boyfriend was planning to propose (so many levels of false). After breaking up with him, in the time it took me to drive the .4 miles to Christine’s, he had already called my family members and closest girlfriends, alarming them with his narrative. The next few days he branched further out, contacting via Facebook my out-of-state high school and college friends who he had never met, and my professional/industry contacts. He would figure out where I was staying and get in touch with anyone that put me up, letting them know “what happened,” and he did all of this under the guise of “concern.” F that guy.

I found myself immediately isolated, and pissed as hell, but felt I wasn’t permitted to express any anger, since, after all, I was the one who technically “cheated.” I just had to take my lumps, and I was ready to do that. In fact, I told my friends that I understood if they couldn’t align with me at that moment, and that I hoped we could reconnect later. In the weeks that followed, the few Group events I had been invited to before all this happened, I was uninvited to by Mary, who explained to me time and time again that she was the “Group Mom” and that everyone really needs to be there for my ex and Roger right now and if only I had done things a different way, they could support me instead. Did I mention that Mary most especially didn’t like Max before all this happened? Did I mention none of these people were friends with him not even a year later? 

My only two girlfriends left were Julie and Ashley.

After a while, David and I went on a 4 month road trip for a reprieve from the humiliation of our best friends shaming/icing us out publicly, repeatedly, and to give space as an attempt to let The Group “heal” from this very upsetting thing that had happened to ~~us~~ them. During that time, Ashley, as I mentioned, became one of Mary’s bffs, and Julie too, was adopted into The Group’s A-Team - suddenly at every social event that Mary planned, and even living in Mary’s house for a period of time, and I did my best to contain my rage and jealousy, otherwise I risked losing Julie too. 

Eventually, David and I made new friends and began to forge a new community. My new girlfriends are really incredible women and I am ultimately really grateful all of this happened. I feel valued, appreciated and safe enough to be vulnerable in these friendships, and I have put a LOT of energy into nurturing these new relationships because I also suffer from depression, and having a loving community is really important to me for managing it. The hard part is, because we have all come up in the city together for close to 10 years, our communities are still very intertwined. I’m still friends with people, aside from Julie, who are included by The Group (aka Queen Mary), and it has put a weird ingredient into all of these remaining friendships. My strategy hasn’t changed. I show up to everything I’m invited to, ready to give space if I feel someone is avoiding me, or give chi if someone looks like they want reconcile. For the first two years, every time there was a birthday party or an event that David and I had RSVP’d to, The Group would outright refuse to attend, or would leave as soon as we arrived. Once, we were even uninvited to a party after someone from The Group told the host that if we came, no one from The Group would go. This host sent an unprompted apology about a year and a half later, but it was massively hurtful when that originally went down, and it was another friendship lost to this situation.

In the past 3 or 4 months, there has been a slight improvement regarding my relationship with The Group. Julie had her 30th Birthday party in June and told everyone she wanted ALL of her friends there. No drama, etc. Everyone came and danced. Ashley made first contact with me in years, congratulating me on my engagement. Christine made first eye contact with me in years, and even gave me a smile from across the dance floor. Mary approached me for the first time in a couple of years and leading with, “I’m not mean,” immediately attempted to explain to me, again, how difficult of a position I put her in 3 years ago with the untimely discovery of the love of my life, and she’s the “Group Mom” and bla bla bla, and i was like, “Girl - if you wanna work this out, I don’t want to hear the same stuff you said 3 years ago.”

There was a bbq we were all invited to a few weeks later that, while we didn’t make contact with one another, there was hanging out near each other, allowing all our uninvolved friends to have all their friends in one place, which was a huge step forward. A few weeks later, there was an engagement party where again, everyone was civil. Yay - I consider that 3 wins in a relatively short period of time.

Then this past weekend happened. The main thing that this has made me realize is even though I’ve been trying to be cool, I am still pissed at at my former girlfriends, and I’m annoyed to find how much I still care about this even though I know that (aside from Julie) these girls really don’t care about me or like me and I shouldn’t care about them. I do still care and I’m still really hurt. I’m not attracted to their behavior, how they treated me, how they treated Julie this past weekend, but I also can’t seem to stop fantasizing about some sort of closure. The way things ended with them was actually pretty traumatic,  and it has taken a lot of effort to not let this experience obliterate my self-esteem. I have tried to reach out to Christine, Ashley, and even Mary in the past, and none of those interactions provided any understanding for what I had been experiencing, and so I backed off, and have been left to work out these feelings myself. 

Julie has been a witness to a lot of what I have been through, and supports me but continues to hang out with The Group and considers them to be her friends. I don’t totally blame her. Even though I think that Mary is manipulating the situation, I still love a lot of people that are in her good graces, and the get togethers are fun and I truthfully, I hate that I’m excluded. I have done my best to be sensitive to Julie’s position in this situation, but at this point, I don’t feel like the same level of courtesy is being reciprocate. I don’t say anything when I see her posts of weekends away on adventures with The Group, even though I still feel rejected and left out. But she and I had a date for weeks, and instead of coming out with me, she chose to go out with them, and I feel that Mary took advantage of that. A part of me really wanted to believe that if The Group knew I was meeting up with Julie at the same club, and they still wanted to go, then maybe there was intent to hang out together and continue with our forward progress. But instead, they knew she was supposed to meet me that night, and they left without her, not even waking her to tell her they were leaving. 

Mary didn’t tell me Julie was safely sleeping at her place when I first walked in and saw all of them at the bar without her, or when we were all on the dance floor. It only occurred to Mary to tell me not to worry after Julie had already walked in the door 90 minutes late.  

On the dance floor, I was wiling to let it all slide because I hadn’t yet put it together that maybe Mary left her intentionally, and I was excited that I was getting positive chi from Christine. But 10 minutes later, I found myself humiliated by my optimistic assumptions, when the whole group was suddenly gone, ditching Julie for the 2nd time in 2 hours. Julie goes home. I stay and dance with my other friends. In spite of having a great time with my new buds, I begin to obsessively dissect this situation for the thousandth time in 3 years.

I know that Julie and I need to talk about this, and we will. We love each other very much and I know that while this is an annoyance in our friendships and she and I will outlive it. What bothers me more is how much I still care about being rejected by my old girlfriends, and how I feel like there’s not much I can really do about it. I thought that by now, with new friends, this wound would be gone. I feel foolish for assuming there can be peace between us, and I don’t know what different actions to take to expedite building this peace within myself. I’m hoping that writing today will help dissolve the need for my brain to chew on this conflict until I’m red in the face, and maybe through writing I can eventually get to a new place with it. I guess that this injury just runs deep and I need to be patient - after enough time has passed I will feel nothing when we all run into each other, but that’s just not how I feel yet.</div>

            <div class="content">TL:DR: the ongoing saga of me and my lovely(cue sarcasm) ex husband

I guess I could say that part of this whole thing is my fault. After all, I did marry him very young (19), very quickly (one month of dating), and we had our first child almost immediately(we married in March, she was born in 
November). I think the whole reason for marrying him young and fast was that I had just finished Navy boot camp and I was in a new state all by myself and didn&#x27;t know anybody. My first steady boyfriend had broken up with me a
few months before I shipped out and I still missed him quite a bit(we were together on and off all through high-school). My ex husband (we&#x27;ll call him Dick) was the first guy to be nice to me, and I guess I kind of latched on
to him. I didn&#x27;t really have any experience with dating, having lived a sheltered life with my grandmother from age 11.

Anyway, things were nice at first(by at first I mean, the first few months we were married). We got along great. However, I slowly started noticing who he really was. I think I was a few months pregnant when we started arguing. 
I didn&#x27;t think much of that though, you know, with me being naive and all. We never really had much time to ourselves, because he always had friends over, and they were always drinking. When we weren&#x27;t at home with his friends, we
were both going to &quot;A&quot; School for our prospective jobs in the military, and then working eight hours a day all week. My aunt and grandmother visited when I was about seven months pregnant, and even she(my aunt) noticed that something 
wasn&#x27;t right. Of course, she didn&#x27;t think it was her place to say anything to me about it at the time. And with me being in the military, there really wasn&#x27;t much they could have done anyway because I had only just started my 
enlistment. 

He got to the point(while I was still pregnant) where he would pick on me about little things (he yelled at me for accidentally leaving my purse in a shopping cart), he would talk to other girls online and act like he wasn&#x27;t 
married, or he would tell the girl he was talking to that we were having problems(red flags, I know, but again, I was young and naive). He even laughed at me when I threw up all over my desk at work after I&#x27;d drank too much water
prior to an ultrasound. I blamed it all on being pregnant and hormones. What really aggravated me was when I went to my final prenatal appointment(alone, mind you), and they said I was already dilating and they said they were
going to induce me. I called him, and he had the audacity to complain that he was working on his car, when I told him that he needed to pick me up so I could pack and be brought back to be admitted to the hospital. 

Things were okay for a while when we brought our first daughter home, but of course things didn&#x27;t last. Even though we were parents now, he still wanted to be out and about and have his friends over. He even had somebody watch
our daughter when she was just a few months old so we could go to Mardi Gras(I was only 20 at the time, so I couldn&#x27;t drink anyway). That night consisted of him getting wasted on Hand Grenades, groping other women(he 
thought this was okay because after all, it was Mardi Gras), him bitching at me because I forgot my ID back in Florida(not that it mattered much anyway), us fighting, and him eventually leaving me by myself, with one of his 
friends so he could go into the bars and drink some more. I didn&#x27;t see him until the following morning, at our hotel.

He would even have loud parties at our apartment. One Friday night, before I was due to be at my job on Saturday morning at the armory for a watch, he had the music blasting, and he passed our infant daughter around to everyone, 
until I got pissed and put her to bed. I then asked him to turn the music down because I needed to sleep, and he flat-out ignored me. What made this worse was, they were playing the same song repeatedly. So I ended up having to go 
to work on almost no sleep.

Eventually, he got new orders to go to Flight Engineer School in Jacksonville, and I had to stay behind in Pensacola until my orders ran out. He barely came to see me in that time, always saying that he was busy with school work
and whatnot. I eventually got new orders to do some AO work at NAS Jacksonville on P-3s. This is when things really started going shitty. I ended up having to do an overnight job at a buoy locker, and it pissed him off. He 
ended up making me move into barracks so I wouldn&#x27;t inconvenience him. Of course that ended up backfiring on him because it came to the CO&#x27;s attention, and he made Dick let me back into my own house( I don&#x27;t remember all the details
of this part because it was fourteen years, and it&#x27;s something I choose to forget). This was also the first time he cheated on me. He met up with a girl at a parking lot.

He got in trouble with the military a few times at this point. I don&#x27;t exactly remember what the first time was for, but he ended up having to go to the brig for a few weeks. I had just gotten pregnant for the second time, but due
to the stress I was going through with him being away, and me having issues with my own admin job that I&#x27;d just changed to, ended up miscarrying. I moved to one more job adding amendments to Naval publications or some such thing.
The next time he got in trouble with the military, he ended up popping for drugs, which as a lot of you probably know, results in being dishonorably discharged. So, given that he was kicked out, he didn&#x27;t really give a shit about
the military anymore, which led him to shutting off the alarm clock, and me waking up almost two hours late for work. Needless to say, I was written up, and in a ton of trouble. I got home that day, pissed off, to a drunk husband, 
who immediately started bossing me around. It got to the point where I was so fed up, that I screamed at him to do it himself. He ended up chasing me out of the house, and when I went back in to get my daughter, he took her away
from me and pushed me down. I ended up calling the cops on him because he wasn&#x27;t letting me get to my daughter and he was arrested. He was issued a restraining order. 

After this, we were both kicked out of the military (mine was a general discharge under honorable conditions). There was some other crap with social services doing an investigation into the well-being of our daughter, because Of 
our stupid, nosy neighbor, so even though I wanted to move the hell out of Florida and back to New York, I couldn&#x27;t do anything, until they were done. We ended up having to move out of our house and into a trailer park in the 
downtown Jacksonville area, near the mall. He ended up being arrested by NCIS because a laptop which had been stolen from our house, had confidential Naval documents on it. I have no idea why he was stupid enough to put stuff 
like that on a laptop, but, that&#x27;s Dick for you. So I was in a trailer, with no money, trying to take care of our daughter, while he was serving whatever time they gave him. The only reason we didn&#x27;t starve or end up homeless is 
because his former best friend that was living with us to help take care of our daughter,while we were working, found a job and helped support us(He and I are still friends to this day).

Eventually, the investigation into our daughter&#x27;s well-being closed, and I was free to leave, so I moved back to NY while Dick was still in the brig. He ended up following suit when he got out and found work as a used-car 
salesman. I got pregnant with our other daughter in June. From then up until her birth, we fought, he moved out and then back in again (I know, definition of insanity and all that. I think I just really wanted to make things 
work for the sake of the kids). We ended up moving to Michigan when our second child was a few months old. This is where I was finally(!)done with his bullshit. 

We moved into a crappy apartment, and he got another job selling used cars. I was a stay at home mom. I knew it was a huge mistake to move near his parents a few weeks after arriving. Every time he and I would fight, he would call
his mother and complain about me, or he&#x27;d call my grandmother to &quot;talk some sense into me.&quot; He thought he could go out whenever he wanted, bring whoever over, and I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get angry. I was just supposed to keep my mouth
shut and stay out of the way. If it wasn&#x27;t for my next-door neighbor while I was living here, I probably would have lost my mind.

Fighting between us got so bad, that I decided to go back to NY for the holidays. While I was away, he cheated on me for the second time with one of my neighbor&#x27;s friends. I didn&#x27;t find out about this until a few months later, when
the girl confessed about it. 

During the steady downhill slope that followed, we got into a screaming match in the hallway of our apartment building because he wouldn&#x27;t let me go out for a night. I ended up going anyway and staying
in my neighbor&#x27;s apartment for a couple of days. He had our kids sent to his mother&#x27;s house, without telling me, all because I made him look after them for a couple of days. Needless to say, I was furious and called his mother, 
telling her to bring them back or we&#x27;d have problems. She brought them back, but only to get some more clothes for them. I couldn&#x27;t get them out of her van, because she had the doors locked. I was screaming at her to give the kids
to me and she had the audacity to tell me that I was on drugs. They ended up leaving with the kids, but she didn&#x27;t get far because she had a tail light out, which my neighbor called the cops about. He ended up getting arrested 
again, for violating his probation in Florida.

The final straw came one night when he got into a stupid fight with me over a t.v show and got violent. I ran next door to my neighbor&#x27;s house, and he called my grandmother, pretty much threatening to kill me if she didn&#x27;t pay
for a plane ticket home for me. I left the following morning and didn&#x27;t look back.

The last nine years have been a series of fights over child support, him never calling his children, and assorted other bullshit, which brings us to just this past weekend. He had been someone decent as of late and was actually
paying his child-support relatively on time. We were even being civil to one another, which was an achievement in itself. I guess somehow he finally wanted to be a father to his original two children, after having two new ones
with his new wife. He asked me if I&#x27;d bring them to PA so we could all go to Hershey park for the weekend. I agreed, but then an emergency at my job came up(I work at a cat sanctuary, and my boss had to go to Georgia to pick up 40 
cats from an animal shelter that was being closed down, so they wouldn&#x27;t be put to sleep. He needed me to be there to help him get things ready for his trip), and I asked if we could just go to the park on Saturday, and then I go
back to NY on Sunday, so I could at least help out a bit. At first he agreed, but then turned into an asshole and changed his mind, saying that I owed him the whole weekend with all the money he&#x27;d spent. Luckily, my boss is an 
understanding person(I had told him about the trip a few weeks in advance anyway), so I went on the trip and just ended up going to work first thing Monday morning.

While we were together on the trip, Dick criticized the kids, was rude to me and, to top it all off, wanted to discuss our older daughter moving to Michigan for a year, in a public place, so I couldn&#x27;t argue with him. He pretty 
much said that he didn&#x27;t like how I was raising her(he hadn&#x27;t given a shit before making a new family, mind you), and he wanted to see how she&#x27;d do living with him. I told him that I refused to talk about it while we were supposed
to be enjoying our time together with the kids, and not another word was said about it.

That&#x27;s the story for now. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have more to add to it, if anyone happens to be interested. I&#x27;m not really looking for advice or anything. I just needed to vent it to someone. Happy reading, I guess.</div>
