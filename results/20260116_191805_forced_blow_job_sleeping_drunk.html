            <div class="content collapsed">i want to throw my phone at the wall, reading all of the misogynistic and victim-blaming comments about Nikita Hand (v Conor McGregor).

i need to get this out before my lid <mark>blow</mark>s off. i can&#x27;t even believe this needs explaining to people; surely this should be common sense among adults...

not. every. SA. case. is. the. same.

sometimes, victims are physically restrained and it&#x27;s very gritty. this is what most people assume all SA cases are like.

sometimes, victims are coerced into doing it, so there&#x27;s no kicking and screaming, but the &#x27;consent&#x27; given was purely on the back of their coercion, which isn&#x27;t consent.

sometimes, victims are psychologically manipulated into doing it with the use of scare tactics, threats, etc. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are groomed into doing it. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims aren&#x27;t conscious. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are under pressure due to a power dynamic that puts them in a state of fear for their wellbeing, so they &#x27;consent&#x27; in hope of sparing their life. this is not consent.

sometimes, victims are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. by british law (idk about irish), you cannot consent whilst under the influence as your judgement is impaired.

the list goes on...

i literally want to peel my own eyes out reading the number of posts everywhere about how Nikita must have been lying because she doesn&#x27;t want the CCTV footage leaked to the public.

 1. point blank, by irish law, footage obtained via third-party cannot be published anywhere that is not directly related to the case i.e. nowhere outside the court room.

 2. personally, i wouldn&#x27;t want footage of me prior to a traumatic incident published online either. and i don&#x27;t think you would either.

 3. kissing doesn&#x27;t equal consent. there&#x27;s a startling number of cases in which vile people have R-worded / murdered their victims because they were kissing, but when they said no to sex, they flipped out because they assumed they&#x27;d get it. so whether she was kissing him in an elevator or not is quite frankly irrelevant.

and as a final note, i&#x27;d like to say...

there were 12 people in a jury who sat through all of the actual evidence, much of which we likely have no idea about. those 12 people came to a conclusion based on what was presented to them. so, who are you, a random person sat at home who&#x27;s read a few newspaper articles and watched a few youtube videos, to overturn their decision? yes, verdicts can be wrong and have been overturned in the past. but that&#x27;s in the hands of the professionals. so keep your victim-blaming, misogynistic comments to yourself and let the professionals sort it out.

as for SA survivors out there, please protect your own peace online. it hurts my heart knowing how many victims are reading these horrendous comments defending conor mcgregor, and the indirect impact it&#x27;s having on them and their mental state.

rant over. tysm. i can breathe and get on with my day now.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I’m literally a girl that’s not even 18 yet. I come into an airport and I get all these grown ass stupid old men staring at me, I get the security guys checking my bags as if I’m gonna have something in it. What the fuck do you expect me to do, kill you all with my toothbrush or <mark>blow</mark> up the building with my tampons? I get people in public and at school making fun of me and saying stuff about me, A piece of fabric around my head doesn’t mean I’m gonna touch you or even look in your direction? And for those telling me to go back to my country, you fucking idiots I was born and raised here, my father was born and raised here, i’m literally from Lebanon which is a caucasian country, it’s more European than it is Middle Eastern. Almost everyone in Lebanon is white, and the people there are either Muslim or Christian. I’m a mix of French, Italian, Greek, German, and a little bit of Persian. I’m just like the rest of you I’m a white girl just with rectangular fabric wrapped around my head. I’m your average teenager, I bought air forces and converse because it was trending, i wear baggy jeans like your favorite social media influencers, i shop at your typical “white girl” stores: Hollister, Bath and Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, Nike. I eat white people food at Panera Bread, subway, Vincenzo’s, i’m just like you. I do pilates and yoga, I love science and I’m going into genetics after college, I’m vegan, I donate to charities, I recycle and I promise I’m not gonna kill you 💀. A grown man should not be scared of a girl in high school get over yourself please. “but what about 9/11, you’re not a terrorist but other muslims are” also i’m not making fun of 9/11 it’s just something I get a lot. First of all, my people were killed on that day too and it’s so sad that it happened, but the people who did that are not me or most of your average united states muslim, not every muslim agrees with terrorism like that i fact i think it’s gonna be super hard finding a person in the us who is muslim that agreed with what happened on that day. Also the people who caused it to happen are a different denomination of Islam than I am, ask any Muslim person or any educated person. I’m a God fearing law abiding legal United States citizen that is going to one of the top colleges in my state, I will not hurt you and I never plan to. Also people always only seem to bring up the terrorism that happens here, what about the Ughyir Muslims in the concentration camps out in China? And I haven’t seen anybody talk about the ONE MILLION, ONE MILLION. lives taken in the Rwandan genocide?

I hope all I’ve said changes your opinions and the stigma around most Muslims, let me know your thoughts and feel free to ask questions I’ll try to answer them.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I finally watched the American Eagle x Sydney Sweeney jeans/genes ads and I was appalled. The fact that companies now have the audacity to make a national ad like that doesn&#x27;t bode well. I&#x27;m black so personally I found it to be triggering.  It was obviously a thinly veiled promotion of eugenics.

What creeped me out even more is that in one of the ads, it seemed like the subtext was that she was offering herself to be bred with the goal of passing on her &quot;pure white genes&quot; to future offspring. This is reflective of  the  part of the conservative movement  in the U.S. that resulted in the rollback of Roe v. Wade. White men want to force white women to be nothing more than breeders to increase the white population of the country in order to combat the changing ethnic demographics. It is just as damaging to white women and shows that she is even willing to hurt her own just for a buck.

The discourse surrounding this is also aggravating. Some are literally just gaslighting those who call it out but that&#x27;s nothing new. What annoys me more is seeing people trying to give Sydney nuance and attempt to rationalize her motivations and pretend like she has this complex duality. She&#x27;s just an opportunistic snake oil salesman who is selling her own bathwater and therefore no classier than [this woman](https://people.com/tv/90-day-fiance-stephanie-matto-made-100k-jarring-farts/) who sold her farts online to perverts. We don&#x27;t need to pretend like it&#x27;s anything deeper than that. Sydney Sweeney is a MAGA racist. Racists do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. They haven&#x27;t earned it and never will.

I don&#x27;t have enough faith in the entertainment industry to believe that she will be cancelled for this professionally. But I do think that we should boycott her wherever possible. Women have no reason to buy the jeans she endorses or anything else that they think she can get us to buy.

**Edit:** These are the ads: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ibvR0vLYd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ibvR0vLYd8)

**Edit 2:** My inbox has been flooded by racist trolls who heard the dogwhistle loud and clear. These are people who heard the very real subtext in those videos and answered the call (but were too cowardly to do so in public). To those who have been asking why I have been &quot;<mark>blow</mark>ing this out of proportion&quot; and making such a fuss, consider the fact that multiple racists took time out of their day to verbally assault &amp; harass me because they saw a Reddit post about racism/sexism that they did not agree with. It grates at them when people who they believe to be inferior are vocal, assured, and refuse to accept their desired narrative. Question why I, a woman of color, would then be out of place to verbalize concern when a national ad campaign that is being run by a multi million dollar corporation and endorsed by a mainstream celebrity is promoting eugenics in the country I live in. Then let us all of *good character* question the people questioning that.

**Edit 3:** I&#x27;m adding a link to [this video by Youtuber Leeja Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNSkjm4ETrU) in which she explains the history of Eugenics, it&#x27;s modern day manifestations, and how it ties into the American Eagle ads. Thanks to u/adventurethyme for finding this.

I&#x27;m also going to recommend this full-length PBS documentary called [The Eugenics Crusade ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmRb-0v5xfI)for anyone who is interested in taking an even deeper dive  into this subject for additional knowledge and context. (Because PBS is the gold standard.)

**Edit 4:** [This is a screenshot of a LinkedIn post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMxwNyStYHJ/?img_index=4) from American Eagle&#x27;s VP of Marketing stating that Sweeney had creative influence over the ads and requested to &quot;push the envelope&quot;.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m not sure where exactly to post this. I&#x27;ve been having a surprisingly hard time finding an appropriate subreddit for this if you have any suggestions I am all ears.  But i figure this is at least appropriate here because it is about my experiences as the daughter of a single dad.

I have like 5 or 6 posts devoted to my mother and one to my father and my dad has been a much bigger and better influence on my life then my mom. he deserves a shout out. I am gonna put this in the parenting thread cause maybe other dads of teenage girls will find this useful.

My dad took me in when I was 8. My mom is a toxic alcoholic narcissist mess I am not going to go into the whole backstory of that If you&#x27;re interested  I have some posts made about my relationship with my mom and one about my current relationship with my dad you can find them in my post history but I understand that cross posting to threads is not encouraged so I wont link them here. This post is about my Dad and raising me.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was always supportive of me. Always encouraged me to be whoever and whatever I wanted to be. He never rein<mark>forced</mark> any gender role with me. He encouraged my interests in comics and star wars and video games (yea yea he was into that too so thats probably why but still\_ he never <mark>forced</mark> barbies on me or anything. He also never made me feel like I had to be the son he didn&#x27;t have. He learned to do my hair, he painted my nails with me, he never balked when I showed interest in feminine things or girly clothes. He just let me be and like whatever I wanted. When it came time for prom and I just had to have this expensive prom dress or it would be the absolute end of the world and I would just die without it, he never made a big deal about it. He got it for me because it as important to me. Did he understand? That would be a big fat no. He didn&#x27;t even go to his own prom, but he knew it was important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up as the daughter of a single dad can have its awkward moments, when it came time for my period Yes he did turn all kinds of shades of red. He went to the store came back with a box of tampons and pads handed me both and said I didn&#x27;t know which you would prefer so you&#x27;ll have to figure it out honey and he handed me a fresh pair of panties&quot; But he never made me feel weird or bad or gross about it. This is a little embarrassing but I remember I cried and asked him if I was still his little girl and he just hugged me and told me it was ok and that it was nothing to be embarrassed about. He had ice cream and pizza waiting for me when I came down. We ate pizza ice cream and watched movies that night and the next day he let me stay home from school because I had cramps. He did tell me that I would have to learn to manage it because I couldn&#x27;t always miss school or work. He also took me to an obgyn to make sure there were no problems. He would ALWAYS get me pads when I needed them no questions asked. He would never complain or question why I wanted the more expensive ones, he always made sure I had my favorite chocolates. I learned to not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. I learned not to be embarrassed talking to him about it.

&amp;#x200B;

As I got older I started popping out of my training bras, in another bit of awkward dad moment he took me to pink in a mall because he didnt know where else to go to have me measured for a proper fit. He told the sales ladies I didnt have a mom to help with this stuff and there (at the time) wasnt another woman to help him with this so he handed me his credit card told me what my spending limit was told the girls to help me pick a few age appropriate bras and we would get the majority of what I was gonna need at like target or something once I had my size. Then he told me he was going over to best buy and to call him when I was done lol.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad always encouraged my body autonomy. He always taught me my body belonged to no one but me. No one had any rights to it. I didnt owe anyone hugs or kisses or sex. I didnt even owe him hugs or kisses (but I never hold a hug back from my dad) I was interested in martial arts which he encouraged he has two black belts and he passed that on to me. Its become something we share. I was in middle school when I was groped. I put the guy in an armlock for it and humiliated him in front of the class. The guy had been doing dumb stuff to bother me all year but this was the first time he groped me. We both got in trouble with the school. The school tried to suspend me for fighting but my Dad would not hear of it. He argued with them that I had a right to defend my boundaries and that he taught me to do just that. They didnt walk it back because it was against policy to fight and I should have gotten a teacher or so they said but the important thing here is my dad had my back. My dad came to my defense. He was proud of me for standing up for myself and enforcing my boundaries and he told me the school was stupid. In the real world you may not be able to rely on teachers adults or the police to save you and sometimes you just have to defend yourself. This story isn&#x27;t about me being r/iamverybadass it&#x27;s about my dad having my back.

&amp;#x200B;

He never got mad. He would tell me I disappointed him and that was enough to make me feel bad with out <mark>blow</mark>ing up and yelling and stuff.

My dad was never super controlling or over protective. He had the rules, make sure my chores where done, maintain at least a b average, dont have the police calling him about me. As long as I did what i needed to and I wasnt getting ion trouble with the cops or the school  he gave me the freedom I wanted. If I screwed up he would tell me, tell me what I did wrong, usually ground me but he was never like crazy or controlling.

&amp;#x200B;

He was always really honest with me about his mistakes. He told me all the shit he pulled in hs all the drugs and trouble he got into and just told me not to repeat it. We had one of those agreements that if I was at a party and I felt unsafe or I was too <mark>drunk</mark> to drive or my ride was too <mark>drunk</mark> to drive to call him to come get me and there be no yelling or punishments. In the end he was more concerned with me being safe then him being right.

When it came to dating and sex, They had me when they were 17 so when I hit that age Dad had a talk with me about sex, and got me on birth control so i wouldn&#x27;t wind up pregnant in highschool like my mom did. He never tried to do the whole &quot;you cant have sex until I say so&quot; thing he knew he was doing it at 16 everyone they knew were and I was going to at some point, so  he just wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t repeat their mistakes. He taught me what to watch out for in predatory men, to see the signs of abusive or controlling men and to avoid it. He gave me the whole sex is special between people who love each other talk and rein<mark>forced</mark> body autonomy. He didn&#x27;t exactly encourage me to bring boys or girls home but he we had a dont ask dont tell policy.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came out as Bi to him it was a no brainer. I wasn&#x27;t afraid at all because I had years of trust built up with him and I just knew he would be on my side. He told me something thats turned out to be more true then I could have imagined then. He said I was going to face discrimination from everyone. That I will find straight people who will tell me theres no such thing as BI and I am just straight and want attention, or to tease men or confused, he said I will find gay people that will tell me I am a lesbian and I am just confused and then, I will find the straight guys who will immediately ask for a threesome. He told me they are all wrong. Dont let other people define your identity, be true to yourself and dont let people treat you like a sexual fetish or toy. My dad was right. Over the years I have gotten all of those. Just the other day I got a pm from a straight male saying that being bi was a mental illness and I cant count the amount of times telling a guy I am bi is followed with the ZOMG THREESOME remark.

&amp;#x200B;

Not too long ago I had a terrible date. This guy was being rude to the wait staff, drinking too much, he was loud obnoxious and very chauvinist. I was embarrassed to be out with him. When it came time for the check I paid my half so he had no illusions this was going to lead anywhere with me. He had picked me up but I told him he could just go. I called my dad to come get me. And my dad came. No questions asked.

&amp;#x200B;

The older I get the more I realize how special and amazing my dad is and Im so glad we have such a close and honest relationship. I can trust my dad with anything. I took him for granted growing up thinking all dads were as great as mine but no not every girl is as lucky as I was. My dad is my role model, mentor, coach and best friend I love him to death

Edit: some stuff I forgot. My dad has made a lot of sacrifices for me, we share the same birthday!</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">We got together 5 years ago. Insert typical love story here. It was the same as everyone else I&#x27;ve read up on - he was sweet, kind, caring, compassionate, funny, considerate - a whole different person from who he is today. We met at work. The details aren&#x27;t important, not anymore. We moved in *very* quickly, 3ish months into the relationship. I got very, very sick. Ended up in the ICU for days, almost died. We decided not to waste time after that.

Have I mentioned he&#x27;s my first boyfriend, ever? No point in hiding details, if I&#x27;m going to be honest with myself. He was my first everything. First boyfriend, first live-in boyfriend, first sex partner...he became my everything. 

Enter circa 2013: Like they say, things change when you move in together. We both just thought that we needed to &quot;figure each other out&quot;, idiosyncrasies and whatnot. We fought a lot. At the time, I had become unemployed, as my full time job wouldn&#x27;t let me take time off for my illness and I ultimately had to quit. Finding work again was a lot harder than I thought it would be. I went from a woman who lived independently on her own to relying on her partners support. I remember being stressed and wanted to work on our relationship, while he wanted to play video games from the time he got home until bed. I could feel our relationship sinking back then. The signs were clear.

The first time he, in a way hurt me, was this year. I remember the day clearly. I tried baking french toast overnight in the crock pot - yeah, it didn&#x27;t turn out. I turned it off in morning and decided to trash it, but I had gotten little to no sleep that night. I fell asleep on the couch waiting for the crock pot to cool down. He was furious that I wouldn&#x27;t clean up my mess, asap. I stumbled into the kitchen, cranky, and we began to fight. I insisted I&#x27;d get around to it. Before I knew it, he had my shoulders and shoved me back.

Have I mentioned that I dealt with physical abuse from my farther growing up? Yeah, that&#x27;s sort of important in this story. He knows all the gritty details. My father even tried to kill me, resulting in a restraining order. He knows that anyone - man or woman, but especially man - who gets close up in my face, causes serious anxiety in me. 

It resulted in 3 days of fighting. I spent time away from him. He insisted if I didn&#x27;t return, things would &quot;forever be different.&quot; I was reliant on him. He said he just &quot;got so angry with me&quot; and said things like &quot;I need to respect him and not go off on tangents like that.&quot;

I stayed.

Circa 2014: We moved together. 3 hours from my home town, 2 1/2 from where we first moved in together. Looking back, my inner voice said &quot;ditch this! It&#x27;s only been a year, it&#x27;ll be easier if you just ditch this now.&quot;

I became more reliant on him, especially since I have no family or friends to rely on. This year was real hard. We suffered greatly financially - I still had trouble finding full time work. 

Oh yeah, this is the year I bought him a motorcycle. I got a workers comp settlement from the job we met at (smashed my hand in a door) and spent 30% of it on his motorcycle and 50% on our moving costs. I had initially told myself I&#x27;d use it to go to school. I still really loved him, and wanted nothing but to make him happy. That motorcycle really made him happy.

It&#x27;s all he really did in 2014. Spent a LOT of time riding it. If he wasn&#x27;t riding it, he was playing video games. Our time together greatly diminished. He was upset I didn&#x27;t support his hobbies. He also got in a handful of accidents with this bike - nothing serious, two tip overs and one skid that resulted in massive repair to the bike. The most I remember of this year was him not really being around, and really stressing out about money. Our fights got more violent, he&#x27;d start slamming doors in my face or forcing doors open, refusing to let me leave doorways, getting straight up in my face, ect.

Circa 2015: The year I began therapy. This would be to overcome my trauma from my father. My therapist found out a lot about him, even met him a handful of times as he came to &quot;support&quot; me during sessions. She insisted he was narcissistic and gas-lighting me, and I needed to leave. Smart woman, huh.

I can&#x27;t remember any stand-out details about our fights this year. They all began to blur together. Things that no longer were okay became the norm - shoving me, calling me a bitch, demanding &quot;respect&quot;, insisting I need to &quot;grow up&quot;, ect. I feel this is the year I lost myself. I lost the ability to show emotion the way I use to, the ability to feel, the ability to fight and give a damn. I sunk into routine. 

Circa 2016: The year I REALLY should have left. In my mind, he hadn&#x27;t &quot;hit me&quot; so far. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s made me believe that. I don&#x27;t even remember what started this fight. I just remember being in bed and wanting to go to sleep, so so badly. He wanted to talk, something about us, something that &quot;couldn&#x27;t wait.&quot; The thing here is, anytime the roles would be reversed, he&#x27;d demand &quot;respect&quot; and for me to leave him be until tomorrow. He&#x27;d &quot;have work in the morning&quot; and &quot;couldn&#x27;t stay awake for this.&quot; Suddenly it was okay for ME to have to stay awake with work in the morning. I said we could talk later. Things got heated, he started yelling, I started yelling back, ect ect. Next thing I know he kicked me in the hip. The kick was so hard I rolled out of bed. I was in shock. I took my pillows and blankets and went to sleep on the couch. Yet, for him, the conversation still couldn&#x27;t wait. He followed me out and did what he always did - threatened the relationship, threatened he&#x27;d end us, ect ect. I&#x27;ll never forget, I said &quot;well maybe that would be for the best.&quot; Suddenly he&#x27;s hugging me, caressing my hair, and in the sweetest tone said &quot;It&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll always be your friend.&quot; I&#x27;m suddenly WTF about the whole thing. He left, and the next morning - I guess we were broken up. &#x27;Cause that&#x27;s what he was saying. 

Why the fuck did I do damage control on this? Why didn&#x27;t I let him believe what he wanted to believe and leave?

Oh, probably &#x27;cause I have no where else to go.

Damage control it was then. I insisted I never said we should break up - which, hey, was true! It took time, but we &quot;got back together&quot; - all this being in his eyes. To me, it was another stupid fight we had to reconcile from. To this day he insist we broke up that night and I begged him to come back. Jesus...

This is also the year he lost his job. The same job I kept telling him he&#x27;d be fired from - welp, they fired him. Stupid reasons honestly and I kept telling him they were out to get him, and he needed to find other work before it happened. He never listened to me. He usually doesn&#x27;t.

He cashed out his 401k. He bought a new motorcycle. He crashed the motorcycle and ended up incapacitated for a month.

Circa 2017: This year sucked. I spent my time wiping his ass and supporting us with two jobs while he recovered. I remember this year as not doing a single damn thing I wanted to do. Work, take care of him, sleep, repeat. I caved and got a kitten off craigslist, cause F it, I wanted to. She&#x27;s been my light and savior so far, adorable little thing. Other than that, 2017 was a pointless year for me.

Circa 2018: We celebrated 5 years at the end of February. It was awful. I paid for our dinner. I bought some sex toys to try and spice up the bedroom - which has been dead for a while. He got a <mark>blow</mark> job from me and fell asleep. I tried to coax him into playing with me, and he sighed and groaned through the whole thing, like it was a chore. I wrapped it up before it could get any worse. This anniversary was clear - we have nothing between us anymore.

Exactly 5 days later he punched me.

He&#x27;s gung-ho on this DJ gig he has coming up. He wanted to post promotional images on Instragram but didn&#x27;t know how. I showed him some apps he could use to make some really eye-catching images, really easy. For 2 hours I heard him complain about how &quot;unnecessary&quot; it was to &quot;go through all of this.&quot; Ie: put text to a stock image. I kept telling him if he wants to be this big DJ he&#x27;s set out to be, he needs to catch people&#x27;s attention. He decided on using an Instagram color background with black text. I flat out told him no one will take that seriously. 

Next thing I knew, my phone was across the room, he was in my face, spit was on my cheeks, and he was screaming at me. Something about how I want &quot;shut the fuck up&quot; and &quot;disrespecting him.&quot; He then grabbed the phone from the floor and threw it on my stomach, where it bounced and landed back on the floor.

I picked up my phone, sighed, and said I was going upstairs. I had barely blinked during all of this. Didn&#x27;t scream back, didn&#x27;t curse, didn&#x27;t even flinch. I&#x27;ve lost the ability for that. This has become normal for me.

Suddenly he was in the doorway leading upstairs. He refused to let me go. I kept reminding him what my therapist said - if throwawaycherry92 needs 5 minutes alone in another room, you need to let her do that. I said I&#x27;d be back in 5 minutes, we could regroup and discuss things when he was calmer. 

I remember his eyes were pure crazy. I have never, ever seen so much crazy in someone&#x27;s eyes before than in that moment.

He insisted we talk, there and now, and that I &quot;NEEDED&quot; to listen to him, and I &quot;NEEDED&quot; to respect him, and I &quot;NEEDED&quot; to stay here. Ect ect. I explained, calmly, I don&#x27;t need to do anything, I am my own person, and I was going upstairs. I remained calm. I spoke calm. Eventually, maybe 3 minutes later, I gave up. He clearly wasn&#x27;t letting me move past him. I sighed.

That sigh was his breaking point. The next thing I knew, I was seeing stars. He had shoved me into the wall. He knocked my glasses off my face - purposefully, and then his hand came across my eyes. He shoved me again. He was screaming obscenity&#x27;s at the top of his lungs. I pushed past him and quickly went upstairs, for my own safety.  On my way up, I could hear the computer chair fly across the room. Once upstairs, I could hear him punch a hole in the wall. Once my door closed, the kitchen table chairs were smashed against the ground.

All of that would have been me if I waited any longer.

For 10 minutes he screamed. 

&quot;You never SHUT THE FUCK UP!&quot;
&quot;Go back to live with your FUCKING MOTHER or GODAMN SISTER, I don&#x27;t GIVE A FUCK!&quot;
&quot;You wonder why we don&#x27;t make LOVE!? You wonder why I don&#x27;t want to TOUCH YOU!? WHO THE FUCK WOULD WANT TO TOUCH A BITCH LIKE YOU!?&quot;
&quot;Look what YOU&#x27;VE DONE to ME! I DON&#x27;T ACT LIKE THIS! YOU DID THIS TO ME!&quot;

He said more. So much more. I blocked it out. I locked my door, cried, cried some more, and eventually crawled into bed.

Four hours later he opened the door, sighing, and sadly saying my name. I said we&#x27;d talk about it in the morning.

The next morning he left for work. He came to say goodbye to me, I said goodbye back. He said he loved me, I didn&#x27;t respond. He sent a text message that morning, the morning after.

&quot;I know I was out of line and said and did things that were not right. I do love you and I want you in my life but this is becoming increasingly more difficult and should not be. Simple, small things are irritating me and irradiating you...our comparability is constantly called into question. We may love each other but I don&#x27;t think we can stand each other enough to live together. Last night started out so promising and quickly devolved into arguing and tempers flaring. I am sorry for my part in this. I love you but I am starting to think that this is not going to work out no matter how much we want it too because we both want, expect and are looking for different things. Obviously I am not making decision right now I want to talk to you first and I know this is terrible timing so soon after our anniversary...we should not be like this. I don&#x27;t know what else to do.&quot;

I responded with a photo of the black eye he gave me.

I also said he needs help. He desperately needs to seek help, because no one can control his behavior besides himself, and no one has turned him into who he is today aside from himself.

He came by the bedroom (we have not slept together since) to say goodmorning and goodnight yesterday. Sent a text saying &quot;love you&quot; the same day. Today he yelled &quot;goodbye&quot; from downstairs as he left. He hasn&#x27;t responded to my text messages telling him to get help. He hasn&#x27;t acknowledged, not once, the black eye.

That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at today.

I know I&#x27;m fucked. I know I put myself here. There&#x27;s not much you can do or say for me that I don&#x27;t already know. I need to leave, I need to start an exit plan, ect ect.

But really, I first needed to type this all out. I needed something to remind myself it&#x27;s real. That I can&#x27;t go back to him after this and pretend it didn&#x27;t happen, like I always do. This was real.

TL;DR: 5 years of abuse got me my first black eye.



UPDATE: I sent him a text saying that I was willing to hear him talk, but I&#x27;m still not ready to discuss things. I explained he needed to be okay with a 1 sided conversation and having our roommate present in the house in case he got violent again.

&quot;Hi,  I love you,  good to hear from you.  I know its a bit much to ask and I&#x27;m sure you haven&#x27;t thought about it so let me put this out there.  Have you considered that your actions or lack there of may have collectively been a small influence on my behavior? As I am sure you can attest,  I may not be the most responsible or the best listener but I have an extremely high amount of tolerance and patience. What could have brought me to this breaking point? If its not something you can discuss then that is fine just take an abnormally long amount of time thinking about it.&quot;

Unreal. I&#x27;m not surprised, just so hurt. I&#x27;m being blamed for him giving me a black eye. ....just...ugh.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">

It seems that this round of violence is over and it is time for either side of the conflict to look at the balance of gains and losses and its effect on its overall strategy and policies for the future.
After 50 days of bitter fighting, that neither side really wanted to engage in at the beginning, with horrendous price in human life and huge losses to economies of both parties, it seems that neither side has emerged from the conflict as a clear victor. In fact both sides come out bruised ,taking of course into account the proportion of the huge gap in power both military and economically between Gaza and Israel.
Prime minister Netanyahu together with defense minister Yaalon and chief of staff Ganz appeared in a press conference last Wednesday and tried to portray the war as big victory over Hamas saying it had received such heavy <mark>blow</mark>s it will be extremely difficult for it to regain its military capabilities in the near future, and that none of its goals and demands have been fulfilled. That may be true, but we have to consider the fact that Hamas and the Gazan population, for that matter, does not look at the military outcome as the only yardstick to measure the total outcome   of the round. For them the mere fact that they held in for 50 days against the might of the Israeli army and kept firing till the last moment is a huge moral achievement in their eyes. 
While the moral outcome and the narrative war on who won has its importance, we have to examine the results of the round on both the domestic and the Middle Eastern arenas and even the global one for both parties.
Hamas entered the conflict in a very crucial situation for its existence, it had lost its main supporter in Egypt when general A-Sisi seized power and blocked the tunnels on his side of the borders, the tunnels which were the lifeline to Hamas both in armament and in money and goods. Hamas had begun to lose control on the its members as it did not have enough money to pay their salaries and the economic situation of the whole population had deteriorated to the point that Hamas leaders were <mark>forced</mark> to agree on a joint government with the PA . This has raised the fears in the armed wing of losing its exclusive control in Gaza , as I have said in previous articles, a fact which in its turn has dragged them to the war.  So what is the real outcome of the war for Hamas?
Hamas had hoped to force the ME and world powers to use their influence to lift the blockade that Israel had imposed on the strip. So far it has failed in achieving  that goal Egypt had promised it to relax somewhat the restrictions on the Rafah border crossing point but with the supervision of the PA officials  and a joint committee between Israel Egypt and the PA  was formed  to supervise entering of all good to the strip, hardly what Hamas had hoped for.
The other demands that Hamas has made were not accepted either. Neither the maritime port nor the airport . All they got was an agreement to put it on the negotiating table, if and when it will take place. They also did not get any agreement to transfer money to pay its military and civil employees. 
All they got is back to square one i.e. ceasefire. And that is after the enormous damages that the Gaza strip has suffered and after using and losing roughly two thirds of its rockets and missiles arsenal and its offensive tunnels in addition to 1000 of its armed personnel. 
Hardly a result to be proud of. 
Worse than that, the ending of the armed conflict has exposed the differences between the local leadership of Hamas (Haniyya and others) and the political leadership who live in Qatar i.e. Khalid Mashaal.
The local leadership had virtually <mark>forced</mark> the political one to accept the ceasefire, stating that they could no longer withstand the Israeli <mark>blow</mark>s.
All in all, Hamas has put itself in an awkward position.  It has become more dependent on the Egyptian goodwill. It was obliged to give room to the PA forces in the strip as supervisors, and the Qatari and Iranian support relies again on the good will of Egypt. On top of that it hasn’t gained any international support as it had hoped.  This situation puts the Hamas regime in Gaza in a real danger as to its power to survive.it all depends now on the outcome of the negotiations that are about to take place after a month.
The side that has benefitted the most from the conflict is the Palestinian authority and its president Mahmud Abbas who was considered a lame duck before the outbreak and has become more and more relevant after it has ended. There are news about a secret meeting between Abbas and Netanyahu in that took place in Amman recently and that is after Netanyahu had insisted for months that Abbas cannot &quot;deliver the goods &quot;.
Abbas was asked also to lend his troops to the mission of supervising the entrance of goods to the strip, a move that could pave the way to the return of the PA to Gaza.
 
In Israel the situation after the ceasefire has come into effect reveals a disappointment and disaffection of the Israeli public from its leadership and from the way the conflict was concluded. Poles that were taken after the announcement of the ceasefire showed that most Israelis were against the agreement, the general feeling is that we have suffered 70 casualties and 50 days of rockets shelling that has damaged the economy and paralyzed the south just to go back to where we were before the outbreak, and that Israel was not able to bring Hamas to its knees as it should have done. The goal of disarming Hamas was not achieved either and there are no assurances against its rearming.
 Israel is still under the rockets threat and although most of the tunnels were destroyed it did not destroy Hamas&#x27;s capability to dig others. The polls also show that Netanyahu popularity has dropped in about 25% compared to the pre outbreak period.
Netanyahu is facing now a double threat to his leadership, both from the right wing and from the left wing.  He suffered fierce criticism during the fighting from the right for what they considered an indecisive and hesitant manner of conducting the war and refraining from an all-out offensive to destroy Hamas. This criticism came also from the cabinet ministers who also accused the defense minister and the chief of staff in a lack of fighting spirit and accuses Netanyahu of dodging the cabinet and taking the decision on the ceasefire only with the defense minister Yaalon, in a move which is legal but is not decent in their opinion.
In addition to that there are voices within the Likkud, Netanyahu&#x27;s own party, who attack him saying that this is his last term in office.
 The left, or at least the moderates in it ,  did not criticize Netanyahu way of conducting the war but rather his politics which ,to their opinion has led to the outbreak , that is his lagging tactics to avoid real negotiations with the PA which could have created a different situation. 
The public opinion polls also show that the right wing is getting stronger in the aftermath of the war the right religious party &#x27;&quot;The Jewish home&quot; would get according to the polls 17 seats and the Likkud party is down to 19 seats without Liberman&#x27;s &quot;Israel our home&quot; party.
The Israeli political scene is therefore very volatile now, as Netanyahu is challenged from both sides of the map and he does not have the support of the Obama administration. This could mean changes in the Israeli leadership in the near future.
In conclusion we can say that the last outbreak of violence has benefitted none of the warring parties, but rather caused them heavy losses that we have only just begun to asses. None of the basic problems, such as lifting the blockade or the disarmament of Hamas&#x27; have been addressed, so the sad reality is that we might see another outbreak in the coming year or two.

            <div class="content collapsed">So for my birthday i took a trip back down to vegas to visit fam and whatnot, and me and my sister are hanging out watching GoT when her friend calls her hysterically crying, says she cant even talk so she texts my sister.

Apparently she was with a &quot;friend&quot;(girl) hanging out driving when they saw 2 boys, so my sisters friend(we&#x27;ll call her &#x27;G&#x27;) hops out to say hi, because apparently she knew one of the boys girlfriends. Anyways the next details are kinda merky for me, but apparently G&#x27;s &quot;friend&quot; was irritated she was taking so long and drove off, leaving her to get a ride from them...

Now G used to live in vegas but has since moved to a different state, my sister has visted her once or twice and says its a really bizarre place, everyone is really sketchy and rich and into drugs and shit.

Anyways she gets in the car with these guys, and they must have been under the influence of something i guess. (i&#x27;m not 100% on all the details) It started with some aggressive sexual talk, then went to her in the backseat with a guy and he pulls his dick out and trys pushing her head down on it, her mouth is touching it, she says she tried to resist but when youre freaking out your mouth is going to open, anyways they didnt force that for that long from how it sounds, he reached down on her to start fingering, and trying to lay on top of her, not all at once but throughout the ride this is how it progressed, she eventually hit him enough in the jaw when he was on her that he said fuck it. He did not penetrate, and they ended up parking and letting her out and telling her not to tell. 

Now she is 17, I don&#x27;t know her personally, but my sister vouches that shes not a compulsive liar or someone who would make this up or fabricate it at all. So i&#x27;ll trust my sisters vouch on this.

Anyways she doesnt wana tell anyone, because she&#x27;s afraid everyone will judge and be mad at her, which is <mark>blow</mark>ing my mind. I told my sister to try to work her over, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s just being swept under an emotional rug, this cant be good for ANYONE to hold inside, much less a 17 year old. Obviously these fuckers need to be brought to justice because who knows what they&#x27;ll be into when theyre adults, but moreso this girl needs emotional support and help and to be cared for, right?

My sister has her moms numbers, and i told my sister maybe we should go behind G&#x27;s back and tell her mom, even if it ruins her friendship. Is this the right thing, or will it just push her further to the darkside. Is this even remotely the right sub for this? help me reddit

Sorry if this is worded horribly, im not the best at literature, and im in between a triple shift at work.

Edit: i asked my sister about her mom, apparently her mom is a good person and mother. If relevant. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I M(22) and my Grandmother, (60) Along with her wife (62) All live in the same house. We all used to get along very well, almost movie-like. Throughout my childhood I have nothing but good memories with them, till I grew up. I remember my first genuine time feeling a loss of connection and seeing this decline in treatment. I was 10 mowing the lawn, as I always do. This time I was excited to mow the lawn, it was for my birthday party! I’ve never had one before and this was going to be my first one! I started off with the front yard, got that mowed. Fast as I could, as nice as I could. I swiftly moved to the back yard, I almost forgot the gate behind me! I close it and I turn on the mower to start the yard. It started off good and I get about halfway through the yard and it became almost impossible to push thing. My little 10yr old body couldn’t do it. So I look at my grandma and she’s in the yard gardening, so I run over to her and tell her the mower isn’t working, and I run back over, turn it on and try pushing it. Our yard is small, so it was only a good few steps, it was all in one good motion. She sees me turn on the mover and start pushing it, idk what it looked like from her view but I remember pushing this thing with all my might and suddenly my grandmas yelling at me telling me if I don’t start pushing this mower I’m grounded. “STOP FUCKING AROUND AND PUSH THE DAMN MOWER! I Swear to god… eerrrg” “Grandma I can’t! It’s stuck!” “You better stop playing around before you’re grounded” “IM NOT PLAYING IT WONT MOVE” My Grandmas wife comes in “Look, if I can push the mower, you’re going to your room and there will be no party. Understood?” “Yes, but I-“ “stop. You heard what we said, so you better hope you’re not lying to us.” “I swear I’m not!” She moves me back, and grabs the mower, gives it a tug and it starts, she looks at me, and starts to push, you see her realize that this mower is harder to push than normal, she even adjusted her stance to push it better, and begins pushing the mower. This scolding look shot back at me, both of them glaring, and immediately got sent to my room. Fast forward a few years, and now I’d be 13. Already I’d get sent away every summer to either a relatives, a summer camp, or just wasn’t allowed to home unless it was an emergency. I remember initially, I would want to go to these places or not be at home, average 13yr old mindset just wants to be away, right? But I’d only want a day to myself, or a weekend or something? You know? And I’d ask for this or that when I wanted to go do it and usually I was told “no” unless it was a rare occasion. And so I got used to this routine of being having an idea and being told off, so any real idea I had I would just go back into my room or outside and forget about it, right? Well I remember my grandparents would come to me, practically offering up “hey do you wanna do this still?” “Remember when you wanted to do this” I’d always reply “no..?” And they would begin going “yes you do! Trust me you do” “you mentioned it this and this time ago cmon let’s go” almost making it seem like this is my idea. Feeling more like I’m being pushed off. Now with that mind, I spend my whole 13th summer at my aunts house. Didn’t even drive past my grandparents house. Not once. I get home exactly a week before school. I’m walking up to the porch fresh out of the car, all 3 duffel bags plus one backpack all around me full of random clothes, stuff I found, video games. Random 13yr old junk. I walk up the front porch and I’m greeted with the front door swinging wide open. Now never once in my life have I had a door open for me, so I’m already confused at that gesture in itself. But now this doors wide open and my grandmas giving me the most evil stare I’ve ever seen. Clenching her jaw together so unbelievably tight, you would’ve thought she had no teeth! She’s giving me this hard glare through her glasses, as if the sun is shining through a magnifying glass, I can feel the heat of her look beaming my face. And I start getting worried, cuz what did I do wrong that this is how I’m greeted? Honestly I couldn’t think of a thing I did wrong. I didn’t leave my room a mess when I left? I didn’t stomp on her deck, I didn’t yell when walking up, I didn’t lose anything of mine, so I figured it must not be for me. She’s not mad at me, I’m in the way of whatever she’s looking at. Maybe my aunt? So I begin to start walking in. And I feel a hand on my head stop me. “What do you think you’re doing?” “Uh? Coming inside?” “No you’re not.” “Uh..?” “You’re not stepping foot inside this house till you tell me the truth.” “Uh? About what?” “You know EXACTLY what I talking about.” “No I don’t? What’d I do wrong?” “Don’t lie to me. Where is it.” “Where is what? I’m not even inside yet!? What is wrong?” “Stop playing dumb. Get your ass inside. Right now.” “Well now I don’t want to. You look like you’re gonna hit me!?” “Well smart guy, that’s because I am.” “For what!? I didn’t even do anything!? What is wrong with you!?” “BECAUSE YOU STOLE MY PILLS!!” “I STOLE!? And PILLS!?” “STOP ACTING LIKE A FUCKING DUMBASS AND.. get… your… ASS IN HERE!!” “Well..? NO! Why would I do that!? I’m not taking a step closer to you till you tell me what pills are gone!? Why you even have pills and o haven’t even been here all summer where tf would I have the time to come back here and steal whatever mf pill you planned to take!?” “Wait.. you really didn’t take my medication?” “No! Now move! Why am I being asked this shit!? I didn’t even do anything to you” and walked into my room and sat down and plugged my game in, cuz what else am I going to do at 13, mad asf? Skip another few years, and I’m 16 almost 17 got maybe a month till. From that moment of the pills, I’ve never forgiven my grandma for accusing me of stealing her medicine. Still to this day I hold that grudge. And gladly. It’s a reoccurring conversation. Even after she found out who stole her pills, she still has never said sorry to me for accusing me of stealing from her, let alone something as important as her daily medication. Well the 3 of us; Me, my Grandma, and her wife, all stopped getting along so swiftly. There’s always an argument, always a problem, always something missing, or “stolen” just something always “wrong” per se. I decide to clear some of this heat between all of us, I’ll invite a couple friends over for the day and stay out of my grandparents hair. So I invite my cousin, and my homie. They both come over and arrived relatively the same time. Walking in after one another. My cousin came in first, door shuts behind him, a couple seconds, maybe a minute goes by and my homie walks in! Everyone’s greeted, and friendly and happy to see each other, my grandmas on the couch getting ready to go outside. “Hey guys, are you two doing good in school?” “Yes maam” they replied almost in unison. “Well then maybe you can teach my Grandson a thing or two” They look at each other kinda weird “okay..?” “He’s failing everything and idk if he’s stupid or just doesn’t care, but if you guys are doing better maybe some positive influence might help him” and she went outside. Both of them come in with this look and tell me step for step what happened, offended she would’ve even asked them that, like they were off put. They exclaimed that they didn’t want to come back here if that’s going to be their first impressions not having their parents around. They both stated that if at any point I wanted to stay at their house for a night I was more than welcome. I brushed it off and went on with the normal chill sesh. I was then asked to go pick up my little cousin from home, on a bike a ride. I ride BMX so he loved when I rode around w him. I told her I would when everyone left, and about an hour later everyone’s getting ready to leave and pack up their things so I go to get my bike ready and my riding shoes on. I decide to go ask my grandmas wife why the car isn’t in the driveway since it was there a second ago. She said “your other grandma took it because she said you refused to go get your little cousin.” I said “no? What is her problem? I literally asked her to wait till everyone left. I’m not gonna leave my friends here to go get my little cousin and I sure won’t force them to come with me.” “Well then sir, I assume it seems like your friends should’ve left a little sooner then, shouldn’t they have?” I just said “whatever” and walked back into the house. Just before I walked inside I said “hey, by the way, if it’s okay with you can I go to my homies house since she already left then?” “Yeah I don’t care that fine” and I start getting ready again, normal shoes, and clothes this time, and I ask my homie if he minds taking my cousin home so we don’t leave him here. And my cousin heard me, and said “no actually you’re good. My mom’s on her way right now.” I said, “well how far is she?” Would you like us to wait here with you? Or is she down the street?” He said “I have her location on my phone. She’s sitting at the red light just up the road. Then she has to turn down your side street and she’ll be here” I said “okay, well we’ll wait outside feel free to come with you’d like to wait outside with us.” My grandma comes walking in as I say that. And sees my and my buddy getting ready to leave, My cousin sitting on the couch waiting to leave. And she <mark>blow</mark>s up. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN WAIT OUTSIDE!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!? YOU INVITE HIM OVER HUST TO MAKE HIM WAIT HERE WHILE YOU LEAVE WHAT THE FUCK!?..” and just kept on going, yelling, all this &amp; that. So me and my homie look at each other, just walk out, hop in his car, and leave. As we’re pulling off we both hear “AS SOON AS YOU TURN THAT CORNER YOURE NO LONGER WELCOME IN THIS HOUSE! YOU HEAR ME!? YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE SHIT!” Fast forward again, I’m now 22. I just started keeping in contact with my Grandma this past year, and come to find out, while I was away and ignoring their existence, her wife got 3 types of cancer. Blood cancer, lung cancer, and bone cancer, she has pancreatitis, and stomach ulcers. So when I heard that, I offered to come help take care of her. Well little did I know what I was getting myself into. I was ready to help pay for food, bills, hospital trips, gas for cars, etc. but what I wasn’t ready for, was both parents to be sick. One has 3 cancers and more, and other one (come to find out) is losing her mind. LITERALLY!! Mind you I just sold my house so I could move in with these two, and take proper care of them and so they have my attention at all times, they have 4 kids my grandma has 1 son, and her wife has 3 daughters. They all have full families of their own, or don’t care enough to come by and figure out what’s going on. They just expect texts or calls with updates. So I chose to come in and do the job, because someone needs to take care of the people who raised us, my mom wasn’t around to raise me so they did. I guess it’s my turn right? That’s how I look at it. Well I’ve been here for 5 months, and now that you’re caught up with some back story, here’s where I’m lost. Right? So as I said, I sold my house and moved in. I pay for all the groceries, gas, car payments, house bills, everything. And none of these things I own. For these past 5 months it’s been all I can afford. Just normal adult life, but now instead for one person I’m paying for 3. I get it that’s what I signed up for. Yet I’m being down upon every chance there is. My grandparents have ruined relationships with everyone around them. And constantly continuing to do so. One of my cousins I decided to invite over, he hasn’t seen his grandmas in forever and I haven’t seen him in even longer than that. So he comes over hangout w me for about an hour and goes and talks to our grandmas. Well obv I’m going to sit back and let him spend his time with them, but occasionally I do get bored and wanna see what’s going on yk? Just curious. So I walk outside where everyone’s at, and I come say hi and stand around and participate in the conversation they’re having, and my grandma slowly turns it around into “hey aren’t you just so happy you have money to spend?” Talking to my cousin, and he responds casually “yeah I’m actually really proud of myself it feels good” and I congratulate him and tell him to keep it up fr, I’m happy he’s got himself in a spot he’s content in. And my grandma looks dead at me “see why can’t you do something like what he does. He actually has money to spend” I said “grandma don’t start. It’s not worth it right now” she said “well while you’re an adult living with your grandmas and he’s living on his own, don’t you think that’s kinda funny?” I said “not so funny when I’m the one paying all the bills in the house.” She replies with “looks see how ungrateful he is? Thinks he pays my for house-“ I cut her off. “Actually I pay your rent. $1300 for the house alone, not including property or utilities. Maybe I should call your landlord and tell him you’re gonna start paying all the bills.” She growls, and snaps back “errg.. YOU KNOW WHAT!? MAYBE I WILL CALL YOUR UNCLE AND TELL HIM TO KICK YOU OUT OF HIS HOUSE BECAUSE YOURE NOTHING BUT DISRESPECTFUL!” I laughed, crackled more-like and said “what’s he going to do? Kick out the only person paying him here? Good luck.” and turned around. Lit myself up a cigarette, and started to walk inside. She yells, talking to my cousin “you see?? You see how he treats me! He told me I’m nothing to him! Can you believe that!?. I’m nothing to him!” And started hyperventilating like she’s losing her life. First off maam, you’re my grandma. But you’re not old, not like that anyway. 60 years old throwing a fake tantrum. Cmon. That was so set up MTV wouldn’t have even aired it. So once again I chuckle, and kinda glance back on my walk up to the door, and keep on my way, she yells at me, “what’s so funny!?” I say “you are” and walk inside. Sheotly after my cousin walks in, I’m standing in the kitchen chain smoking cigarettes being pissed off, my grandmas wife is pissed off with me, telling me a story about “when I was doing this &amp; this earlier she was going off on me! She locked all the doors! I couldn’t even get into my own room! I’m tired of her! I’m tired of her shit! I’m tired of her drug use! Her doctors think they’re doing her good but she snorts everything! Then she wants to pretend she all high and mighty but keeps doing shit to show the world she’s nothing more than an old junkie!” And my and my cousin kinda stop and look at her, I have this confused glare cuz now I’m pissed off and slightly confused about the fact I just found out my grandmas a junkie, my cousin confused on why everyone’s so heated, and I just go “yeah it’s amazing how I do everything for that woman and it still isn’t enough, and walk to my room. Then my cousin comes in. And the only thing he said to me was “dude you need to get the absolute fuck out of here. I’ll help you save.” And I looked at him and said it’s hard to save taking care of 3 people and all their animals homie. We got 5 cats and a dog, plus the 3 of us, I’m saving all I can. Trust me.” And he looks at me and goes “stop telling people when you get paid. Not even grandmas. Don’t let anyone know. Just pay this shit off do what you gotta do, and get it over with. They don’t deserve the help of that’s how they’re going to act.” And I just agreed with him. We sat and played more video games, then I took him home. The very next morning, my little cousin had showed up sometime through our drive of taking the other cousin home. And I had gotten back home and went straight to sleep. I had just worked earlier that day and this all happened within a course of 4 hours. I wake up, play some games, get half way ready for the day, and I call my buddy. I ask him “hey do you mind hanging out later today? And I thought I’d also ask if, while we hung out if you minded taking me for a haircut, I can pay you gas if you’d like.” He said “yeah that’s fine. I’m free right now if you wanna chill now, I can take you for your haircut right now then we can chill after. Just to kinda get it out of the way?” I said “yeah that’ll be perfect lemme go shower” he said “cool I’m otw now, putting my shoes on” and we hung up. As I’m grabbing clothes I hear someone go to the bathroom. So I wait. I hear the floor open, and I come out of my room, and see my buddy literally pulling up to my house as I’m walking out to take my shower, so real fast I call him, “hey man my grandma was in the bathroom is it ok if I still shower rq it’ll only be a minute?” “Yeah bro that’s completely fine just come out when you done” and I hang up and turn around, from looking at my buddies truck. And my grandmas now behind me. Whisper-yelling talking about some “YOURE GONNAWAKE UO THE LITTLE ONES BEING ALL LOUD AND ON THE OHONE! YOURE SO SELFISH! HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING FOR YOURSELF! Never anyone else has to be you. Just all you. Only you. No one else” im like “bro I just told my ride I have to shower, they’re waiting on me?” She says “well isn’t that great!?” Starts walking back to the bathroom, and so Im questioning her “you just came out of the bathroom, why’re you going back in!?” And I start following behind her with all my clothes n stuff in my hand, she locks the door behind her. “Grandma why’d you lock the door?” She says “because I can!” “Grandma! Please get out! I have to go! I’m trying to go get my haircut!” “I’ll start listening to you when you start listening to me!” “Grandma! Cmon!” So I decided to pull out my phone, I record “Grandma. Will you PLEASE unlock yourself from the bathroom so I may use the shower” “Nope not till you start listening” “Grandma please get out pf the bathroom!” “Nope! Im putting my dentures in!” So I stop the recording, “when did you get dentures” “yesterday” “well can you put em in when you actually need em. You’re doing this out of spite.” “Yes I am. So go fuck off” so I walked away, grabbed her car keys, and hid them in the bathroom closet. She comes walking out about 15 minutes later, I’m back on the phone with my buddy talking to him telling him what’s going on while I’m waiting and she says “you’re good now.” Then I go take my shower and I come back out. My little cousins now awake. I ask him “I didn’t wake you up did I?” He goes “No grandma was stomping around and being loud” I said “you sure it wasn’t me? My showering or anything?” He said “no I thought you were asleep” I said “I’m sorry buddy. Grandma can be like that when she wakes up sometimes. I gotta go get my haircut though, I already know you’re gonna ask, yes you can play my games.” And I left me and my buddy are on our way back to the house after my haircut and I get this nasty long ass paragraph from my grandma telling me I owe her money, I’m kicked out, if this or this happens legal action will be made. So I replied with a screenshot of a police report already pending against her, and reminded her all I need is a video of one of her outbursts to settle it. Our local police department felt the need to give me a personal case worker assigned to only this case, to find out whether she needs a mental illness rehabilitation center or time behind bars. And since nothing has turned violent they’re leaning towards a mental facility. With that, me and my buddy came back k to the house and everything was fine for the day. Till the next morning where all the arguments started back again, but about different things, now I don’t owe her money from the same thing before but somehow I owe her less and for a different reason. Now I owe her marijuana too? I don’t know? Either way all this fighting and nonstop drama has caused me to feel like I no longer want to be here to help out. I feel like everything I do just isn’t right or isn’t enough, I feel like it’s constant arguing, over the dumbest of things, sometimes what seems to be over genuinely nothin? At the same time, I came here to take care of them while being ill, and I know a lot of these lash outs are because she’s ill now, and I know she won’t admit it to herself, I know for a fact that’s a battle she’s fighting and partially why she’s so angry all the time, along with loss of control and other things. But even knowing this attempting to understand and see through it from her side, I just can’t seem to shake the feeling a lot of this is targeted, if not targeted it’s at the very least an active effort to push people away maybe not just me? But I’m at my end, and idk whether to move back into my own place or to just stay and deal with it all. I’m genuinely lost. I’m going absolutely insane just trying to figure out what the right move is. I just need some advice please, Reddit.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Sorry if this is too long and excuse any typos

September of last year I moved in with a guy I met off an app for roommates. We were complete strangers when we met. We&#x27;re around the same age (32, 33). He&#x27;s in the military, the Army to be exact.

He&#x27;s an alcoholic and he&#x27;s aware of it. It didn&#x27;t take me long to start seeing red flags. 

1. He&#x27;s not clean. I come home from work (mind you I work two jobs) and it&#x27;s empty beer bottles scattered around the house, multiple empty beer boxes in the fridge, takeout food from weeks ago still there. His dirty drawers on the bathroom floor. His room is a complete mess!

He also has a dog that he doesn&#x27;t clean up after very well. It even got to the point where I was buying the dog food and dog pads and he was still too lazy to even put food in her bowl or put a pad down for her to pee on. I was constantly cleaning up poop and pee because he&#x27;d rather be somewhere in the house slumped out tipsy or at a bar. I&#x27;m constantly having to clean up the house and after him and his dog. He would basically dump the dog on me and dissapear. Sometimes he wouldn&#x27;t even come back til the next day and I literally have to text him at 2AM to see if he&#x27;s okay. 

2. He has violent outbursts. About maybe 2 and a half weeks of living together he invites me out to a bar with one of his friends. Everything is fine until we get back to the house. He goes to his room, strips down to his underwear and comes back out and turns into the Hulk. Punching walls, counters, screaming etc. I calm him down and he had a breakdown on the couch so I consoled him for about 15 minutes. He apologized and then I tucked him into bed (literally). The next day he tried to blame me for it? I was confused because I didn&#x27;t do anything. The outbursts continued. One night we were talking about how we first met and he said he likes to size dudes up and was like (I could probably kill this guy), and then out of nowhere he reaches out and puts his hand around my throat. He didn&#x27;t squeeze but it caught me off guard and he apologized for being so aggressive. He apologizes but it keeps happening. I told him the next day what had happened and he laughed it off and said it was just a love choke. 

He&#x27;s also very reckless. When we go out he&#x27;s drinking and driving, speeding like crazy and endangering my life. I tell him to stop and he eventually does but he does the same thing everytime we go out. We&#x27;re at bars and he&#x27;s aggressively chasing after every women he sees, <mark>drunk</mark> out of his mind. He even goes up to girls who are with their boyfriends. After we leave bars he doing more dumb shit like pissing in public and attracting the attention of the police.

3. He involves me in his lies. He&#x27;s in a relationship but unfaithful. He started bringing his sidechick around which I really didn&#x27;t mind but he pretty much expected me to lie and cover for him whenever she asked about other women or if he was doing dirt. I was literally hiding his girlfriends belongings and mail in my room before the sidechick came over (the girlfriend lived there right before I moved in). I thought it was odd he expected me to go along with this when we&#x27;re still strangers getting to know each other. I also thought it was odd how he would barely tell me when she was coming over and then had her staying entire weekends or days at a time, and this continued even after he moved out and the lease was transferred over to me. He asked to move back in and brought the sidechick with him for the whole weekend and didn&#x27;t say shit. Like huh? He would also want me to hang out with him and her and I was honestly uncomfortable. It&#x27;s bad enough he&#x27;s been a terrible roomate, but now I&#x27;m <mark>forced</mark> to go along with your lies and have to constantly look at your sidechick in my apartment that I pay majority of the bills in?

Y&#x27;all might think I sound crazy but I let all of this go on for several reasons. 

He didn&#x27;t know me but let me move in no strings attached. Even after I moved in he paid all the bills (I was told to only pay my portion of the rent). He&#x27;s traumatized from his childhood and experiences in the military. He&#x27;s very aware that he&#x27;s an alcoholic and a terrible relationship partner and he knows he&#x27;s just trying to fill a Void. He has a daughter from a previous marriage that he doesn&#x27;t take care of. He feels bad about it. I don&#x27;t have kids but we did alot of trauma bonding so I sympathized with him and I just ignored alot of the red flags. 

One morning he texted me around 7AM asking could he come in (this was after he had moved out). Apparently his sidechick dropped him off because he drove his car over to our apartment complex for the weekend and they drove her car back to her place. He comes in and he&#x27;s in the middle of a panic attack (probably going through withdrawals from trying to stop drinking). I sit with him on the couch all day until it passes and he asks if he could move back in. I was fine with it  (not really but I felt bad for the guy) 

After he moved in he fell back into the same bad habits and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. We spoke very early one Friday morning because he decided we should start texting each other our plans. He told me he was going to his sidechick&#x27;s place for the weekend and the place was all mine. He was very specific about what time he&#x27;d be gone etc. So I get home around 3pm and he&#x27;s just stumbling out of his room hungover obviously. Him and the sidechick are still there. At this point I&#x27;m annoyed because I made plans and was gonna have company over. I ask him back to back about 3 times what are his plans because he said he&#x27;d be gone, and he&#x27;s like &quot;idk. I think we&#x27;re gonna go to a bar. Let&#x27;s go out&quot;. In my mind in just like whatever so I decide to go out. 

We go out to a bar and go to the balcony. He disappears and leaves me alone with the sidechick (bad idea!). I&#x27;ve already told him to stop doing this because she starts asking me about other women and what he&#x27;s doing. This time it&#x27;s really bad though because I was high. I&#x27;m already a pretty honest person but I&#x27;m guaranteed to tell the truth when I&#x27;m under the influence of anything. I didn&#x27;t really say anything crazy but at some point we end up back inside and he tells me I&#x27;m instigating. Then he randomly says they closed his tab and we have to leave. I&#x27;m confused and pissed off. So we go back home and I&#x27;m trying to talk to him but he&#x27;s kinda <mark>blow</mark>ing me off. In my mind I&#x27;m thinking I did something to possibly get us kicked out because I was high but later that night I drove back to the bar and asked the bartender what happened. He told me my roomate was ordering shots, Jamesons, knocking things over etc and he said he closed his tab because he wasn&#x27;t gonna serve him anymore alcohol. 

At this point I&#x27;m pissed off because he had us go back home because they wouldn&#x27;t serve him anymore alcohol... really???? You had me and your sidechick sitting on the balcony n the freezing cold while you were inside the bar getting <mark>drunk</mark>... alone? 

I sent him a text explaining what I was told by the bartender and he gets combative. He started screaming at me and says I&#x27;m gaslighting him and the sidechick. I find this hilarious as I&#x27;ve been helping him lie and cheat on this girl for MONTHS.

At some point we get into a wrestling match and immediately after he says &quot;I&#x27;ll be gone by the end of the week&quot;. He leaves right after with the sidechick and his dog. I immediately start packing all of his shit and put it in the living room. I guess he came back in the morning and saw all his stuff packed so he left and came back with his best friend and the sidechick and they moved his stuff. We didn&#x27;t speak at all. He blocked me on Instagram and I unfriended him on Tik Tok. It&#x27;s been 2 months and we haven&#x27;t spoken. 

Should I feel bad? 

I&#x27;m not sure who actually touched who first but to me it was just another night of having to deal with one of his <mark>drunk</mark>en outbursts and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I&#x27;ve been so good to this guy, his dog and his sidechick despite him being a shitty roomate and shitty friend to me.

I took care of a violent 32 year old <mark>drunk</mark> and his dog for months, help him lie and keep secrets from his sidechick, take care of the house, take care him of when he&#x27;s blackout <mark>drunk</mark>, cleaning him up when he&#x27;s throwing up on himself etc etc. I mean it was insane. 

And now I&#x27;m being treated like I&#x27;m the villain.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Apologies in advance for the wall of text. A lot of detail I feel the need to get off my chest.

My ex (28f) and I (31m) had been dating for over 4 years, and lived together for 3 years. For most of our relationship, she was in grad school, and we had just moved to a new city together after she graduated. Last year in June, she was diagnosed with a low grade 2 brain tumor in the back of her head. She got surgery to remove it in August which was only supposed to impact vision and balance mildly. The recovery period was 6-8 weeks with minimal forecasted implications. 

Immediately after the operation, thing seemed fine and it was successful. 2 weeks into the recovery, she began to sleep less and less and became increasingly irritable. I was her primary caretaker as we both had just moved to a new city and were far from friends and family. She began to treat me with increasing disdain and became extremely short tempered. I became frustrated as I was trying to take care of her needs-- walk our dogs, turn down the lights to her preference, make her food, etc-- only to be reprimanded for not being fast enough or getting in her way. I dismissed it as a side effect of drugs/recovery/etc.

One day about 3 weeks into recovery, she got mad at me for responding to her in a monotone way regarding something mundane (turning off the fans in the bathroom because of the noise). She locked herself in the bathroom and came out with a 5 page letter breaking up with me, without stating any detail about why in the letter. Mostly full of I love yous and I care about you, but this isn&#x27;t working and we need to end things. She told me I had to move out of our apartment and she would buy all my furniture, since I furnished the apartment when we first moved in. She could not afford to do this yet insisted on it, despite being only a few weeks into brain surgery recovery and clearly needing someone to be there to physically care for her.

She had not slept for 3 full nights prior to this happening. She stayed up all night scrolling on social media, buying things off the internet, and obsessively doing other things of that nature. She started a new instagram account as she had delusions that God had told her to reach out to people as an influencer and help them. She would ignore my pleas to tell her to try to get sleep, as she was confident it was good for her recovery for her brain to &quot;stay active&quot; by scrolling on her phone all night. She worked in healthcare as a PA so in her delusional state, she was supremely overconfident that she knew how to take care of herself, that nothing was wrong.

I was in shock upon the breakup. I did not know how to respond or why it was happening. I told her she wasn&#x27;t well and needed to rest. I told her she wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly. She was in brain surgery recovery, she couldn&#x27;t be alone at this time. She was making extremely self destructive decisions with the arrogance that she knew what she was doing. None of this was rational and she would refuse to speak about it. She became extremely emotionally abusive and toxic, completely irrational, and entirely unstable.

She could not afford our 2 bedroom apartment by herself, yet insisted that I leave and she would take over the lease. She barely had any savings and had significant student loans/medical bills incoming. She spent thousands of dollars on trinkets online in only a matter of days. Huge packages of random stuff came to our door multiple times a day. It freaked me out, she was financially ruining us/herself. She became mad at her employer for irrational reasons, and texted coworkers she would not return to work, despite obviously needing the income and insurance for her medical care. She became angry with her medical providers for not giving her meds that she insisted she needed, and was confident she knew more about medicine than them. She cut off her friends and family, and would refuse to speak to anyone in detail about her condition. Her parents were divorced and she already had little contact with either of them, so she was not close to family to begin with, which did not help the situation. She broke up with me yet still acted like nothing happened, alternating between yelling at me for not being there for her and insisting that I leave and I wasn&#x27;t respecting her needs/listening to her. She started posting the most manic and erratic rants on her new instagram account, literally hundreds of reels over the course of a single night. She refused to believe anything was wrong and refused to get any serious medical care or evaluations. She simply said &quot; just need some time to heal&quot;. When I followed her to her routine medical followups, she insisted to the doctors nothing was wrong and she was &quot;just going through a hard time&quot;. I had to sneak out after the meetings to talk to the providers about her condition, or take the phone from her and speak to them in another room. The doctors said there shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong, they didn&#x27;t touch any part of the brain that would affect personality. A psychologist thought this was just a psychological trauma response. They all said to just wait and see if it gets better. I did not know what to do, or how to get her help. Apparently I just had to wait it out. 

A few days later, she told me she &quot;changed her mind&quot; about the breakup, but still talked and acted very abusive towards me and insisted I leave to find another apartment. She said &quot;we just need space&quot; and woudn&#x27;t give any detail other than that. I kept reasoning with her that she couldn&#x27;t afford our apartment, I asked her if we&#x27;re not breaking up why did I need to leave? I told her not to quit her job, but she kept saying she&#x27;d be fine, don&#x27;t worry about her. She wasn&#x27;t even cleared to drive or lift any weight. It didn&#x27;t make sense. She refused to talk about why, shutting me down and yelling at me for even asking. I had been staying up every night trying to get her to sleep, and she would become extremely abusive and yell at me if I tried to guide her to bed or try to tell her she wasn&#x27;t ok. In doing this, I wasn&#x27;t <mark>sleeping</mark> or eating or working, I was spending all day on the phone trying to reach out to doctors and friends and family and trying to calm her down. I was malnourished and sleep deprived, and extremely worried about her well being. I saw her completely destroying everything we had built together and was scared to see her behave this way.

It was clear she was in a full fledged manic/psychotic episode-- She was spending money she didn&#x27;t have, she spent all day hanging things on the walls and told me she was communicating to me via patterns and hidden messages. It was very scary to hear her talk this way, as she was fine only a few weeks before this. She would treat me like trash and would only be somewhat ok if I played along with her manic delusions. Keep in mind this was after breaking up with me as well, so I was in emotional turmoil on top of worrying about her wellbeing. She made me support her in her manic behavior, or else I would be punished. She would gaslight me and tell me I was being manipulative if I told her she wasn&#x27;t OK. I started to lose my own mind dealing with her.

Within a few days, things boiled over. I was tired of being abused and treated like shit, despite doing my best to take care of my clearly psychological damaged girlfriend. As I tried to get a bit of sleep, she would wake me up yelling at me to leave and find another apartment, only to change her mind and then tell me I could stay, only to then yell at me for not leaving later in the day. I couldn&#x27;t win no matter if I listened to her or not. Eventually, I told her I would leave. This broke my heart, I did not want to leave her like this but she <mark>forced</mark> me to. She would not listen to any of my pleas and would not listen to anyone about her mental state. I cried and begged but she just laughed and brushed it off. So I signed another apartment lease. I was still in shock, I knew she wasn&#x27;t well, but I just needed to get away. I was so worried about her, yet I couldn&#x27;t bear to be around her any more. 

I spent a week moving my stuff out, leaving her pretty much all the furniture as I knew she wasn&#x27;t well and couldn&#x27;t afford new stuff. I played along with her delusions until I got my stuff out, because I was afraid she would lock me out or <mark>blow</mark> up again and do something drastic. I told myself this relationship is over, but in the back of my mind I was hoping maybe she would calm down within a few weeks, and maybe we could figure out what happened, as severe as her actions were. 

After I moved out, she acted like we were still together. She said we could spend weekends at each other&#x27;s places. I was in disbelief. She had broken up with me for no reason, made me move out despite us living together for 3 years, treated me like shit the whole time, and now is pretending nothing had happened. We were planning to get married and buy a house before this. I did not see this as some trivial incident, it was basically the end of our relationship. I did not know how to respond, I just knew I needed to get away from the abuse and gaslighting. I spent weeks rebuilding my apartment, as I had to re-buy every bit of furniture that I had left for her.

After I moved out, I was struggling between wanting to check in on her and trying to emotionally recover from the incident. She started acting even more erratically, alternating between sending me memes and asking me to watch TV with her, to blocking me on text and saying we need to move on. I found out from a mutual friend that she started seeing someone else from Tinder about 2 weeks after I moved out, and that she was behaving even more manically. She blocked me on everything except email, wouldn&#x27;t let me get the remainder of my belongings, and sent me an email demanding money from me, despite me leaving her all my furniture and paying for most things throughout our relationship (she was in school, I had a stable job throughout). I was offended to say the least. How could she break up with me, kick me out of our apartment, start hooking up with someone else, then demand money from me? I owed her nothing. I had given her so much already only to be tossed aside in a fit of mental illness.

I completely cut her off after that, extremely angry and confused and hurt at what had just happened. I spent most of that time just trying to take care of my basic physical needs and rebuilding my home that I had left behind. It took me until about November, 2 months after moving out, before the grief and reality of what had just happened hit me. I was completely depressed after that. I started therapy, spent most of my time calling friends and coworkers and having anxiety attacks. I couldn&#x27;t even stand to be in my new apartment. We had moved to a new city together and now I was completely alone, with almost no friends here. I had spent all my time with her. I struggled to understand why we even broke up, what I did, or if she was OK. I alternated between hating her for her actions and feeling bad for her and wanting her back. I had been through breakups before, but this was such an unusual circumstance due to the medical condition. 

The only updates I got during this period were from when I checked in with a mutual friend. The friend said that my ex had gotten worse, started hallucinating demons in her bathroom, started hanging out in a witch cult, started believing in wild occult / mystical shit, doing a bunch of drugs, getting mad at friends who tried to check in. It was wild. I remember thinking &quot;wow I dodged a bullet, glad I got out when I did&quot;. I coped by basically pretending the girl I knew was dead, replaced by a psychotic demon who was a completely different person. After I heard these updates, it was easier to just villify her and pretend like she wasn&#x27;t there any more. 

Right before NYE, about 4 months after, she unblocked me and reached out to talk. Apparently she had become lucid again and started to realize what had happened. She said she gotten let go from her job (she threatened many times to quit). She spent tons of money taking trips and buying things and doing whatever manic people do. She wasn&#x27;t able to pay rent. She didn&#x27;t have insurance to get followup care. She had burned bridges with her closest friends, and had very few people to support her. Basically everything I had tried to prevent from happening, had happened. And she finally acknowledged that she wasn&#x27;t well and needed care. It was heartbreaking to hear her talk again like she was before the surgery.

I felt so bad. I had gotten to the point where I had thought I had started moving on, but to hear her talk like this again and for her to finally realize and acknowledge what had happened, it brought me right back. I told her I couldn&#x27;t help her, even though I wanted to. I had just spent 4 months trying to recover emotionally and move on, and I couldn&#x27;t do anything to save her from her fate. I told her she did this to herself and she hurt me, kicked me out, made me leave, and destroyed everything. All she said to that was that she was unwell and that I shouldn&#x27;t have left. She still blamed me for leaving her, even though she <mark>forced</mark> me to leave. 

The last time I spoke with her, she said she was moving back in with her mom across the country where we are both from. It&#x27;s now February, and although I have come to some level of acceptance of what happened, I am still alone, lost, and confused at how things went down. I feel a combination of grief, guilt, anger, loneliness, depression, and heartbreak. I don&#x27;t know why our relationship had to end. I don&#x27;t know if she will get better, if she will continue to have more psychotic episodes, or how she will manage to recover. She treated me so badly, yet I kept telling myself it wasn&#x27;t her fault. She was a good person before all this. I still have trouble reconciling this.

I don&#x27;t think we will ever be able to get back together again, but in my darkest moments I still fantasize that things will go back to normal, like before the brain surgery. I know this is not possible. She has dug herself into a deep deep financial hole, she will need medical treatment for the foreseeable future, and she may never be the same person again. She still seems to have some leftover delusional beliefs, and still isn&#x27;t completely accountable for how things went down. She still thinks that I have some blame in what had all happened, even though I tried everything I could to help. 

I am trying now to create a new life in the city that we had moved to together, but in the darkness of winter it has been isolating, cold, dark, and hard to move on. I don&#x27;t have a social circle here which makes it so much harder. I tell myself I wish I had a &quot;regular&quot; breakup, so at least I would have clarity and closure on what happened. I can&#x27;t hate her, I can&#x27;t blame her, even though I want to. There isn&#x27;t a simple narrative on why things ended, which causes me to ruminate on if things could have worked out differently. It just blew up in an intense bout of mental illness. Could I have stayed longer if I fought her? Could I have withstood the abuse longer? Would it have changed anything? I don&#x27;t know if she wants to get back together, and I don&#x27;t know if I would want to even if she did. I try not to contact her even though I want to. I tell myself I&#x27;m glad we weren&#x27;t married or had kids, because this would have been so much worse. But I still have trouble dealing with the trauma of all this. She didn&#x27;t deserve this. I didn&#x27;t deserve this. I feel like the psychosis permanently changed her mind and caused her to believe that we had to end the relationship. I try to forget about it and move on. But I feel the need to post about this. I&#x27;m the only person to witness what actually happened in person. I don&#x27;t know what she tells her friends and family, but this is what happened. I guess I&#x27;m looking for any words of encouragement, or anybody who has dealt with similar mental illness. It feels so unfair that it went down in this way.

*Any and all advice is welcome. I have yet to find a therapist that I clicked with.* 





This February I&#x27;ll be 29. This March It&#x27;ll be 8 years since my ex-fiancé and I split. Every single day, at least once, something reminds me of her. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything from therapy to entering serious relationships, but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to get over someone I was committed to spending the rest of my life with. I can&#x27;t figure it out.



The largest issue is my shallowness. This was what I mainly sought therapy for. This is something I&#x27;d like to change about myself. I am a very surface level person. I think this greatly stems from my career as a classical musician. It&#x27;s part of why I grievously hate the culture of classical music in general, but that is a whole different topic. Perfection is unfortunately real. I&#x27;ve seen it. I have a degree and a half training me to see it. It exists. In my world there is a bar that exists, and some people meet and exceed it, and others do not. Sure, there are subjective qualities to classical music, but those come secondary to hard, measurable, qualities that determine a musician&#x27;s proficiency. Some irksome professionals will wax poetic that these metrics are secondary and trivial and that music (read: emotive playing) comes above all else. This is demonstrably false. There are some bastions of the classical music world that don&#x27;t preach this lie (I got to see this firsthand when I lived and played in Germany), yet much of the western world preaches this as gospel. It&#x27;s simply not true and I&#x27;m tired of pretending it is. Perfection is real. And I had it.

My ex (C) was born in Osaka, Japan, to a professional American oboist and a professional Japanese violinist. She and her family all moved to America when she was young, but her Japanese heritage and upbringing heavily influenced her personality and work ethic. My ex is a very fine violinist and unfortunately this ability, ambition, work ethic, and talent of hers is extremely extremely attractive to me. We met when I was still in my undergrad at age 19 while she was 25. She was in a lackluster and sexless relationship, taking mediocre gigs, barely practicing, not taking auditions, and supporting herself and her deadbeat boyfriend with her office job. We met on a rather low paying gig, and I had never known what love at first sight was until then. From the moment she walked in (only 5 minutes or so before downbeat) she had such a power to her. A command of the room, despite her being rather dressed down. Her smile was huge and warm and everyone greeted her as she got set up in the front row. Immediately. Immediately I was enthralled. Immediately I knew this was someone I had to meet. 



During a break, I saw her sneak out the back door with her ax. Without a thought I followed. She was quietly (mute on) running scales and arpeggios with her back to the door. As she heard me open the door, she kind of looked back and smiled and resumed her practice, turning her back to me. We were playing Wagner and as any string player would know, it is just page upon page of scales and arpeggios for the entire string section. I stumbled over words and finally got out a line about how I couldn&#x27;t understand her doing more scales if that&#x27;s already what the whole concert was. She smiled and turned now, facing me squarely. My teeth are not pleasant, and I generally attempt to refrain from smiling when I&#x27;m trying to be attractive, but immediately her smile made me smile and look away. I became painfully aware that I was standing squarely in the middle of the doorway area, not looking cool or sly in the slightest. Just awkwardly watching her without any excuse for being there. As she faced me, I was struck: If you had asked me at a young age to describe my ideal woman, I would have described her to a T. Her physical beauty, her poise, her personality, her demeanor. Slightly messy curly hair, long and black in messy waves of a black low ponytail. Almond skin. Freckles. Perfectly slim without being too toned. Small frame. Small bust. Maybe three inches shorter than me. Slight midriff showing. Asian eyes and cheekbones, yet she opened her eyes wide as she spoke to me, intent on hearing what I had to say. Strong pointed chin. Big, huge, giant toothy quirky smile. Long, thin fingers. No nail polish. No make up. Non assuming fashion and humble presence, yet perfectly confident in herself and her ability. And even though I had yet to know it, her energy and passion, enough to make me fall in love day after day after day. I do not have the ability to describe a more perfect woman. I do not know how. 



It was at this point I realized she was speaking to me, and I had been too slack jawed to even register. I stumbled over a laugh and fell back on the international musician filler compliment, &quot;You sound great!&quot; Her lips pursed and her eyes widened, a face I would love seeing every single time over the next couple years. &quot;No I don&#x27;t! Not even close!&quot; Her humbleness was genuine. Despite her skill and confidence and knowledge of self-worth, she still and always will compare herself constantly to the great violinists in her life. I had years to analyze if her humbleness was legitimate, and it most certainly was. She knew she was good, but to compare her skill to true perfection, she knew her work would never be over. To walk that line, balancing between knowing that your work will never be done and knowing your worth... it&#x27;s an ability I feel even a majority of major symphony players have yet to figure out. 



My words were awkward, and I listlessly shifted weight from foot to foot until I finally rested against the wall. I don&#x27;t know of what we spoke, but my goal was just to make her smile and laugh as much as possible. And it worked. Eventually she inquired about my schooling and it turns out she worked at the same university I attended. We lived not even 3 miles from each other. And so it was decided. We would carpool to the rehearsals and the shows and maybe even grab some food together when there was time. I would meet her boyfriend and... oof. That word literally caused me a pain just below my belly button. I remember it exactly. a downward diagonal strike from below my belly button to my tailbone. I can still feel it in my hips if I think about it. The clapping from inside the hall signaled it was time to resume rehearsal and I expressed how happy I was to meet her and she just smiled as I held open the door for her. As she passed I noticed her hair was still slightly damp. Freshly showered, smelling like kiwi.

I was a drug dealer at the time. It&#x27;s how I paid my way through my undergrad, and eventually how I purchased my first professional instrument. It was handy gig work. Like musicians, dealers do not make a lot of money, but money-per-time-spent and picking where and when you work was an ideal career choice while pursuing professional musician appointments, teaching lessons, and being a full-time student. I enjoy using substances, but luckily for whatever reason, I lack the gene that elicits compulsive use. Only drug I&#x27;ve Ever had even an inkling of a dependence on was alcohol, and even then, when I decided I was developing a problem, I quickly put a stop to it. This made me a rather effective drug dealer, and I could carry harder substances without the fear of developing a habit, as well as always remaining on deck. (For the aspiring drug dealers in the audience, all you have to do to be prolific and outshine the competition is 1. not be sketchy/a dick, 2. be on time/don&#x27;t make people wait around on you, 3. have good quality shit OR have very cheap and readily available shit, and 4. always pick up the phone Thursday through Saturday nights. You master those things and you&#x27;ll never be want for customers.)  This made me quite a good friend to have in the music school and as well as with C, her boyfriend, and their friends. Soon I was hanging out with her and her boyfriend and friends every single weekend, then even often during the week. The three of us would go camping together, concerts, road trips, you name it. We had a solid friend group of 5 and we had a blast for about 4 months. 



I found that she would go to a certain spot in nature occasionally on her lunch break. 3 times a week EVERY week I would bust ass and sprint on my bike to get there and just &quot;happen&quot; to bump into her on the trail. It only ever worked 4 times, but damn. EVERY single week I tried and tried and tried just to spend a tiny bit more time with her. I was compelled.



C and my chemistry was steadily growing. Multiple times, I had caught her stalking me. She&#x27;d open her phone and it would be my social media, or a youtube video of my playing. It was becoming obvious in our friend group. Her boyfriend would suspiciously mention how much C and I had in common, with growing frequency. Her parents even were developing a soft spot for me and bought me a Christmas present. She and I went on a bike ride at night in late spring. I was 20 and she 26. We found a church with an outdoor playground and hopped the fence. Sitting on a pair of tractor tires, she looked me in the eyes and said, &quot;I think you like me.&quot; I played dumb and said of course. I&#x27;d never had a friend like her. &quot;No, I think you like-like me.&quot; I felt a hot flash and tears well in my eyes. She stared. Her brown eyes black in the moonlight. &quot;Who couldn&#x27;t, C, you&#x27;re perfect in every way.&quot; voice wavering, tears streaming down my cheeks. My face burning hot and a quiver in my body. She looked down and to the left and just said my name softly. Her eyes began to tear as well. I had been preparing for this conversation. I had already written my lines. I had just auditioned and won a fellowship at a summer music festival to be held in the summer. I told her how much her friendship meant to me. How much she filled my life with exactly what I was looking for. How I felt like I could breathe again. How she was the air in my lungs... And how I was going to get over all these feelings in those 10 weeks while I was at the festival. How, when I went away, it was my goal to burn all those feelings away. I reiterated through tears how much I loved her and her boyfriend and how I would never get in between two people I respected so much. This was half true. I didn&#x27;t think I deserved her. I didn&#x27;t think there was any world where I could date someone of such caliber. She was so warm to me, but her personality made it so she was warm to everyone. I wasn&#x27;t special, I thought. 



She remained silent, and we sat on those tires for maybe another 10 minutes. Letting the moon wash over us. Both of us quietly sobbing. Everything in my body told me to hug her and be close to her. Maybe even finally kiss her. But I knew better. I truly truly had no intention of homewrecking. I liked our friend group. Eventually we got up without a word and biked to her home together. It just so happened her boyfriend happened to be outside when we arrived. Suddenly she and I were chatting and smiling like nothing had happened. We hugged and I hugged her boyfriend, and I biked off without any suspicion. I cried the whole night.



We didn&#x27;t hangout much after that. The semester was wrapping up and both my school and her job were getting very time consuming. A close friend of mine OD&#x27;d so I was taking a break from the game. Focused on school and my sophomore year recital. I did throw an end of semester party where they made an appearance, although it was not for long, and they didn&#x27;t seem like they were especially having a good time. I was dancing close to a woman I&#x27;d be spending the night with, and I specifically remember seeing C leaving the bathroom, take one long look at us dancing together, then bee line for the outdoors where the weed was. They left shortly after that with a brief goodbye.

The festival was good. Up until this last year, I&#x27;d say in a lot of ways it was my best ensemble playing. I did have a fling there that I would have liked to continue, but we lived on opposite sides of the county, and I think she didn&#x27;t like me like I liked her. C and I had text conversations twice while I was there, just basic small talk. She asked for a picture, and I spent HOURS I should have spent practicing editing out the hickeys haha. Between my fling and my playing, I felt I was ready to move on when I came back. 



And when I did, C and her boyfriend picked me up from the airport. The energy was... off. Oddly silent. We went to a grocery store where C ran in to grab some beer while her boyfriend and I stayed in the car. &quot;C... really seems to like you... she sure seemed excited you were coming back...&quot; he said pointedly. I responded truthfully that I was happy to see them both and that it was too bad that we hadn&#x27;t been able to hang in so long. Nothing else was said between us. C returned with the beer, and we went to their house. Things were in disarray, not to the point that needed comment, but I could tell that something was not right. We smoked a bit, drank a bit, watched a concert on youtube and things seemed fine-ish. I left to go meet with another friend of theirs (and now mine), J.



Halfway into a joint, J quickly confessed that C and her boyfriend were having problems about me. Silently inside I screamed with joy. I chose my words carefully expressing this isn&#x27;t what I wanted for either of them, but J knew I was concealing my true emotions. C had told J about our conversation in the church playground. It had been almost 4 months since then. C had told J that she felt the same about me that I did about her. Apparently, C had brought me up repeatedly while I was at the festival and  the subtlety of her feelings was all but gone. My heartbeat steadily rose. I remember my palms sweating and my breath ragged. Maybe it was just the weed (I never was crazy about it) but I was experiencing something of an attack. J severely lacked in perception so she didn&#x27;t much notice hahaha. We finished the joint, but I left soon after. I remember laying in bed that night staring at the white popcorn ceiling. Wondering if this could be the woman I marry. Wondering if I really could be so lucky. 



Not even a week later, C showed up at my door unannounced on a Sunday afternoon. She had been crying, and her hair was a beautiful, tangled mess. First words out of her mouth were that she broke up with her boyfriend. I acted shocked and invited her inside. I began rolling a joint and asked if I had anything to do with it. She didn&#x27;t answer. We went to my patio and I expressed it was fine weather to lay in the hammock. She agreed and as soon as I had sat in it she came and sat in the hammock as well. I opened my mouth and drew a breath to (fake) object, but that sweet kiwi sent of her shampoo immediately hit me. I took the joint out from behind my ear and began to lay down and without a word she did as well, nestling her face and all that matted hair half in my armpit and half on my shoulder and chest. I was on my back and she was on her side facing me, her legs slightly straddling mine. My arm was in a position to be around her shoulders, but I didn&#x27;t want to over step so it just floated awkwardly against the hammock above her head. I felt like my heart was going to give me away, especially with how close her ears were to my chest. I couldn&#x27;t expose the literal thousands of times I had thought of this exact scenario. She peered up at me with one eye, the other trapped in my armpit. I half laughed, and she just kept staring. Wordless. I twisted my neck to go for the kiss and the second I couldn&#x27;t reach to make the connection, she quickly raised her head to mine. Soft. Only a touch of tongue. Respectful. Slow. She flushed a shade of red and her eyes narrowed, the same face she&#x27;d made while focusing on practicing. I remember her eyes flitting from mine, to my lips, then back to my eyes again. We shared another, again soft and respectful, almost a bit forcefully reserved. A little too quickly she pulled her head down back to my armpit and reached her arm around me, pulling me tight. I felt her body heave with quiet tears. After a minute she said, &quot;Your lips are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt.&quot;

  


\*\*\*



I won&#x27;t bore you with too many details of our love making but know that perfect sex does exist. It&#x27;s out there. It&#x27;s real. That first night she dug her nails so hard into my back I bled the whole next day, my shirt snagging on the scabs and reopening our passion. I still have a scar from a bite and rip so deep on my chest that I wondered if one day she&#x27;d kill me mid coitus. Even holding her down she&#x27;d kick and rip and scratch and tear. A wild deadly animal in my bed. We put a quarter sized hole in the wall from banging the bedpost repeatedly. During an especially fast and passionate round we rolled off the bed, her head striking the tile floor. Hard. I pulled out and started asking if she was ok. She dug her nails back into the openings on my love handles and hissed 3 words that I still masturbate to the memory of. &quot;Keep. Fucking. Me.&quot; 



And it kept up too. I don&#x27;t know how else to say it. It kept up this way. I would bleed through shirts. I had to always wear a coat as my dress shirts were now all flecked with the red brown of dried blood. For months this violent passion. This death-sex. She would show up at my door on lunch breaks for 20 violent minutes of animalistic fucking, finish me in her mouth, then literally run back to her car to drive to work and clock back in. Cum still crusted on her chin. I was skipping class to find her at her office, and she&#x27;d take a break, and we&#x27;d fuck in the private handicapped bathroom. Sometimes we&#x27;d stop mid sex just to cry about how amazingly in love we were and how we wasted so much of our lives without each other. 



Our friends multiple times had to have a talk with us about our public affection. We couldn&#x27;t help it. Whether we were cooking, cleaning, eating, you name it. We had to be near one another. C would demand that whenever we were bringing in something like groceries that I only fill one arm with bags so that I could &quot;carry her hand&quot; as we walked from the car to the house. We were inseparable. Glued. Infatuated. 



The story gets boring here. C got a storage unit and started <mark>sleeping</mark> in J&#x27;s spare room flat on the ground with a thin <mark>sleeping</mark> pad (damn Japanese traditions). We would destroy each other every single night. She claimed that The Pill made her dry up, so quickly we started stocking up on Plan B. (It&#x27;s the same drug; shouldn&#x27;t the Plan B  have made her dry up too? It sure didn&#x27;t!) We found we could get 3 days&#x27; worth of fucking per 1 pill. Didn&#x27;t matter that I was barely dealing and had next to no money, I shelled out for those pills like they were my lifeblood. Though her finishing me with her mouth was amazing in every way, there is no better a connection than filling her, and plus when I didn&#x27;t have to play the pull out game, I could go fast and consistent enough to make her finish. The things we did in J&#x27;s spare room… God damn. Not a day goes by. Not a single day goes by that I don&#x27;t think about it. The anger and passion and rage and obsession and violence and blood and fire and deep insatiable need. I thought I would die in that room, and I was ready. Anything to feel that way forever. We were so god damn alive. 



Sheepishly and shyly, one night she asked me. She asked quietly in my room staring up at me while I half lay on top of her, hearts still beating in our throats from our sex. &quot;Do... Would you... would you want to maybe spend the rest of your life with me?&quot; I was completely shocked and kind of laughed it off. But she was serious. &quot;I&#x27;m crazy about you \[my name\]. I think I want to spend my life with you, \[my name\] ...&quot; The air was caught in my throat. I sat up and she squirmed her legs out from under me. I sat there slack jawed, her naked body moving in the dim lighting, rummaging through her bag. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to ever be without you, \[my name\]&quot; and she pulled a simple black square box out of her bag. She opened it. A simple golden band. no frills, no design. A simple shining band between our naked bodies. &quot;Be with me, \[my name\], for the rest of my life&quot; and I immediately said yes. I didn&#x27;t even mean to. and I said yes. Those words are burned. Branded into my brain. I can hear her voice exactly, the pitch and tone, the softness, the shy fear. I hear those words all the damn time like a ghost in my ear. The ring didn&#x27;t fit me and I had to wear it on my pinky. No celebration. No anything. Just our bodies as close as possible sharing heat and tears all night. 



And 4 months later she left for a large city about 7 hours away. I&#x27;d filled her with life, and she quit her job to pursue music full time. She had a sister out there and she&#x27;d live with her, help take some of her sister&#x27;s students, practice and audition like crazy, and she&#x27;d find a life out there. Our sex was filled with more tears than ever. But we knew she&#x27;d visit me. And believe it or not she did. She still got a decent amount of gigs out here and I&#x27;d see her 1-2 weekends a month. We would Facetime and practice together. We would do our morning and evening exercise routines together. We&#x27;d fall asleep on the phone. And our love stayed strong. Every vacation I&#x27;d fly out there and fly back, barely making it in time for class. Our sex was as burning as ever, although we did tone the violence down somewhat by necessity. We would not have been presentable if we kept that up haha. Our plan B budget luckily was able to shrink to 1-2 per visit. Sure there was plenty of jealousy, C was an extremely attractive woman trying to make friends in a new and exciting city, but one of my favorite attributes about C is that she was incapable of lying. This definitely screwed us over a few times, times it would have been best to lie to her work or her family, (&quot;Sorry Grandma, but \[my name\] and I had sex and I NEED to get to Walgreens to get Plan B&quot; I will never forget her grandma&#x27;s complete stunned silence) but ultimately her inability to effectively lie was one of the best things about her. When she said there was nothing between her and so-and-so, I believed her. It is the only way our long-distance thing worked. 

  


\*\*\*

  


And so this went on. For about a year. And that&#x27;s when I got stupid. My single greatest mistake of my entire life. I overestimated my musical ability. I overestimated my work ethic. I underestimated just how good I had it. And now I get to pay the price for the rest of my damn life apparently. I will suffer for this for the rest of my goddamn life. 



C won a professional job. Not a full-time orchestra, but a bigish one. One that would definitely pay the bills. between that and teaching and other gigs, she&#x27;d be just fine. Big problem, it was in a city I hated. And I... I listened to my music professors. I&#x27;m shaking my head as I type this. How could I have been so egotistical to be lulled into this. How. I knew I was making a mistake and I just let it happen. My professors said I had something. I got a cushy teaching assistant-ship at a school I wanted to do my masters at way out in the middle of nowhere. The university has a good program and the professor of my instrument is truly in the top 20 currently alive. But, it was in the middle of nowhere. And they offered me so much money, man. So much more than any other school I auditioned for. And they said &quot;hey the classes you teach? teach them your way. You make the syllabus. You make the test. You have carte blanche. Here is your budget.&quot; and that SPOKE to me, man. That spoke to me. And not to mention that I played for a small-time symphony director in the area and I was guaranteed the spot in his group. It felt like something to me. I valued it. 



C knew I wasn&#x27;t going with her to that city I hated. And I knew C wasn&#x27;t coming with me to this Podunk town where I was going to do my masters. Our visits were more crying than anything else now. Crying and holding and crying and holding. A couple weeks after my 21st birthday, C visited me. For the first time ever. EVER. When I reached out to touch her, she recoiled. I knew within the first minute of seeing her that she had been unfaithful. 



You might not believe me, and maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t think that would have happened if we weren&#x27;t destined to break up regardless. If I had chosen right. If I had not been a fucking idiot and known that no career was worth me giving us up. How could I. How could I have been so fucking stupid. If I had gone with her, I honestly. Fully. Don&#x27;t think she would have been unfaithful. Our love was still burning. Our sex was still mind-<mark>blow</mark>ing. We hadn&#x27;t lost even an iota of the spark. She did it because there was no other way for us to break up. We couldn&#x27;t keep living this way, not as sexual and physical beings that we were. 7 hours was already too far. no way we could last opposite sides of the country. We had talked about breaking up so many times, but it was impossible. Impossible. She had to do this. For us. Tell me I&#x27;m wrong. I&#x27;m begging you. Tell me some way to make me believe this. I know if I were in your shoes I&#x27;d think the same thing, &quot;he&#x27;s just making excuses.&quot; But I just don&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t know how. I don&#x27;t know how. She had no reason to cheat. And she said it herself. She didn&#x27;t want for anything physical. She didn&#x27;t want for anything emotional. Even for the painful month after that when we tortured ourselves again and again, unable to stop seeing each other, angry-in-the-bad-way sex, spiteful sad sex, we still had a complete emotional connection. She cheated because she had to. I don&#x27;t know how to believe otherwise. 



A year passed. I flew to spend a couple weeks with her. I was a mess. I looked a mess. I was fitter than ever, but my life was not in a good place. The spark was not there. I was sick and my coughing annoyed her. I had grown my hair in a way she always wanted but it didn&#x27;t look good on me. We spent as much time as possible fucked up. The sex was bad. No spark. I had trouble staying hard. She threw a party and in a coke and alcohol fueled rage I beat this guy she had been seeing. Nothing too bad, but he (maybe accidentally) went in for a kiss on her. She denied him and I grabbed the back of his head and bashed his face in on the booze table until he stopped standing and just kinda slumped underneath the table. The party resumed (Coke is good at making the party keep going) and she ended up spending a decent amount of the party taking care of him. The same way she used to look at me, was how she looked at him. The next morning after a night of almost decent sex, C and I drove him home. His face was still all bloodied and his lips split. I get a sick pleasure out of knowing that he is/was an oboe player and he had a gig later that day. I hope he biffed it. All these years later and I still feel that anger this very moment.



A couple months passed, and she came to visit me. She tried to back out so many times. But I couldn&#x27;t let it happen. I needed this. I needed to undo the fuck ups that were the last visit. It was more of the same. still couldn&#x27;t get hard much. Weird dispassionate sex. I was still a mess and C would find any excuse she could to be pissy with me. When I dropped her off at the airport, she barely even gave me a hug goodbye. Just a quick, check the box, 2 second hug, and she was on her way. Couldn&#x27;t be happier to be rid of me. She later apologized for that but who cares. 

  


\*\*\*

  


And that was that. I fell into a deep depression. Covid hit and I didn&#x27;t even finish my masters. Biffed an audition so bad I quit playing and fucked off and spent 3 years living abroad. I&#x27;ve had 3 serious relationships since then and I feel so bad. So so bad to commit to someone whom I just don&#x27;t feel anything for. I&#x27;ve had someone obsessed with me. OBSESSED with me. She&#x27;d stalk me. &quot;Bump into me&quot; at the grocery store. I broke up with her 4 times and she just wouldn&#x27;t let it happen. I was everything to her and I just couldn&#x27;t feel the same way. I just couldn&#x27;t. I unfortunately did end up telling her I loved her, and we did date seriously for about 6 months after 8 months of situationship. And when I left the country, we still remained very very close. Very close. Video chat more days than not, close. I needed to cut her off but I didn&#x27;t. In a really cruel twist which I still don&#x27;t understand the odds of, somehow she stumbled onto the porn I was making in my new country. Was she looking for it? Impossible, right? My identity wasn&#x27;t in it, there were no tags or revealing details. Somehow she recognized my tattoos and watched every damn video of me with other women in my new country. She&#x27;s actually still subscribed to my OF despite us not talking in over 3 years now. She came to visit me in my current country and there definitely was a spark, but she was no C. No C at all. I watch the porn we made together and it&#x27;s good. There&#x27;s fire. But she was no C. I went no contact with her soon after her visit. The 5th and final breakup. I was too shallow. She didn&#x27;t have the looks or the body or the career accomplishments (but she was 20 so what accomplishments should I have expected her to have??) and she wasn&#x27;t a musician and didn&#x27;t respect her. And God I wish I could go back and at least break it off sooner, if not make it work. I reiterate, I wasn&#x27;t entirely the bad guy. She made breaking up damn near impossible. She would not take my breaking up seriously at all and would kinda just proceed as if I didn&#x27;t express that and ignore that I was seeing other women. She deserved better, which I think she has now. I would never inject my broken ass selfish self beck into her life no matter how much I wish I could go back, because I KNOW she deserves better. 



I bring all this up to say that the &quot;well you just gotta get in a new relationship, man&quot; advice has not worked for me. I have slept with over 100 people now. Women, Men, everything else, group sex, older, younger, I&#x27;ve even fucked on stage at a sex club in Silom, Bangkok. BDSM, drugs, I&#x27;ve been beaten by and beaten my partner, had cigarettes put out on me, tried sex on meth/mdma/ghb/ketamine. I&#x27;ve been a sugarbaby for some old ladies who would pass me around, and I&#x27;ve even hired a sex worker once. And I feel nothing. Nothing at all. I&#x27;m empty. a hollow shell. The blood is packed in my veins like ice. I&#x27;m frozen. I pretend to have emotions. I pretend to get excited about things. I pretend to be attracted and interested in people. But I feel nothing. Hollow empty shell.



Since I got deported from Germany (long story), I&#x27;ve been back in my hometown. About a year and a half now. I was prescribed antidepressants years ago, but I never filled the prescription. I&#x27;m on them now, and they help... but mostly just the day to day. Getting out of bed, getting to the gym, eating right. I&#x27;ve had sex 3 times and a bender (4 partners) in the last year and a half, and the sex has been terrible. just vapid fucking. grey and lifeless. A woman flew to visit me 2 weekends ago from that Podunk town I tried to get my masters in. For 4 days we fucked every morning and night. We had somewhat of a connection for a time back in that horrible town, but now like everything else. Grey, boring, hardly even hard. I feel bad for her because she still feels a connection to me, but I don&#x27;t feel anything. Nothing. 

  


\*\*\*

  


My takeaways are that unfortunately I met C at a very vulnerable part in my life. I&#x27;d only had sex with 5 people. She represented everything I wanted to be. She represented the life that I wanted. I was young, and she was as sex starved as one can be. We got lucky and like a drug were exactly feeding each other&#x27;s infatuation. We fit like a glove. I cannot expect this from a future partner. Easy to say, but hard to accept. That part of my life is over. The dealing, the parties, the sex, all that is over and I can&#x27;t go back, and I need to say that that is ok. I need to pretend I love this growth for me. I need to learn to find joy in other facets of life... somehow. It just so happened that my relationship with C ended exactly as my youth was ending and having to lose both at the same time has not been kind to me. 5 months ago, I went on a date with a woman in her mid 30s. And she was a corpse. Where did the life go? Drained out of her. Couldn&#x27;t possibly be more of a character foil for C. It is a shame she was so so beautiful. Took good care of herself. A brilliant violinist. But she wasn&#x27;t really there. And I see that in myself. I see my eyes hollowing. Despite me being fat right now, the hollowness on the inside is having its effect on the outside. My eyes have bags despite me <mark>sleeping</mark> plenty. My lips are thin. My cheeks hollow. My skin is a shade of white that it has never been before. The sex was so lifeless with that 30-something and I just can&#x27;t stand to think that that is going to be me soon if I don&#x27;t fix myself. I need to fix myself, and I just don&#x27;t know how. 



I find some solace in the fact that C is quite rotund now. Like her sister, she appears to be enjoying the finer things in life to a bit of excess. Her boyfriend, also letting himself go, is a very good percussionist, but you can see the lack of chemistry in their pictures. The awkward holding. The <mark>forced</mark> smiles. It was C&#x27;s dream to be married before 30 and now, 10 years since I met her, seeing her still unwed at coming up on 35 does bring a smile to my face. The woman I loved is dead and buried. And that brings me to a conflicted point in my life. If I was a betting man, I bet we would have had a divorce as soon as the infatuation wore off. But it might have still been worth it, for just a few more years of my life as the happiest person I could possibly be. The pain and ache of the divorce might have just been worth a few more moments with that woman. A few more minutes of being the person I was born to be. But it is what it is. It&#x27;s like watching a movie and believing its real and waiting for all that amazing stuff to happen to you. I got to live the beginning of that movie. That perfect life. But I don&#x27;t think it was real. I was living a lie and I just had yet to understand it. I had yet to realize it was all the most beautiful mirage I ever could have imagined. But this helps me very little. At least with her, I had a dream of the perfect infatuated life. At least I felt something. Now, I don&#x27;t even have that hope. Just a blind drift forward. To nothing. So the illusion is dead, so what? At least I used to have hope. 



Soooo what the fuck am I going to do. What the fuck am I going to do. All I can hope for is that I focus on my music career (which is taking off, somewhat) and somehow that puts me in a position to find someone I really care for. Someone whom I respect. Someone I could feel lucky to be with. I think rescuing someone from a sexless relationship would also be a good thing to be aware of. I think that fire and energy built and waiting for release can be the perfect catalyst to supply enough energy to power through the difficulties of commitment at the beginning of a relationship. Just enough energy to steamroll into a marriage. &quot;No one fucks like they do straight out of prison.&quot; - my friend who spent 4 years in prison. It would also be ideal to build up a love for someone over time. The kiss thought about 1000 times is 1000 times as sweet. If I could capture both these circumstances again, I just might be able to pull off another amazing relationship.



I&#x27;m balding, and at the moment I&#x27;m about 40 pounds overweight (this is new and temporary, I was running half marathons 5 months ago and then I got sick) so I have some things to work on, but maybe if I keep practicing and get myself a damn job, maybe, just maybe, there is a future for myself out there. I need to get my head right. It’s been 8 years. I need to get my head right. It&#x27;s time. Maybe I do deserve a wife and kid. Maybe I can learn to love someone not in the same way I loved C, but in a special way. Something special to me and her that I&#x27;ve never had with anyone else. Maybe it&#x27;s out there. 

  
  


Or maybe I&#x27;ll just die alone.

            <div class="content collapsed">this is really hard, my whole life i’ve never told anyone the full truth. to be honest, this is gonna be all over the place because there are about 93784684 things happening in my head right now
but i just need someone to listen, i need someone to hear this. i have an extremely complicated relationship with my family, my parents are coptic orthodox christian from egypt, who migrated to england. i, 17F was born here and have lived here my whole life. growing up so much stuff religion and culture wise was <mark>forced</mark> onto me and it contradicted the environment i was growing up in, all the children at school and anyone i interacted with outside my family had a completely different style of life which i grew more accustomed to. i think i’ve always had doubts about God but it’s a huge part of me and part of my roots but i just can’t agree with so much of the social expectations of the coptic community. everything took a turn for the worse when i discovered my sexuality when i was 13. it was so fucking hard and scary navigating everything while living with people and in a culture where it was heavily looked down upon and disapproved of. i started to dress more alternative, constantly wearing black and touching into more a edgy style. this is when i started hating going to church. every sunday i’d go and attend a service for 2 hours that i would find impossible to sit through surrounded by people who looked nothing like me, and would look at me differently just for dressing in a way that isn’t heard of amongst copts. i started to become heavily depressed and would think about suicide every single day. i still do sometimes. i would self-harm almost every day and cry myself to sleep every night. at 15 i was hospitalised for my mental health but i got medicated and am feeling much better now, but there’s so much unresolved trauma affecting me even until now. i’ve grown a lot since then, and now i know what i want in life - which i’ll speak about later. 

let’s talk about my dad. i’m going fucking crazy because i don’t know if i should hate him or not. my dad always provides for me financially, always giving me material things when i ask for them. emotionally there is nothing between us. he’s extremely emotionally and verbally abusive. every time i hear his raised voice across the house i tense up and get overwhelmed with fear - anytime he’s arguing with someone, it becomes everyone’s problem and anyone can be a victim to his outbursts. when i was younger he used to hit me and my brother as some sort of “discipline” i guess, but the shouting and screaming never stopped. i’m in a fucking loop where we bicker and then out of nowhere he’ll <mark>blow</mark> up, start swinging at me and throwing things. almost every time he’ll break something, whether it be a tv remote or just anything he can get his hands on. a year ago or so, he threw my brother’s pc down the stairs, shattering it. he never apologises. ever. my mother constantly takes his side, and i’m expected to apologise for driving him to the point of acting like that. and when he says something that upsets me, and i do something like give him the silent treatment, i’m the bad person. which is so fucking invalidating because in his eyes, my feelings are never justified. it’s so fucking scary sometimes, i can’t handle being anywhere where people raise their voices and my self-esteem is at rock bottom due to him constantly berating me. i’ve been as young as 8, sobbing, while he screams and punches doors telling me about how he despises his life because of me and how i’m a selfish, evil person. 

lets flash forward to today. i turn 18 next week and my whole life i’ve wanted to get a tattoo. my favourite game is the last of us, which i’m super emotionally attached to. in the darkest times of my life that was the one thing getting me by, when the whole world felt like it was collapsing on me. i really wanted to get ellie’s tattoo but that was an immediate no. one thing about my dad is he likes control. every little fucking aspect of my life is dictated by him and only him - my mother had no say and i absolutely do not have any say. instead i decided to get something else which they may be okay with. all night i’ve been pleading my dad that i really want a quote from mahmoud darwish, an arabic poet, on my arm. he immediately said no again and when i mentioned that at the end of the day it’s my body and choice he lost it. he called me selfish and an idiot because i wanted to do something he disagreed with. i said that i’m gonna be 18 soon and he won’t be able to dictate my life and that was when he truly blew up and turned into something that wasn’t my dad. he said he’d rather me leave his house and never come back then act like this - which infuriates me because i truly have no authority over my own body as long as he is around. but what he said next was what destroyed me. i’m an overweight girl and i know it. in the years i got depressed i put on so much weight which has been super hard to lose. i despise myself and my body but to hear my dad say “you don’t even take care of your body in the first place, you’re fat and too lazy to even go to the gym.” when i said that i just want to feel confident in my own skin. whenever i argue with my dad, he always brings up things we’ve disagreed about to use against me. my best friend is gay, and my parents know unfortunately. they said he’s influenced me, causing me to dress the way i do and want tattoos and piercings. in his opinion, if i ever hang out with gay people when im older, they’ll turn me gay (jokes on u lol), and if that ever happens then i’d never be welcome home again. this fucking tore me apart because it reminded me i’ll never have hope of them being accepting of me coming out, so it’s out of the question. 

sorry if this is too much of a sob story lol i’m currently struggling to keep myself composed and there’s far more to talk about but i just needed to say everything. these past few years, i’ve wasted my teenage years, the supposedly happiest years of my life, weighing out the pros and cons of cutting off my family. i have no fucking choice and i’m so lost and scared deciding my life right now. my family only love me when i’m the daughter they want me to be, that fits their expectations and standards. i can either spend my life living a lie, living and someone else in order to stay with my family or i can abandon them and leave everything behind just to live a life in which i’m free and i’m living as my true self.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I carry the painful awareness of my toxic tendencies. It is an understanding that has led me to seek professional help, driven by the desire to change and grow. I must admit that controlling my temper has proven to be a constant struggle, often leading to unnecessary conflicts and explosive outbursts. In moments of weakness, I have resorted to manipulating others, crossing their boundaries and causing harm. Unless I actively seek help, these destructive patterns only seem to intensify.As I stand on the brink of marriage, I reflect upon the remarkable journey I have shared with my partner over the past ten years. Unlike the partners I had in the past, who were unable to withstand the impact of my unmedicated state, this person has chosen to remain steadfast by my side. Their unwavering support and love have been a beacon of hope in my life.However, fate has once again placed me in a vulnerable position, without the aid of medication that has previously helped me maintain stability. It is during these times that I am reminded of the challenges faced by someone striving to be &quot;good-hearted&quot; while grappling with the absence of proper treatment.To fully grasp the complexities of my situation, it is crucial to delve into the painful chapters of my past. I have endured the unimaginable, subjected to multiple instances of rape that left me scarred both physically and emotionally. I have faced the terrifying specter of death, narrowly escaping as hands tightened around my throat. The very people who should have protected me, such as my own father, have caused unspeakable harm, leaving permanent wounds on my body and spirit. My mother, too, has suffered greatly, falling into a coma due to extreme sexual abuse and suicide attempts. These traumas have etched themselves into the fabric of my existence, shaping the person I am today.Alongside these personal struggles, I have faced periods of profound hardship. Homelessness has <mark>forced</mark> me to live out of my car, enduring unimaginable challenges and deprivation. There were times when hunger gnawed at me until I was nothing more than skin and bones, teetering on the edge of survival. Against all odds, I managed to rebuild my life, finding stability in a successful career where I earned a commendable income.Yet, even in the face of apparent triumph, life delivered another crushing <mark>blow</mark>. In an act of violation and disrespect, a manager crossed boundaries by grabbing me under my skirt in an elevator. Consumed by outrage, I voiced my dissent, ensuring there were witnesses who could attest to the truth. However, the very system designed to protect employees failed me when HR dismissed the incident, subjecting me to a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). This unjust treatment occurred despite my outstanding performance review, recent raise, and promising prospects for advancement within the company. Given the circumstances, I found myself presented with a difficult decision: accept the PIP or choose severance. Although some may question my decision, I opted for the latter, perhaps influenced by my overwhelming circumstances.Now, without the financial means to afford necessary medication, I find myself without that crucial support system. In sharing this story, please understand that it is not an appeal for sympathy, but rather an opportunity to shed light on the reasons behind my current unmedicated state. I am motivated by a deep sense of responsibility to explain why my treatment has been interrupted since my severance ran out.It is with a heavy heart that I contemplate the impact of my trauma on the person I hold dear—the purest and most beautiful soul I have ever met: my partner. They become an unwitting victim of my struggles, bearing the weight of my imperfections. Their needs are simple, reasonable, and yet I find myself unintentionally making them feel inadequate and flawed. The contrast between their inherent goodness and my own self-doubt becomes painfully apparent.Recognizing the pain I cause my partner weighs heavily on my conscience. I cannot ignore the stark disparity between their admirable qualities and my own flaws. In this vulnerable state, I am left grappling with a fundamental question: how can I transform myself to cease inflicting feelings of inadequacy upon them? It is a deeply personal and intricate journey, one that demands profound introspection, a commitment to growth, and the tireless pursuit of healing from the wounds of my past.

These are the thoughts of a toxic person who has the vocabulary to express their thoughts constructively.  I am working on it, and I want to love my perfect person.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">ever since we were kids, my brother (17m) has been spoiled rotten by my mom. whatever he wanted, he pretty much got. it doesn’t help that he’s the youngest and the only boy, he is 100% my moms golden child to this day. 

this past sunday (mother’s day) we had plans to go to the beach. but the weather wasn’t great so we decided to do a sip and paint as a plan b. he didn’t help pay for any of the stuff (food or materials), he didn’t contribute to gift planning or cards, and he didn’t help us set up. also had an attitude the whole time and mom just babied him about it. 

my birthday was a few weeks ago and he didn’t get a gift until the day of. which would be fine (not a huge birthday person, def don’t need gifts) if it weren’t for the fact that my mom was running around trying to find something. 

there’s so much more that i could go on and on about. he doesn’t help out around the house unless “he made the mess”, he’s rude and condescending, and he can’t drive so we are constantly <mark>forced</mark> to take him where he needs to go. it’s exhausting. im not a parent and this isn’t my child, but if i say this to my mom we’re “being mean” to him and she goes off about how we’d want someone to do the same for us. my dad is pretty hands off about it bc anything he says about it is challenged by my mom, so he thinks it’s a waste of time. 

he doesn’t date (as far as i know) but if he ever gets a partner, i seriously hope he shapes up. i pray anyone, but especially any girl, doesn’t put up with his shit and shows him he’s an adult, not a baby. i read and hear so many stories of women being parents, caregivers, teachers, sexual beings, and so much more to men who are essentially useless children, and every time i think of my brother, which is just so sad to me. 

it’s just a shitty situation. experiencing this since i can remember has genuinely influenced how i view siblings and parents, and has made me question if i even want kids. i never want to have one of my kids feeling like i do, and i constantly fear that somehow i’ll end up favoring one and not realize. to any parents, pls make sure you’re raising children who are decent. don’t force your daughters to be a second/third parent and just let your son fuck around. don’t let one kid get away with everything and hold your other ones to impossible standards. we as children notice it. and it’s not a nice feeling. 

(i doubt this will <mark>blow</mark> up, but i don’t give permission for my story to be shared. don’t want anyone seeing this and it gets linked to me somehow. thanks :))</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I’m 17 and graduating this year as a junior. I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life but my composition teacher made us do a 5 year plan and she said to be specific with it, we had to plan out each year. It was the same day the marine recruiter came to the lunchroom. I did more pull ups than anyone there (22) and I’m kind of a self confident person but I beat myself up when I do something wrong. My older brother wanted to go to the marines but he is kind of screwing up his future right now <mark>blow</mark>ing $600 a week on weed with no car insurance, so I didn’t tell my mom about the marines because I was kind of doing the same thing. Until I recently got in trouble at school for just being under the influence, a 5 day suspension and expulsion hearing but I’m back in school because a few of my teachers wrote good letters about how I’m a respectful student, and my grades last quarter were pretty fire. Anyways, I finally told my mom about the marines and she thought I was bullshitting because I hadn’t said anything about it previously. So it took a little convincing and now that she believes me and we talked to the recruiter and stuff (I was 16 when he came to my school and I did the pull-ups so I wasn’t allowed to technically sign any papers yet so he wanted nothing to do with me until I turned 17) I took a practice ASVAB today and scored a 61. My mom says she supports it but she keeps trying to tell me I have so much more potential than joining the marines, she thinks I should join the Air Force. My step dad who’s a police officer tells me I’m a businessman, a CEO. He says the marines are grunts and that they are basically a bunch of strong idiots, first ones to show up and the last to leave, he says it’s noble but it’s not smart, he said the same about being a police officer. It’s dumb to throw yourself in the front lines and sleep in barracks with 50 other dudes when you could join the Air Force and sleep in your own apartment with an office job or be an aviation pilot making 400-500k a year. I just feel like I was set on the marines for the self discipline and pride of being a marine aspect, the physical requirements alone are what I saw as a challenge, I feel like to push yourself to that point takes a lot mentally, break you down to build you up, and I wasn’t looking to do a full 20 years just one term, max that TSP out and take advantage of the VA loan to be an entrepreneur of some sort when I get out. If you read this all the way through I really appreciate it, please help me out here.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed"> I lost my dad this year. To covid. 

I don&#x27;t remember a lot of it. I don&#x27;t want to remember the rest of it. But while tossing on my bed through one of the sleepless nights, I&#x27;m usually hit with flashes of memories, and viewing them through the adult lenses I have is particularly difficult. Nothing really prepares you for death. There are things I wish I had done and words I wish I had said, but here I am- sitting at my desk thinking of everything I wish I would have conveyed to him before he left. 

He really was my biggest influence. You know how usually after someone passes on, they say &#x27;I wish I can be even a fraction of the person you were&#x27;. I always thought that was cliched. &#x27;A little too much&#x27;, I used to think. The more I live in the post papa world, the more I realize how much it is true for me. 

...

One of my earliest memories is going to an ice cream stand with him. I had been crying incessantly because I didn&#x27;t get full marks in some random exam, and he wanted to have a &#x27;talk&#x27; with me. Munching on the ice cream, still sobbing, we started talking. He prodded me to talk about my feelings, and I said something along the lines of &#x27;I wish I was Payal. Full marks aa jate fir mere (I would&#x27;ve received full marks then)&#x27;. Payal, of course, being the topper of our school. He then, in his characteristic papa voice, went, &#x27;Par padhai to aap utni hi karte. Fir Payal dukhi hoti ki uske marks kam hai.(You would have studied the same though. Then Payal would have been sad because she scored less)&#x27; I was in KG then, I remember. The concept of interchanging brains and lives suddenly became too complicated for me. &#x27;I&#x27;d just be a sad Payal then&#x27;, I remember thinking. We sat in silence on the scooter for a long time, just mulling over the idea. The memory still grounds me, at 27. It was the first time in my life I realized I was the captain of my life. 

He always had unconventional dreams. His life goal was to have one of those big buses with rooms. And travel around the world for a living. As a kid, I never understood it. The idea of roaming around in a bus did not fit the conventional lifestyle I am intrinsically partial to. He asked me to make a list, of 100 things I want to have. Dream diary, he used to call it. I could only do 30. Have a big house, with a swimming pool and library and garden. &#x27;Think more&#x27;, he prodded. &#x27;It can be anything at all.&#x27; I was still hesitating. &quot;It&#x27;s for your eyes only. Nobody would know&quot;.  That made things interesting. &#x27;I... I want to meet a fairy&#x27;, I said in a small voice. &#x27;But I am not a 100% sure they exist&#x27;. &#x27;That&#x27;s okay&#x27;, he said. You can still dream, beta. Put it out, for the universe to respond. And I did. Growing up, I kept adding to that list. The dreams started becoming more and more &#x27;realistic&#x27;, more grown up, more worldly. But I dreamt. He taught me to. 

What I&#x27;ll miss the most is the magic he bought into my life. I was in 1st grade when I &#x27;discovered&#x27; that there was no Santa Claus. The writing on my gifts was suspiciously always very similar to his , so my belief in an actual Santa Claus had been waning for months. But one fine Christmas morning I got a sketch pen set and my sister got a sweater. As I was loitering about with sketch pens in hand- I heard mom tell dad &#x27;Sweater acha lag raha hai. Apne liye bhi le lena aisa hi(Sweater looks nice. Let a similar one for yourself)&#x27;. A huge <mark>blow</mark>, tbh. As I stood in the hallway, accusing him of lying to us every year, he said- &#x27;Par Santa Claus to hota hai. He&#x27;s an idea. Wo koi insaan nahi hai. (But Santa does exist, He&#x27;s not a person, he&#x27;s an idea) He&#x27;s the force that tells me to buy you guys gift every year.  &#x27;. Of course, it was too deep for a 6 year old, but that&#x27;s who he was. Philosophical and deep, and completely unpredictable. Honestly, I never did find out if he was trolling, I should&#x27;ve asked. But he did renew my faltering faith in the entity for another two years. He&#x27;s gone, and so has the magic. The world now feels normal, with no one telling me to believe in a power in the wave of overwhelming negativity.   
...  


I always thought that there was a way things are supposed to go. As a kid, your father is your world. Mine was. You&#x27;re supposed to grow up and move out, and take a few years to figure yourself out. Everything home is then a &#x27;little too traditional&#x27; for you. You meet people, you interact with the world. You realize your parents are also humans trying their best. They&#x27;re not the superheroes you thought they were. And then you go back, with a renewed understanding. Your relationship with them changes, there is more empathy. There&#x27;s redefining the boundaries. Papa left too early. 

I hope he knows how much he meant to me. How much he still means to me. I am me, this complex weird human with empathy and love and strong beliefs because he was a father who raised me the way he did. The father who quietly told me he knew I cheated when I tried to pull one over during a parlour game we were playing. (&#x27;We don&#x27;t do that in this family&#x27;). Who inculcated a reading habit in me, not by telling me to read but by surrounding me with books. Who was open, honest, and always there. 

I was 15, when I had my first panic attack. I couldn&#x27;t get a print out of some project I had been working on for weeks, and I was a mess. Dad happened to be home that day. He calmed me down, talked to me, and then hugged me. He was the first person who ever could get through me during one of my episodes, and I find solace in that hug till date.

I wish I could hug him one last time. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This is difficult for me to explain calmly with all my raging emotions... but I am going to try...
For the past-almost 20 years, I’ve been the dutiful, obedient, and most of all- silent daughter. Tonight I unintentionally unleashed all my frustrations to my Russian parents. I spoke what was on my mind for once. 

I want to give as much clear context, and unbiased information as I can possibly muster in these moments after having a shouting argument with the both of them for the past 45 minutes. My throat hurts, I’ve cried too much than I wanted to in front of them.

Let me begin explaining some background information. So you can understand fully and hopefully lend me some advice and support on this matter.

I have moved 10 times since I was age 6. I’ve had an unstable education because of it. I have a big family. 
5 elder brothers
1 older sister
me 
and then my younger brother

5 of my elder brothers have married and are no longer a part of our lives because we have moved away from them. We have just recently moved into a home we can finally call our own. 

For the first time in my life...at 19 years of age I have my own room! Before that- I was <mark>sleeping</mark> in a crowded mattress with my other siblings, or living room couches, or the floor. I never had my own space, they never thought that was necessary. 
I had to beg them to get a house with an extra room. So I can have my privacy. They kept complaining about the extra cost. But I had about done with the “we have no money” I hear. every. single. day. (at least) Somehow I was able to persuade them. I have my own room now. 

In their eyes that’s another reason for me to “be grateful.” and “thank God” 
but I see it as a necessity I had been waiting for all my life. I have been isolated my whole life. 
It was hard for me to keep friends... because my mom would chase them all away. I had ones I loved dearly in middle school... my mom <mark>forced</mark> me to break the friendship or she would withdraw me from school. 

So I ended it- and I was completely alone- still am, 6 years later.
The reason she used: “they are bad influence, and will affect you to do bad things”
My friend was the most sweetest girl- she didn’t deserve me up-and-leaving without a goodbye- I will forever regret it—

no matter how good of a girl I was I could never gain my parent’s trust to keep my friends. I had to give them all up. 

So I was/ am isolated. Any friend I try to make goes through their strict screening/ extremely judgemental strainer, so to speak.

I have been stripped from
any support that I could possibly reach out for- so in a pathetic attempt I am turning to the internet- as unwise as that may be- I need support, validation, whatever... I have no idea if this is normal or not. 

and If I actually am just an “ungrateful” “devilish girl”  like they say I am. I really need your help!!! 

My dad’s relationship with me- obsolete. 
Believe me I’ve tried salvaging it. He wants nothing to do with communicating with me. 

There are two blocks: Language, and his personality. Like I said before, my parent’s first language is Russian. I was raised in America. They didn’t bother to learn the English language and neither did they bother with teaching me the Russian language. (But they taught all my older brothers) It doesnt make sense- maybe it’s just me they hate? 

and so here I am- not able to communicate with them properly even if I wanted to??  I think they gave up “trying” when it came to me and my younger brother... 
Even so I don’t say anything, I try to be grateful, for 3 meals a day and ask for nothing else. God forbid I ask for 20 dollars once every 3 months.. and just want some freaking dark chocolate because I am on my period!,$,!,$I I’m told “I don’t have money” every single day even if there is something essential I  need. ( Like pads ) I’m sorry I couldn’t control my blood flow— sorry to be a burden—

So I got a job. After begging them to let me. My dad allowed use of the car just for that- and then... he asked me for my money. 

The only correspondence I have with my dad goes like this. 

Daily my dad says this as if it was his favorite routine ( in Russian ) 

“Did you work today? No? Well I made ___ amount of money. I have to pay the bills, the money for food, gas. I am so tired.” *he dramatically sighs 
and then proceeds to ask me for any money I have. 

All my life I’ve been told only two things by both of my parents- no. make that three. 

1. “We don’t have any money. Don’t ask me for money. Even if we don’t have food in the fridge, and you need to go for a grocery run. “

(No, not true. What I realized after observing them for years is their horrible budgeting skills, illogical spending habits.) 

 2. “Wait. Be patient. Be quiet. This will pass. Fruit of the spirit is love, and patience,and endurance.” 

Example: I had been asking for piano lessons since I was 7 because I loved and still love the piano.   I was told “ wait, and be quiet.” I trusted them, and thought they knew what was best... the topic of piano lessons never came up ever again. 

3. Go to church. Every sunday. 

Now this one is a topic in itself. I had only learned what the world misogyny meant yesterday- that- is my dad. 

He believes all I am good for is to be married off to a suitable Russian, bible reading man that attends church every sunday, then to have 10 kids of my own and raise them up as good christians.

I don’t want to be married off! I’m not some burden!! I quit going to church altogether after my eyes started to open up to the reality of my parents- ( 1 year ago) and since then there has not been a day that has gone by where they have not preached to me, told me I was sinning by not going to church, and told me I needed to repent. 
It’s driving me insane and I can no longer be the quiet, enduring, patient girl- in other words they just want me to be COMPLACENT and SHUT UP! 

Now that I’ve explained the intense background overview
fast forward to now, the present day- 
I blew up. For the first time. Okay, look. I was not planning to <mark>blow</mark> up. 
I wanted to talk calmly, have a deep conversation for the first time with them... I’m not sure what I was expecting... I thought they would have some understanding...

I started shouting uncontrollably and crying simultaneously when they just wouldn’t stop talking over me. I couldn’t even get out 5 of my rehearsed words out before getting talked over. I am extremely soft spoken, and need to have them listen, naturally, I cant raise my voice but for the first time in my life I raised my voice, the loudest I could. They wouldn’t listen- no matter what tone I used. 
I figured I would drown out their gospel preaching, and yells to repent. My mother said “Only the devil uses that tone!” and closed her ears to anything else I said.... so with the loudest voice I could I spilled all my feelings I had bottled up for the past 20 years. 

All along my older sister recorded my heated argument with my parents- I would share it here if I could- but I’m not sure if I can, and how I would translate the Russian language they speak back to me in the argument? Anyways

What I said was so simple, but they couldn’t understand. 

What I shouted was. 
“I don’t care about the money, I could care less if we are poor, I don’t want to hear it anymore! Day after day you talk to me about the lack of money and how much of a burden I am to you! 
You never bothered learning english so I am speaking to deaf ears with some hope that you will understand me! The only thing I ever wanted from you was a relationship, I wanted to know you! And I wanted for you to listen to me in return for me listening to you! You never gave me a chance to talk! ever! Every time I try to talk, you will tell me “trust in God, go to church, read the bible.” But you wouldn’t even sit down and have a conversation with me in the practical sense.” 

I know I shouted all of this in vain, because they did not understand a word of it. My mom understood only bits and pieces and decided to turn my words around, (what little she could understand) I can imagine that all my dad could see was my body language, and loud tone of voice as I shouted and wailed helplessly hoping that they would miraculously be able to transcend language barriers. So he started to lecture me in that Russian language that I can understand- but can not speak- and so I am robbed of my voice when it comes to communicating with him!!! 

I just shouted even more. Speaking everything directly to their faces..
And they understood not a word of it.

I never did this before so I had no idea how to contain my anger, the more they spoke on about biblical nonsense the more it enraged me that they couldn’t see that their daughter had just come to them pleading for them to just try having a relationship with her.

My dad doesn’t want me- is all I can think. 
He smiled at my rage and tears even to the point of chuckling. 
and it was at that moment that I felt incredibly repulsed by my dad. Does he even care? I’m trying to understand for god’s sake??!! What the hell is going on in their minds.

And my mom? Does she have ears? Can’t she just listen for a second ??! 
I have to shout godammit to get my quiet voice to reach their ears and now it is ripped raw- with absolutely no gain- this has made everything worse. My mother “fake” cries in the her room, guilt tripping me, using the same old excuse that her “heart hurts”-
well mine does too!!! They’ve tried to persuade me to go to church this weekend, they are currently knocking on the my locked bedroom door. 


It’s my birthday in 3 days, I’ve never celebrated it before.. my parents never cared about my birthday well because mother’s day would always steal away all their attention. 
But since it’s my 20th birthday I thought to do something special by myself, go to the zoo or something- but that might be too much to ask for afterall. 

I’ve talked to people online once before, but barely scratching the surface they asked me why I don’t move out.  You don’t understand, I have been stripped from all support, the only people I’ve been programmed to trust are my parents- that has only just now been broken. I am on my own. 
I don’t even know how to do things an adult knows how to do. I’ve been extremely sheltered. I have no social skills. No real life skills. I’m scared to death of people, because my mom says that men will try to rape me and women will stab my back because they are jealous of me. 

I can’t trust this world. I can’t trust anyone. 
I can only be alone. Ever since birth I have been only a burden.

Please help, I need support. I am incredibly alone for the past 20 years. I need someone to relate to. I just need anyone to reply,,, anything!! Just make me feel alive, and human. Let me know you are human and that there is still some people who can be trusted in this world. Any who is doesn’t mean any harm to other?? is there anyone like that??  

I just want to be gone from here. It’s too much pain. 
I can’t write anymore from the tears on my phone. 

if you read thsis far ,,,, I’m sorry I think I just threw one of those- what do you call them- “pity party?” ah yes I am drowning in my self hate, and sorrow, I am truly a burden. 

I don’t know if I should be grateful for what I have, or if I should stand up for what I been lacking my whole life.

Please help me
How can I cope living with them? 
How can I make things better? 

How can I manage my pent up emotions? 
I am at a complete loss of what to do...
I feel like my life is already over. I should just end it all.. but I am hoping, there is still some hope.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">TLDR; decades of feeling &#x27;people are inherently good&#x27; systematically reduced to &#x27;people are garbage&#x27; over the past months.  ?Forever? changing my view of people, society, religion and politics.  Godspeed to patient readers.

As I sit down to write *this* I struggle with what *this* actually is beforehand.  Isn’t that what you’re suppose to do, first task of doing *something* is being able to describe what *something* is? Yet here I am, a beehive of thoughts swarming in my head for just shy of a year now and frustrated because I can’t even put a word to what I’m trying to do here.

I find it far easier to call upfront what it isn’t, or isn’t intended to be.  This isn’t an opinion piece intended to change anyones mind.  I’ve come to a hard-earned opinion that people don’t tend to change their minds, nor do I feel the right or obligation to do so even if I could.  It isn’t a call for attention, I won’t be sharing this with anyone I am close to and I’m not convinced I’ll share publicly, but if I do it’ll definitely be anonymous.   It isn’t a topic on politics, but politics plays a supporting role.  It isn’t a topic on Covid 19, but again a strong supporting role.  Faith, values, self-inspection,….a mirage of players have <mark>forced</mark> their way to the front of the stage demanding attention on a weary mind.  I want, perhaps need, to come to terms with things I once *knew* for 50+ years that have unraveled in the past 12 months.  I’m forever a changed man in one revolution of the sun, not for the better, perhaps not for the worse.  My view of the world no longer the same, and certainly not for the better.  This, will be an attempt to describe the journey I’ve taken over the past years, challenging my once steadfast beliefs and temporarily (or permanently) changed them.  There will be no advice, no moral to the story, certainly no answers to extremely complex issues.  

In the ‘information age’, how do you tell a story with sufficient details and still retain some level of anonymity?  How do you share enough about yourself, who you are, how you were, your story, your relationships and background with enough detail to those that don’t know you yet preserve anonymity to prevent what you say to hurt you and those you speak of?  A great deal of my struggles deal with those I did, perhaps still do, consider my closest of friends and family.  What I share can bring consequences to them, how others may choose to see them and me for the rest of our existence.  So, I’ll do my level best to share enough, so you can understand who I was, who I think I am today, as I prepare for who I will be in the future.  Enough info to understand me sufficiently, hopefully not enough to identify me and anyone I speak about.

I grew up in the midwest, one of many children to a working class family.  Some would say poor, others may classify as lower middle class.  I’d simply call us ‘trailer park folks’, as that’s where we lived for a good chunk of my childhood, later graduating to a middle-class house.  My parents worked hard to accomplish such a feat and that’s likely a strong reason I believe in the achievement of the American dream, something I continue to believe in, my faith a bit weaker in it today.  Our rural town had a population in the hundreds, churches outnumbering the bars 3-to-1 and we were a ‘church going’ people.  My entire childhood I was surrounded by good, honest, religious people.  I was brought up to extend a hand to those that needed it, chip into the collection plate as a tribute and means to spread good into the world.  Our 80+ year old neighbor and adjacent church never had to shovel their driveway or sidewalk because we were brought up to respect our elders and generally be ‘good’ to others.  We had strong youthful backs, to see our elders struggling to shovel snow just wasn’t a thing you would do.  Those characteristics ingrained deeply into my beliefs and actions.  I never drove by a car in distress, exchanged a cheery greeting to those I met on the street, always opened the door for ladies.  I recognized there were ‘bad’ people in the world, not naive in my thinking, but I truly, deeply believed that people are inherently ‘good’ in general with ‘bad seeds’ to a lesser degree.  I had to believe that, my actions required it;  stopping in the middle of the night for a car in distress demanded that I believe the person in wait needed help rather than meaning me harm.   

Quick side-bar; in this day and age you are judged not only in what you say, but also in what you don’t say.  That said, I don’t want to portrait that I was, or am, a faultless man or make claims that I was/am a good person.  I feel I tried to be a good man 98% of the time, doing what I thought was appropriate, and I feel I’d be viewed as a good person by those who met me: friends, family and strangers alike.  Unfortunately, we are all a work-in-progress and things that were acceptable in one era change in time.  I certainly took part in things that were and are ‘bad’ as well as things that were considered ‘good’ in times past.  I stole, drank, swore, teased my classmates, was quick to anger, and tried to ‘be a man’ in the manner of the era which by todays standards could be viewed as masculine toxicity.   Point is, I’m not trying to depict that I was even remotely perfect, even good.  I did however, think of myself as a good man living in a world of good people and that believe was my companion into later life.  Our lives are like a book and I am bringing you in somewhere in the middle, you get only a partial view of my world and I’m trying to provide an accurate portrayal.

I believed people were inherently good and in that belief the majority of the world would behave accordingly.  We need not be <mark>forced</mark>, like school children, to behave or be civil.  As adults, good people would make good decisions with good information.  I would defend this ideal with vigor having seen it everyday and taking part in it.  People would occasionally be in need, others would respond.  An unresponsive car on the side of the road, people would stop.  A heavy snowfall, people would help each other out.  The community park is a mess, a platoon of volunteers would respond.  This family was struggling due to a loss of job, the church would respond in masses.  Volunteer fire departments, neighbors helping neighbors…. This is how the world worked, communities take care of each other.  It was self-governing, self-correcting and self-balancing.  If the ‘people in need’ needed an occasional hand the community would be ready to assist,  if the community felt taken advantage of by the same people the assistance would disappear leaving them to become self-reliant or make better decisions.  People are in general good, *some* people are lazy/selfish and they need to become self-independent like the rest of us.  That was my belief, guiding principles and aligned with my political party (as I believed at that time).  To my recollection, I’ve voted straight-line Republican from the time I was 18 to 2016 with the very few exceptions.  This admittance of political party will undoubtedly strike anger and judgment in many readers heart-of-hearts and likely be the last sentence read.  I ask that you postpone judgment for just a bit if you are even remotely curious why someone may align with that party.   Everyone has their reasons, often boiled down to a couple key ones.  Many folks are single-issue voters, for example how they feel about abortion regulation.  For me, decentralized government and gun rights were my primary hitters.  ‘People are good’, enabling them to make the best decisions is the best path.  Government should be decentralized allowing your state/county/city to make decisions that are best for your communities and enable choice.  Like the free market, it offered individuals choice.  If you valued lower taxes over well-funded education, move there.  If you prioritized high quality health services over low taxes, move there.  Similarly, my views with guns, people are good, bad people exist but it’s impossible to stop them from getting guns.  Good gun owner protect against bad guys…..the world is a dangerous place and disarming the good guys leaves us vulnerable to the bad guys.  You hear a window break in the middle of the night and you have a choice between a phone or gun…..one or the other, which do you choose?  Living in rural America, you need to be prepared to fend for your own, police response times aren’t measured in minutes.  Either of these topics are wrought with complexity, my views on them are equally complex and challenged daily and any principle has a tendency of falling apart when it’s met with extremes.   I bring them up only because they are/were both founded in a guiding principle that ‘people are generally good’, not all conservative are ‘monsters’ and rational people recognize such principles are complex and wrought with areas of gray.

I leave my childhood community for university focused on a degree in science/engineering.  My values and opinions along for the and continue to be rein<mark>forced</mark> as my world opens up.  Six+ years of being introduced to a level of diversity I had never experienced before, international students, alternative sexuality and diverse opinions discussed in detail in classroom settings.  As the world opens up, my values were challenged, resulting in them becoming rein<mark>forced</mark> or weakened.  The world, now bigger and more complex, but my values still held mostly true to me.  My connection to religion lessened, not a significant point but worth noting and my relationships with people of diverse background allowed for changing some views along the way.  For instance, as a white heterosexual man who didn’t really know any homosexuals it was easy to use slurs on my fellow classmates and hate (or at least not care about) the homosexual community.  Sadly, it’s easy to hate people you don’t know, university introduced me to kind, intelligent, interesting people who happen to be gay.  Later, I found that my childhood classmates well-hid their sexuality for years and I felt a feeling of shame to be responsible for being part of such a culture.   

I left university with a newfound appreciation for logic, information, and prided myself with not being heavily influenced by emotion.  Many may feel this is a particular level of arrogance, and justly perhaps it is, but I’m giving you a view of who I am warts and all.  My decisions are guided by head over heart, I buy things I needed and give value rather than just wanted, I save money for future needs rather than immediate desires, I gave to charities that I felt made a difference over those that targeted tugging your heart strings.  Statistics and numbers demanded my attention over one-off stories.  “Nearly 1/5 women in the US have been raped” demands my attention over even the most compelling disturbing emotional story about someone who is subjected to it.  Both would fill me with sadness, anger and disappointment in the world, but one depicted the urgency of the problem to be solved and wiped away the illusion that its an uncommon occurrence and a desperate call to action.   My point is, I value data and science over lack thereof.  That was/is the way to my attention, a problem exists show me how bad it is and how I can help.  The takeaway, I’m an engineer and scientist, aligning better with principles/projects/parties that are founded in logic and reason.  This rein<mark>forced</mark> my alignment with the Republican party, businesses are data-driven making logical decisions, distributed governments with smaller budgets need to prioritize and make better decisions out of necessity.  The Democratic party just never seemed to align with my values, they seemed to bolster support by emotions, they enabled lazy folks to be dependent on others, they seemed to push for big government with larger budgets which surely would incur waste.  Surely, Democratic voters must simply be uneducated, victims of emotional persuasion, or socialist lazy parasites…..right?

These were my opinions, adapted for brevity, so they sound harder than they were.  I consider myself a reasonable man, a more accurate depiction of how I viewed political parties would be lengthy so I’m trying to stay on point rather than go into more detail on what drives my past/present political views.

Years after college, I met and married the love of my life.  Two things worth knowing about her; 1) she is significantly smarter and more educated than I, like by a lot, and 2) her political views are 180-degrees from mine.  She grew up in a blue state, I a red state;  I vote red, she votes blue each canceling each other out.  It’s been like that for decades.  We’ve had detailed discussions on a variety of topics, hardly ever changing either of our minds and that’s how it is and will be for eternity….right?

Then, 2020;

I’m going to place a ton of issues on 2020, many of which were in motion in the proceeding years, but 2020 really was the catalyst for attention.  Just like the Challenger explosion, years of things led up to that moment, we will likely remember 2020 in the same manner as we remember the 1986 the catastrophic event resulting from an accumulation of events leading up to it.

This rambling isn’t about politics, Trump, racism or Covid….it’s about all of it but not specifically any one of them.  It’s above all about people and how I view them, past and present.  I tend to get offtrack if I don’t remind myself of this.

January 2020, we were becoming aware of something most of us have never lived through or likely even given fleeting thought about.  Zombies and outbreaks may be our guilty pleasure for entertainment, but surely no one would behave that way.  As the severity mounts, we hear in passing references to 1918 flu epidemic, curious you begin to read about historical accounts of how society behaves.  Three typical behaviors tend to emerge: 1) those that flee, 2) those that hunker down, 3) those that ignore.  Experts know this, they spend their careers studying it and it’s their life-long purpose to understand pandemics and provide guidance to guide us through it.  Then, the day arrives and the most unthinkable happens, a majority of folks simply ignore it. Huh?  We’re smarter than that, right?  As school children, the fire department comes in to talk about fire safety and we learn what to do.  Smoke filled room, what do you do?  Your clothes catch fire, what do you do?  Exiting a room, why do you feel the doorknob?  As a child who’s never experienced a fire, an expert who has been trained and absolutely experienced them specifically offers you guidance/education, we’re not dumb enough to completely disregard them….are we?  A resounding ‘YEP’ is heard across the nation.

For most of 2020, I could still balance my beliefs and these anti-everything people.  I’d simply put them in a bucket labeled ‘idiots’.  Cheeto….goes in the bucket, a host of uneducated people….goes in the bucket, Qanon believers…..goes in the bucket, flat-earthers….antivaxers….folks that buy the ‘National Enquirer’ to read the ***facts*** about the latest celebrity alien baby…..go in the bucket.  It’s pretty easy to throw people you don’t know into such a bucket.  They’re dumb, I don’t know them, they don’t affect me…  I’d gladly offer my opinion and ‘educate’ them if they wished, but it’s not my place.  People do stupid things; buy shit they can’t afford, choose not to save for the future,...still inherently good, make bad choices, but it doesn’t affect me.  Live a life of excess and obesity, spend your later years a type-2 diabetic.  Neglect your teeth, dentures are in your near future.  Smoke and drink like the day may be your last, and one day you’ll be right.  Spend every dime you get on the latest cars, pickups and recreational vehicles and prepare to eat government cheese in your later years.  I’ll live my life my way, you live it your way, as long as we both take responsibility for the end results we are in agreement.  Still, people are good, right?  They may make bad choices that will affect them and their immediate family, but they’re still good people, right?

Enter anti-maskers, the beginning of erosion of my faith in society.  It starts with the flat-earth equivalent folks who proclaim it to be an indoctrination of repression, Klandma-style sillyness; it begins as entertainment, surely no one is really dumb enough to think that, right?  I have a brother-in-law that believes in bigfoot, ghosts and goblins….he and only he believes in such fairy tales; harmless and entertaining, you pat him on the head and go on with your day.  While it’s disturbing to know that his vote counts just as much as yours, you find some solace in that there are only a small fraction of such believers.  Values still preserved, there are still ‘bad’ people but ‘good’ people hold the majority.  The good, educated, caring folks outnumber the idiots.  And for me, I maintained that believe for the first couple months of self-quarantining.

Let me share with you my experience with masks, I trust others have the similar experiences.  My wife and I began self-quarantined in March with the luxury of working from home 100% of the time.  Throughout that time we would do monthly grocery shopping, our only significant exposure to people.  As teenagers we were self-conscious and heavily prone to peer pressure.  We downplay such things to our kids like in such a manner as to kid ourselves that we evolved beyond that.  A zit on your nose as a teenager is catastrophic, to a lesser degree as an adult.  March/April I wore a fabricated mask as the experts recommended.  I’d wager 70% of the people I encountered were mask-free.  Businesses didn’t require them, of their customers nor employees.  May-Aug you started seeing them gain popularity, I’d wager 40% mask-free folks in my local grocery stores.  The non-maskers always had the ‘Mean Girl’ vibe, giving you the side-eye like you just showed up to school in last years fashion.  Big orange home improvement stores routinely had non-maskers working the checkout lines because it infringed on the employees health care rights to require otherwise...blah, blah, blah.  Adults regressed into children in a matter of months touting personal liberties, religious exceptions, fake healthcare exception cards, armed with phone in hand daring businesses to deny their entry…...complete bullshit.  “I don’t want to and you can’t make me”; behaving like little children, nothing more.  It’s all been said before, it’s just sad the example it sets.  We think of the young as being immature, but what I witnessed was a transformation of behavior where the young were adopting masks earlier than the adults.  That gives me more faith in the next generations than that of ours, likely similar to feelings on climate change and other complexities we ‘adults’ tend to ostrich on.  I also observed a dramatic difference between mask/non-mask behaviors in rural communities (who tended to  ignore the pandemic) and larger populated cities.  In my experience, rural communities tend to behave similar to high school, cliches that continue beyond school and a ‘what would others think’ goose-stepping with the current crowd.  Eventually, the anti-maskers became the minority but, after almost a year, you’ll always find one jackass in a store.

My choice to wear a mask was primarily to avoid contributing to the spread, especially to someone I love with possibly fatal consequences.  I have two elderly parents and I couldn’t live with myself if I was the cause of their death.  I have a loving wife that I don’t want to infect and just generally I’d rather not be the cause of  pain/suffering/death of ‘good people’.  I couldn’t imagine people feeling differently.  It’s not like I was somehow immune to the discomfort and inconvenience of wearing one.  But, here I was, witnessing a great deal of folks who were doing everything in their power to spread a completely avoidable pandemic.  It was, and is, mind-boggling.  My ‘idiot’ bucket continued to fill with ‘uncaring’ psychopathic strangers.  My ‘people are good’ yarn of belief unraveling at an alarming rate.

Still, it’s easy to disconnect from folks you don’t know and their ridiculous beliefs/ignorance/arrogance.  It becomes harder, or impossible, when the call comes from within the house.  A big mistake I made early in 2020 is to assume the world would see reality as I saw it, that fell apart quickly.  My second mistake in later 2020 was to believe that people I knew, loved, and respected would see reality as I did, strike two.  I tend to avoid asking peoples opinions on political matters, no good ever coming from it but somehow, in 2020, everything became political.  I responded by simply not asking anyone about anything that would touch politics.  Conversations became shallow, meaningless and <mark>forced</mark>.  “Hows the job?”- resulted in mask policy, their opinion on masks,….. “How are the kids?”- schools in hybrid mode, pandemic is fake,…. “What are you doing this weekend?”- traveling out of state to attend a 300 person wedding.  Eventually you find the only safe topic: the weather.  Despite a focused intent to avoid topics that result in pandemic policies, people offer information you wish you didn’t hear.  It’s kind of like hearing someone you care about deliver an extraordinarily racist joke.  You can’t unhear it, you’ll never see them the same ever again, and you didn’t want to be part of it.  That’s how it feels when you realize that those closest to you have been masquerading as an intelligent, caring, ‘good’ person for decades.  For months, I attributed this to being ill-informed, people (myself included) aren’t well-versed in biology, medicine or virus transmissions.  Our general knowledge is ‘wash your hands with soap’ without knowing how it affects the ‘viral coat’, nor do we need to understand it if we simply trust experts who advise it.  But, in time, it became clear that knowledge isn’t the issue.  GI Joe was wrong for all those years, the “more you know” ideology was stopped in it’s tracks by a mountain range of selfishness.

It would be a disservice to discuss 2020 without speaking to the killing of George Floyd.  The world that I knew was the one I experienced, I respected law enforcement and had my share of being on the wrong side of the law in which I was never, ever unjustly targeted.  I stole some pens from our local department store, cops got me.  Doing 70 in a 55 mph, cops got me.  U-turn coming directly out of a bar, <mark>blow</mark>ing in a breathalyzer from the back seat.   I had my share of encounters, sometimes I got off, sometimes I didn’t, every single time I was guilty and never have I ever experienced unjustified physical engagement.  We are a product of our experiences, while numbers of folks talk about racial injustices the stories come from strangers who may not be honest in their telling.  People lie, to others and themselves.  I continue to be sickened, saddened and enraged at that killing and I am eternally grateful to the existence of the video.  Had that video not existed, I would have never believed it took place the way it did.  George Floyd is the Emmet Till of this century, how you respond to witnessing such an execution definitively sorts you either the 1) human being, or 2) racist sociopath bucket.  My political party chose their bucket and a feeling of shame and rage enveloped me.   

So, tell me, what do you do?  What do you do when people that you felt share your values show you a side of them you don’t want to see?  Grandma drops the N-word; do you still love her?  Is she just ignorant, “didn’t mean it”, “grew up in a different time”…..or are you grasping for excuses for something unexcusable?  Suppose you were a childhood friend of “Convicted Rapist Brock Turner”, do you continue to send him Christmas cards and continue relations with him but never, ever, ever leave him alone with your daughter.  Where is the line and is the general disregard for public safety part of the line?  Please, I’m begging you, tell me because I DON’T KNOW.  I make a living making complex decisions, I’ve been a part of company leadership making decisions that affect a large number of employee’s livelihoods.  I’m no stranger to difficult choices/decisions; but, this, this right here is too fucking hard;  AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!

My neighbor, a pastor of a local church exchanging frustration and anger to a government that is preventing his livelihood.  Massive churches hosting spreader events exchanging a collection plate for a buffet-style luncheon with a side of epidemic.  They proudly dismiss true science for statements of “God will protect me” and “I don’t fear death, I know where I’m going”.  Must have glossed over the ‘thou should not kill’ commandment like it doesn’t apply to them.  Into the bucket they go.

Another neighbor professing the ‘unhealthiness of masks’ at even casual encounters.  “I know, I’m a high school science teacher” seems to somehow attempt to establish her credentials, but instead only draws the question of the competency of such teachers.  Like an overfull garbage can, you gingerly place this person in the ‘idiot bucket’ and firmly press down in an attempt to make room.

I wish it ended with masks, but it doesn’t.  As 2020 comes to an end, the 2021 coup and all that it entails.  I’ve been hiding away from peoples opinions, now 9 months from any meaningful social interactions that isn’t strictly with my wife.  My family, not only pretending the pandemic doesn’t exist, but seemingly going out of their way to spread it.  So we avoid them, talk on the phone, turn down numerous invitations and endure hearing about their recent attempts to spread this virus.   Chatter of disgust for George Floyd protest/mobs from friends and family were abundant, but the coup is met with dead silence from the same people.  \*sigh

Countless folks racing the clock, working feverishly to provide a vaccination, finally available to a select few and I’m met with a surprise.  One of my family members, who works in elderly care, a registered nurse, the mother of two beautiful boys and the caregiver of my 80+ year old parents just recently let me know that she chose not to take the vaccine. Someone I thought I once knew, someone well-versed in health care, simply decides “nah, fuck that.” How do I respond, how do I ever see this person as the ‘loving caring being’ I once did?  How do you ever trust their professional opinion when it’s clearly based on some other reality?

This isn’t about one person, or a dozen people, it’s about society.  My 2020 started with me believing that people are good, slowly transforming to most are good, then some are good, then those around me are good, to nobody is good.  I no longer trust anyone but my wife, I live with her 24/7 and her actions align with her beliefs, which align with my new found beliefs.  People are selfish, self-serving, hypocrite assholes who lie and cheat their way when faced with an extraordinary difficult situation.  Mama bears that would ‘kill for their children’ will also send them into a school burning with an epidemic after a couple months of home schooling.  Daddies will send their children into a petri-dish daycare to maintain their existing lifestyles.  People storm a high school gymnasium and demand sports so their average little tyke can fumble around on the basketball court like a court jester.  Company leadership will push relentlessly to get employees back into seats despite a real need as long as they are absolved from all responsibility for their actions.  People will press their knee into the back of a handcuffed man until he stops breathing, especially when there are no witnesses.   

A party I once prided with logic and sound reasoning is fleeing from science like a vampire at daybreak.  This year, a turning point for me, while I once proudly voted Republican for decades I cast my unilateral vote against the party who no longer represents the values I once held dear.  The clear disregard of science, logic and reason for a bunch of clowns behaving like children.     

No party immune to selfishness, Democrats and Republicans alike pushing their kids, strangers, friends and family alike into harmful situations.  Each masking their sociopathic behaviors with meme-style factoids or hiding their true selves by not being honest about their actions until the ugliness is drawn out explicitly.  It all feels like a science experiment gone awry, a world-scale Milgram experiment with fatal consequences.  People have become the monsters I never imagined, wielding a general disregard with killing others and their loved ones in a game of viral Russian Roulette.  They should at least have the decency of using a 30-chamber revolver, taking turns to spin the barrel and pull the trigger at each of their loved ones before pulling on themselves; \~3% chance of survival, the odds these psychos seem comfortable with.  We all await our true sentence will come from the long-term affects in the form of brain damages.  Justice, in whatever form, needs to be served, people need to be held responsible for their actions.

I’m exhausted, angry and disappointed.  I’m embarrassed in my country, embarrassed in my government, embarrassed by my friends, embarrassed of my family.  Each week brings a new discovery of someone I once trusted behaving in a reckless, uncaring manner.  I’m depressed, like any rational being that isn’t ostriching this situation, and hopeless for the future.  I’m confident this epidemic will pass by the efforts of the few, but my faith in people, friends and family will forever be a fatality of 2020.  The pandemic went on too long resulting in pulling back the veil of society to reveal the monsters we truly are.  Our responsibility was small, while the ‘firefighters’ struggle to retain the epidemic our responsibility was simply to “not fan the blaze” and “not flick lite cigarettes into the surrounding tinder”; stay home, if you can’t put a piece of cloth on your face.  Instead, we became arrogant dicks who wish to be viewed as ‘brave’ and ‘unfearful’ of the virus, rather they are the true arsonists inciting the world to burn.

In a wave of amnesia I could simply pretend people aren’t stupid, selfish killing machines in the same way I could pretend in the existence of Santa Claus, but I can’t/won’t/shouldn’t.  My religion long left me, but if a giant invisible spaghetti monster has the power to hand out invitations for eternal bliss or damnation, I hope it uses a “what did you do to protect others during the pandemic of 2020” pass/fail one-question test for entry.  Maybe none of us are worthy of a passing grade.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">The last 4 years of my life have been an absolute shitshow.

I started dating a guy when I was 17, he led me to believe he was 19, but he was really 23. We ended up having sex. I told him to use a condom, he said no, I told him to pull out, he did not. That was the first time we had done anything.
At the time, I was upset by it, but I believed myself to be so in love with him that I stayed, barely 5 weeks later, we find out I&#x27;m pregnant.


This breaks me, I&#x27;m just starting my senior year of high school, I want to go to college, I&#x27;m poor enough without having a child, and my parents can&#x27;t possibly help. I&#x27;m too young to terminate it in my state.


He keeps pressuring me to terminate, or self terminate, but when I can&#x27;t do that, he gets mad. He starts verbally and emotionally abusing me, using my body when I beg him to just leave me alone, I stay and I take it.


I find out that he has infected me with an std,  he blames it on me even though I had only had one other partner, who had also been a Virgin.


I work 3 jobs while he sits at home and plays video games, he spends my money on fun and alcohol while I&#x27;m just barely making enough to keep us in our apartment.


I try to leave, he tells me no one else will love me with my 7months pregnant belly and nobody will want used goods. I believe him, so I stay.


I turn 18, and I graduate. 2 days later I&#x27;m giving birth. Hes in the room but he&#x27;s playing on his phone while I&#x27;m pushing a child out that I didn&#x27;t even want to have, that I never wanted to be in the position of having. I had chosen adoptive parents, I meet them, he doesn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re kind and well-off, so I know this baby boy will have the best life he can. I&#x27;m sad, because I ended up bonding with him, but I can&#x27;t keep him on my own, and I refuse to subject him to a man who doesn&#x27;t want him.


I convince myself that everything&#x27;s fine, I get PPD on top of my regular bipolar depression, I had been diagnosed as autistic shortly before the pregnancy, and I&#x27;m struggling with everything. He yells at me to clean the house while I&#x27;m still working 3 jobs and desperately trying to keep up with college classes. He finally finds a part time job, and keeps the money to himself. 


I drop out of school, and get a better-paying full time job with benefits, working for the state. I&#x27;m able to medicate myself and get the help I need. He had secured a position there as well, saw the money was good, and told me to apply. He decides that my check will continue being the bills money, and his will be the fun money. He <mark>blow</mark>s most of his check on alcohol that I legally cannot drink. I drink anyway.


He leaves for work one day and I take 1 of my pain pills left over from a surgery, and I take 4 shots of alcohol. I didn&#x27;t mean to attempt suicide, but I almost die that night.  I remember waking up, him slapping my face, he&#x27;s screaming at me for being a drug addict. All I wanted to do was sleep peacefully for once. After this, I decide to use my benefits, I use my health insurance to check myself into an inpatient hospital. I call him every day, but he rarely answers. I had alienated all of my friends because he had deemed them bad influences. I don&#x27;t have anyone else.


I am released, I go back to work, my job gave me a written note saying that they wouldn&#x27;t fire me for my hospital stay. They lied. They gave me an official letter that states I wasn&#x27;t providing adequate care for residents, but my boss mentions that maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have had so many absences.


I get a job at a restaurant, and go back to one of my old jobs, as I had worked there for 2 years before he convinced me to work with him. They welcome me back with open arms. I am once again working 2 jobs to pay the bills. One day, on the way home, we closed a little late, and he starts <mark>blow</mark>ing up my phone. I look at the screen for a second, and look back up, and I&#x27;m too close to another car, I rear end her. This was both mine and his only vehicle. 


Instead of being worried about me, he berates me for almost totalling the car. We keep driving it, even though the airbag had deployed, because I couldn&#x27;t file a claim due to my car insurance not having a grace period, and the fact that I had pennies to my name. I find out later that my radiator has a hole through it, I keep driving it hot because I can&#x27;t afford to get it fixed. I buy discount parts and ask my brother to put them in. But by then it was too late. I&#x27;d been driving it on hot for 6 months. My head gasket is <mark>blow</mark>n.


During this time we had been breaking up and getting back together a lot, I had entered in a new lease so even when we weren&#x27;t together, I had to stay there, we had roommates. They saw how he treated me and said nothing, even when it got physical. I was shoved through a wall. I had a mysterious tumble down the stairs that gave me a concussion bad enough that I had hallucinations. I was not taken to the hospital.


A few months later, I go to a birthday party, we are in an off period, I meet a guy I really like, we talk, hook up a few times, we hit it off really well. He knows about my situation,  he fixes my car.  He gives me a light to look towards. 


The friend who&#x27;s birthday party I went to, has been staying at my house a lot, complaining about her relationship. Whenever she stays over, she sleeps in my baby daddy&#x27;s room. I went to the bathroom once, and passed his room, and I heard creaking and moaning. At this moment I&#x27;m glad I have my own room finally.


And then my baby daddy threatens to kick me out, take my car, and empty my bank account if I don&#x27;t break it off with &quot;whoever I&#x27;m talking to&quot;. I&#x27;m scared of him, but I don&#x27;t want to,, I ask my friend what I should do,, she tells me that my bd really loves me,, and I should stay with him and break the guy from her birthday party&#x27;s heart,, so I do. 


One month later, I&#x27;ve finally had enough, I leave, I pack my stuff, take most everything I had in that house, and leave. My so called best friend helps.


A week later, I reconnect with the guy from the birthday party. He still wants me, and still cares, so we get back into it. He admits that after I broke up with him, 2 days after, my so called best friend had called him over &quot;as a friend&quot; and slept with him. He cries about it. I don&#x27;t forgive him, but I don&#x27;t condemn him. I&#x27;m mostly mad at her, she knew I had been crying over him. She had convinced me to stay with my baby daddy. Suddenly I don&#x27;t have any friends.


I escaped right at the start of covid, I stay in between my parents house, and my new boyfriends house. I am emotionally scarred, and I have a hard time with talking and making my emotions clear. He is insecure and he gets upset about my past, I let him be mad, because he let&#x27;s me be mad about things when I need to. But it doesn&#x27;t stop. It carves a rift. We start fighting. I feel unloved and unwanted. I feel like its my fault. 


He barely talks to me when I&#x27;m not with him, I beg him for that connection and comraderie, but he doesn&#x27;t want to give it. I am unhappy. 

I don&#x27;t know what to do. I feel like all of this happened because I slept with the wrong person, because I wasn&#x27;t more forceful about not letting him cum in me. I don&#x27;t want to be alive.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">... &amp; why experiencing &quot;ego death&quot; can be one of the most liberating or terrifying feelings for an individual, by F.K.

# Intro: What is &quot;the ego&quot; and the &quot;ego trap&quot;?

Even though it&#x27;s a bit hard for some people to grasp the concept of the human ego, in plain words, the ego is an abstract concept, a social construct that we as individuals develop consciously or subconsciously throughout our lives. It’s an image created in our mind which is deluded into looking at itself as a “separate” entity. It&#x27;s something like a reflection of yourself and your personality, talents, experiences and abilities and it&#x27;s the way you portray those to the outer world. Your ego is who you believe and portray yourself to be, showcasing an image of yourself to the outer world and molding your way on how others perceive you. It’s a result of the influence of all the *external* factors and social norms that were brought upon you throughout your lifetime.

However; many people fall in the &#x27;ego trap&#x27;, which in its core is just a lens of duality over the real world. Instead of seeing life as it is, the ego tends to divide concepts into two opposite sides: left and right, right and wrong, love and hate, peace and war. These divisions bring suffering to our lives and instead of seeing everyone as equals, the ego forces us to categorize others and compare ourselves to them; making greater and lesser people based on their achievements or social status, experiences, thoughts and emotions. This creates internal conflict that can be detrimental, especially in nurturing relationships with other people.

Going from understanding the concept of the &quot;ego&quot;, then *actually realizing* that you have a developed/inflated ego, to making a strong character breakdown by objectively analyzing your traits in order to dissolve the very same ego, is a wild ride that requires some objective and serious self-analysis which one can only achieve if they reached higher consciousness, swallowed their pride and hit emotional rock bottom. That is where I was for a couple of weeks after this woman decided to leave.

## Hidden Ego

Lets change course for a bit. Being an over-achiever for my age (and no, this isn&#x27;t my ego speaking), I was finding myself constantly comparing myself to people that were more successful than me. I always aimed really high and took opportunities; this is why I&#x27;ve earned above-average amounts of money in my mid-twenties. In fact, just as my teenage years came to an end, I was making good buck without knowing what capitalism actually is or even how it works. It turns out that this can be dangerous in some ways; let me explain why. As time passed, I was listening to and was surrounded with people that were more successful than me (24/7). Over time, this gave me a bitter taste of an inferiority complex instead of increased motivation. It has subconsciously planted a small seed in my mind that always made me doubt my self-worth and abilities to some extent, even though I was the most successful guy in my circle. But then as I grew I realized that, in fact, &quot;success&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;wealth&quot;; a rather unusual realization that struck me, since our society mostly characterizes money, power/social status and fame as &quot;success&quot;. From that very realization, I found myself being the total opposite of a materialist and some internal struggle did start to manifest inside of me because I was lacking purpose in life at the time.

Fast forward to the stressful Covid19 era during the last 12 months, my career started to go downhill. The revenue coming in from multiple sources was slowing down and I reached a point where I found myself completely living off of my life savings. In addition, being prone to anxiety and depression from the past (after finding out the side effects of antidepressants that I&#x27;ve been taking for some time, I have managed to beat and control my anxiety/depression/OCD on my own without meds, even helped my mom go through it), my mental health took a beating again which resulted in me overthinking everyday situations in order to make sure I&#x27;m on the right track because there was no room for error anymore. However, my friends and peers had still kept the same perception of me, the &quot;successful positive guy&quot;, while I was actually slowly falling down. This is where I subconsciously started to gradually feed my ego, because I couldn&#x27;t &quot;accept defeat&quot; so to speak, even temporary. You know, the &#x27;&#x27;ruined reputation&#x27;&#x27; crap. I was **subconsciously** *not* comfortable in my own skin when I went to bed each night, but I was simply ignoring it and I was &quot;postponing the addressing&quot; of the feeling. Speaking from a new viewpoint now, I can say that I was not comfortable with my true self to some extent when I was alone. But in social situations I kept portraying the same old me that people knew, at least most of the time. This actually can, and, in fact, **did** reduce my self-esteem without me realizing it because it was hidden underneath the evolving ego. And that is dangerous. So, what &quot;woke&quot; me up?

## The Woman

Well, when I get involved and invest time with a potential partner, my true self comes to light. All of my strengths and vulnerabilities, even those deeply engraved in my character. I subconsciously present my true self and my real values to the partner -- but you remember what I said about how I was feeling about myself at the time, right? Trying to mask these feelings off in front of her was a mistake. But I do *not* blame myself; I mean, who would want to share and listen to these problems during a fresh &amp; early dating phase? This progressed with me being not comfortable during intimate situations; I was not relaxed, sometimes even not present in the moment, and it ended up being a vicious cycle of anxious overthinking. I&#x27;m pretty sure she noticed it as well, but didn&#x27;t want to bring it on the table. For some reason it felt like I &quot;cheated my way to success&quot; with this woman, while at the same time I grew very fond of her. Of course, with the masked anxious state of my mind, the &#x27;&#x27;performance anxiety&#x27;&#x27; comes to light in the bedroom. This was amplified by the fact that she was more sexually mature and experienced than me (she was 12 years older) and I felt strong pressure for underdelivering in the bedroom. You see how the ego crawls underneath and those little self-doubt seeds appear when you least want them to? I was comparing myself to her previous sexual partners/experiences and failed to acknowledge my qualities and self-worth and what I bring on the table, and thus, subtly ignoring my wants and needs. I&#x27;m not sure if she perceived this attitude of mine, but I&#x27;m guessing she had a feeling that I was not comfortable with my sexuality, which was not true at all.

The turning point for me was definitely her statement saying that she feels like I&#x27;m &quot;asexual&quot;. Imagine the anger and resentment I felt when hearing the woman I adored calling me asexual. It&#x27;s a <mark>blow</mark> to ones self-esteem beyond explanation. Even though this was far from the first woman I&#x27;ve dated or had success with, it was definitely the first time I&#x27;ve been called asexual, and since I valued her opinion slightly above-average, mostly because of the extra life experience she had, I knew it was time for some real and objective self-evaluation. But at that point I was so overwhelmed that I **did not** want to stay sober.

So, being an intellectual myself, I struggled to understand why, even after couple of weeks, I was still engaging in self-destructive practices and abused drugs over a woman who I&#x27;ve known for only \~2 months. Especially since I was consciously aware that this behavior is even more detrimental to my mental and physical health on the long run. This was when I realized that, in fact, it wasn&#x27;t actually *me* who was emotionally hurt, but it was rather, *my ego*. This was a pretty wild realization, since I&#x27;ve been living my whole life thinking that I am the least egoistic person out there. You see, the Ego is there to &quot;protect you&quot; from the outer world and the ego does not want to let go of its negative thoughts because it feels defeated in doing so. And when the Ego is hurt, or when its shell is broken, the Ego tries to find a way to soothe itself: drugs, alcohol, binge eating or watching Netflix; but soothing the Ego is just a temporary fix. This Ego, unless you let go of it, will find reasons to get hurt again and again, and you&#x27;ll have to go through the same cycle of suffering all over again. The only way to get off the cycle of suffering is to stop entertaining the Ego and see that all hurt only stems from a “story” in the mind. But remember, getting your Ego hurt is a good thing, because once it gets deconstructed, your true self and what lies beneath will shine.

Remember:

* *Its okay not to perform at your best*
* *Its okay to acknowledge failure, even temporary*
* *Its okay to feel pain, suffering is inevitable part of life and the foundation of human evolution*
* *Its NOT okay to suppress emotions, allow yourself to feel, it&#x27;s the only way to grow*

While I have no regrets about how the whole experience unfolded because I&#x27;ve grown so much from it, I *wouldn&#x27;t* change anything if I could go back in time because there wouldn&#x27;t be any lessons learned. Instead, if I got to choose I&#x27;d probably choose another woman to learn this experience from, but the thing is, it&#x27;s not only that we **DON&#x27;T** get the luxury to choose such option, we also pay big prices for big lessons in life. This was mine.

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m feeling helpless.

I&#x27;ve had a difficult past. I (26f) was bullied half of my life by family members, classmates and supposed &quot;friends&quot;. 

I&#x27;m an only child, my parents had married some years before I was born. My grandmother hated every woman who set her sight on one of his precious boys and terrorised my mom, but, fortunately, my dad was no momma&#x27;s boy. Still, his relatives&#x27; influence was the only reason of arguments between my mom and dad. My grandmother and uncles were very manipulative and even tried to sabotage my relationship with my parents. So there was a constant cold war, I couldn&#x27;t trust anyone.

When I was in 7th grade, one of my supposed friends betrayed me. She discovered she had cancer, her parents were poor and they didn&#x27;t afford to pay for her treatment. So she has told everyone that I was beating her and the beating caused her illness, so my parents must assume the financial responsability for her treatment. It was bulls**t, but many people from the village we lived in believed her, even though it could have been proven easily that her illness couldn&#x27;t been provoked by some (inexistent!) <mark>blow</mark>s. I wasn&#x27;t a violent child. My classmates used to follow me after class, they threw stones at me and called me a criminal, a murderer. &quot;Why won&#x27;t you die instead of her?&quot;, they said.

Eventually, the truth came out, her parents found out another source of money and she was cured, but our community pardoned them easily.

In high school, the bullying continued. I was considered &quot;the weird one&quot;, &quot;the depressed, the emo&quot;, just because I wore black and I listened to rock music.  I was suspected of self-harm, even through it wasn&#x27;t true. I was talking to the school psychologist, but it didn&#x27;t help me much. One of the bullies was the principal&#x27;s nephew. If I tried to talk to someone with influence, I was considered a liar or even &quot;an attention wh**e&quot;, even though I was a low-profile kind of girl. Even my parents thought I was the problem. I just wanted a normal life, some friends, peace, tranquility. So I buried myself in books and focused on studying. I thought that college will be different. 

When I started college, it felt... promising. I&#x27;ve made aquintances and friends, I started going out, I felt happy and included for the first time. But my friends kept changing, many of my friends became involved in stuff I didn&#x27;t have any interest in (drugs, alcohol, casual s*x). So I changed groups quite often. 

In my second year of college, the worst thing happened. One of my aquintances raped me. I was at a party with some friends, but they soon abandoned me. I was left alone with the rapist and another guy, who soon left the appartment to &quot;buy some cigarettes&quot;. I thought it was weird, so I grabbed my coat and went to the door, but the piece of human garbage bloched and locked the door.

It was my first s*xual experience. 

I felt dirty, used, worthless, because I couldn&#x27;t defend myself. I wasn&#x27;t <mark>drunk</mark>. But still, I didn&#x27;t have enough physical force to fight him. It was horrible. I could not help but think: &quot;I could hit him in the head with that, but what if he dies and I go to prison?&quot;?

I escaped. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t become pregnant or catch some STD. 

I didn&#x27;t go to the police. He was famous in those times, he threatened me to make me appear as an &quot;attention wh**e&quot;, he told me that his word has more value than mine, he had connections...

 I stopped going to college. I couldn&#x27;t concentrate anymore, the left side of my face was paralysed, my hair turned white, I could not speak properly, I had nightmares... My parents found out and were dissapointed because I dropped out of college, especially my father. Sometimes, my mother would empathise, but sometimes she would blame me for what happened.

After two years of therapy (I was diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression) and work, I resumed my studies, I met new people, my relationship with my parents was going better, I convinced them to see a psychiatrist (they were both diagnosed with depression). I also met a guy who became my friend and later my boyfriend. He knew my past and he seemed to truly care about me. He helped me getting over the trauma, we supported and trusted each other. 

After a year and a half of relationship, I found out he was cheating with his ex. He gave me an STD which he has taken from his ex. She called me and told me everything, he was beside me. She tried to play the victim, but she knew of my existence from the beggining. I talked to him, he admitted everything. He said he did it &quot;because he&#x27;s weak and stupid&quot;. &quot;I was in bed with her, I was thinking about you and I was hating myself&quot;. No apology. I left him immediatly. I&#x27;m healthy right now - luckily, the disease wasn&#x27;t incurable.

I finished college, I have a steady job, got my own house, a good relationship with my parents, a cat, but sometimes I feel alone. I&#x27;m 26, I have no friends (just colleagues, aquintances). I almost forgot how a kiss feels like. After the breakup, I focused on college, on gaining independence, but I want to love and be loved. I&#x27;m tired of people who recommend me to find one-night-stands or a f**k buddy, that&#x27;s not what I want. The years are going by, I go out, I used dating apps, but it&#x27;s sad that no one wants to know me or to let me know them. It&#x27;s all about &quot;your place or mine?&quot;. I refused those offers.

I don&#x27;t know what to do, how to change this situation. I&#x27;m tired of being considered old-fashioned only because I want an exclusive, commited relationship. I don&#x27;t think &quot;all men are p*gs&quot; after my past experiences. I always try to work with myself, to become a better person. But I don&#x27;t want to be seen only as a conquest. Or as &quot;worthless&quot;. I won&#x27;t change what I want and what I am as a person in order to be accepted.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Hi, this is my first post on reddit so if formatting or whatever is bad, I apologize. I&#x27;m going to be 20 years old soon, and I&#x27;ve been homeless for about 2 months now. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of suicide, like most do, but I just wanted to give a rundown of my life story and maybe get suggestions on possible next steps. 

I was an ordinary white (yes it matters later) kid with ADD living in some middle of nowhere town in Ohio. Nothing was wrong, my parents still loved me and I had friends from the small town school I went to. This story really kicks off in 2009 (I was born in 2000 so you can assume I&#x27;ll be 9 here). My dad had just lost his job of over 2 decades at a newspaper company due to a merger, and we were in pretty dire straits financially speaking, since my mom at the time was the only one working part time at a hospital. He spent the next few weeks looking for a job in the field, and came across a place on the big island of Hawaii. This is the beginning of a long string of jobs that took him out of the picture for a year at a time. He moved, and we stayed back in our little town.

Things were good for a while, but one of the first memorable instances of abuse I can remember is during that summer. We had gone to the state fair that week and I got to make one of those two colored ropes they sell made of horse hair. Cut to noon, I&#x27;m just sitting on the floor playing with my legos minding my own business. Mom kicks open the door and is yelling about something I cant remember, and she grabs whatever was nearby to &#x27;punish&#x27; me, which just so happened to be the fraying horse hair rope I&#x27;d hung in my closet. Needless to say, it hurt. It was such a weird concept to me, but I remember she had this fire in her eyes, like she was a lion staring down a hunter that killed its cub (I could use a better analogy but you get the point) as she just kept whipping, and whipping. Eventually she stopped and told me to clean up the room before leaving. For the first time in my life, I was truly afraid of my mother. 

I started locking my door that night. I was never a kid that needed tucked in at night, so she never checked up on me unless she was angry about something and needed to set the record straight. One night after 5th grade started, she tried the door and found it was locked. I went to school the next day and came back to the handle missing. I asked her why that was, and she said I&#x27;m not allowed to lock the door because she needed to get in there in case of emergencies. For most kids, this would make sense, as it&#x27;s a legitimate concern for fires and whatnot, so I didn&#x27;t push the topic. 

I wasn&#x27;t great in school. Probably had a learning disability or something like that, but my parents never believed in mental illness so I was never tested. Report cards came in and I was failing some classes. I came home and she rushed me at the door, picking me up by the armpits and taking me to her room. She rips my backpack off of me and throws me on the bed, my face taking the impact hard enough to get a bloody nose. I heard a belt buckle behind me and she started yelling at me telling me to count up from 0, and to explain why I was receiving each <mark>blow</mark>. Unlike most parents, she didnt use the leather on me, instead opting for the buckle itself.
One <mark>blow</mark>. &quot;Now what was that one for?&quot;
I had no idea why this was happening, and she didnt explain throughout this encounter.
Second <mark>blow</mark>, this time hitting just above my butt. &quot;WE&#x27;RE STILL ON ONE. WHAT WAS IT FOR?&quot;
Now crying, I yelled that I didnt know. I heard the rustling of paper and she shoved the report card in my face.
Third <mark>blow</mark>, this one on my leg. &quot;Still on one. What was it for?&quot;
I screamed through the blood and snot covering my face &quot;FOR A BAD GRADE&quot;
&quot;Good.&quot;
Fourth <mark>blow</mark>.
Fifth.
That&#x27;s all 3 of my failing grades, but I covered my ass with my hands this time, and was curling up on the bed.
&quot;Don&#x27;t cover your ass, or I&#x27;ll hit somewhere else&quot;
I couldn&#x27;t hear her clearly, I was screaming and in pain
Six. This time on my back.
I cover my head
Seven. Again on the back. 
I don&#x27;t remember the rest, and you get the idea. But my nose was gushing the whole time. The sun was going down through the window and she finally let&#x27;s up. She finally sees the blood on her bed. 
&quot;Take my bedding to the laundry room. You&#x27;re cleaning up the mess you made.&quot;

From that day on, I started developing a pretty nasty flinch to people making movements near me. Nobody ever picked up on something going on at home. Less memorable things happened, but none as severe as that for the next 2 years.

At some point, my mom took me to a therapist. I dont remember the circumstances surrounding it, but it&#x27;s important to note some things that happened in the sessions. I was never alone in the room. And half of the time mom would be talking to the therapist about what a problematic child I was. When asked about my views on the topic, I would tell her about all the things mom did to me when she was angry, but when my mom denied it, the therapist scolded me for lying about my mother, and that since she&#x27;s my mother I should love her and not question her parenting because she has my best interests in mind. I believed her.

In 2010, dad quit the job in Hawaii and moved back to live with us, and things calmed down for the next few months until he found another job. This time in Kentucky. He moved again, and again mom started getting aggressive with me. Nothing too crazy to note, but on my 11th birthday (2011), I was told that we were moving to live with dad the next day. Without any warning, no phone, no computer, I had to move 6 hours away with no way to talk to my friends back home. 

6 months this time. Dad quit his job in favor of a management position in Columbus Ohio. This move was different though, but before I tell you about it, I need to explain the layout of the house. It was a 2 story place, the first floor had nothing but hard wood floors and the second floor was all carpet from the bottom of the stairs and into me and my sister&#x27;s bedrooms. When dad moved, mom convinced him to take all of the furniture, excluding the mattress for a futon, a recliner, and a card table with some chairs.

After everything was said and done, mom ordered a cleaner service to clean the upstairs carpet. She was pretty adamant that nobody was allowed to walk up there (even with clean socks) because it needed to stay clean. What did this mean for me? The only thing that I could sleep on was the futon, but my mom insisted that my sister (who from this point will be a rather large part of the story) be the one that gets to sleep with her on the mattress. She told me that I was allowed to have a blanket and pillow and sleep on the floor in the closet (also hard wood). This would go on to cause back problems and other &quot;<mark>sleeping</mark> on wood&quot; related issues, but that isn&#x27;t the worst of it. Fast forward to the summer, we&#x27;ve been living like this for about 9 months at this point, and mom has been moreso cold and irritable than aggressive. Every day before school I was supposed to be ready an hour before we left, and to sit on the bottom step quietly so that my sister could get that &quot;bonus hour&quot; of sleep. When I got home every day, there was no food and nobody home, so I would just do homework and sleep to pass the time. This would be the start of another long standing issue. Every day mom would pick my sister up from school and take her out to eat. I was told to take the bus home and stay there for 3 hours until they got home because I &quot;could not be in public&quot;. I would go days without eating and felt sick all the time. Even at school they wouldn&#x27;t let me get lunch because my account had a block on it, courtesy of mother dearest.

Now we get to the most memorable scene of physical abuse, that ironically, she claims she doesn&#x27;t remember. It&#x27;s an average school night, I&#x27;m <mark>sleeping</mark> in the closet with school to get to in the morning. I wake up, I think at 3am? To the closet door bursting open. She&#x27;s standing there, a silhouette to the moonlit room holding a container. She starts ranting and raving about something I cant remember because I want even processing that I had woken up yet. My attention is grabbed, however, when I feel something blunt hit my back, sending a wave of pain through my already pain addled 12 year old body. I start crying, and roll toward her to look at her, and I&#x27;m greeted by another hit to my ribs. I realize she&#x27;s kicking me. She keeps kicking in quick succession and I can feel one of my ribs cracking. That&#x27;s when I&#x27;m hit in the face by something sweet smelling. I try to get a breath in and start choking on the powder, and the taste floods my mouth. I&#x27;m still being kicked and through the tears I can see her reach into the container, grabbing a handful of the stuff, and it hits me in the eyes. This goes on and on until my face is coated in whatever it was, I&#x27;d turned onto my side at some point and she slowly stopped kicking my stomach. I don&#x27;t remember much else after that. I lay there crying for what felt like hours, but eventually passed out. She never took me to the hospital for the ribs, but I remember it being horrible just to breathe in too much. I&#x27;d never told the school about it because of what the therapist told me, and i just kept taking the abuse until we moved again. 

Spring of 2013. We move to a fairly nice suburban area of Columbus. Dad is making big bucks from the new job. I should note that he&#x27;s always been a kind father, never blew up at me, never hit me, anything like that. But when we moved to Columbus, I told him everything that had happened. This is the second big contributor to why the abuse had gone on for so long. He asked mom if it were true, and of course, she denied it. He got this look in his eye. He sits me down and gives me this talk about how shes my mother and that I shouldn&#x27;t lie like that, and that I was making it up. This wouldn&#x27;t change, and still hasn&#x27;t. 

If you know anything about Columbus city schools, you&#x27;d know that as a little white kid living in a semi-decent area of town, I was going to be a target. Since the day I started school, I was beaten up on the walks I had to make home because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to ride the bus (one of those zero tolerance stories I&#x27;ll save for another day). Just a bunch of punk kids trying to look tough by beating up the &quot;rich white kid&quot;. But even though we were living in a nice house, with dad making a fair amount of money, there still wasn&#x27;t food at home. I was still going days without eating, the same block was on my lunch account, and mom and dad always ate out. Mom always had money in my sister&#x27;s lunch account so she could get breakfast and lunch at school, and always got her food when she would go out. I was severely underweight and was still having back problems from the months in the closet. I didnt have any friends at this school, and was all around laughed at and picked on for my hobbies (Pokémon and other nerdy shit) and my skin color. 

7 months go by and the same school treatment continues. Again, there aren&#x27;t any crazy encounters with mom, but something to note, she would slap, punch, or kick me for talking either in the car, or in a store, or anywhere that wasn&#x27;t inside my home, where I spent as much time as I could in my room. To this day I&#x27;ll still flinch at someone going to shake my hand because of the bruises and pain of the years to come. 

My parents decided to move again after not too long. Just a different side of Columbus, but in a new school district. This was a 2 bedroom apartment in a worse side of the area. To give you an idea, while I was attending my 8 months at this school there were 3 individual stabbings in the bathrooms, and more than a fair amount of gang violence in a middle school of all places. Another fun fact that would throw me on the floor at this school, is that I had just come from their RIVAL school. I didnt know anything about football teams and rivalries because at that point I gave up on caring about the schools I went to or the students attending, as I knew we would just move around every year. This would get me into several fights in and out of school with anyone that cared about the football teams there. There was even a teacher there that would tell me to &quot;go back to the other school&quot;. 

I, a 13 year old boy going through puberty, had to share a cramped room in this apartment with my sister, who I should mention is just one year younger than I am. The abuse from our mom kept coming and I&#x27;d gotten to a point where I started to stop feeling anything. My family preached that mental illness and depression dont exist and that everyone that claimed they have it was just looking for attention, but for the first time in my life, I realized I was depressed. I didnt want to be alive anymore. I&#x27;d long since stopped believing in god or the consequences of suicide, I just wanted it to stop. I&#x27;d stopped making friends after the last school because it wouldn&#x27;t matter by the end of the year if i was just going to move. 

And move we did. The beginning of my first year of high school came around in 2013, and my mentality at that point had shifted from &quot;ignore everyone so they don&#x27;t pick fights&quot; to &quot;be the alpha and show everyone you&#x27;re an asshole they should just avoid you&quot;. I know it sounds edgy, but I just didnt want human connection with people that could just hurt me further. Of course, that changed once I started dating.

A new girl every week. I&#x27;d made some friends during my first year that, unfortunately, I&#x27;m still friends with due to later circumstances. But I would pick up girls and throw them away every other week. I thought the attention would be a way to relieve my depression but it just wasn&#x27;t. I ended freshman year talking to this older girl, we&#x27;ll call her Dana. She comes into play in a few years, but remember her as the longest relationship I&#x27;d had thus far. 3 weeks.

I still want eating for days at a time, but there was a pretty busy grocery store on the way home from school (I walked every day). Eventually i decided that i was hungry enough to break a law. So each day i would steal a sandwich and a water bottle (no clean water at the apartment). Of course being a dumb kid, I didnt know all the nuances that go into shoplifting and got caught. I was banned from the store, but the loss prevention guy didnt press charges, so I was at least safe from having it on my record. But after that, I went back to not eating unless my dad brought something home.

Sophomore year goes by. Nothing too exciting. I&#x27;d slowed down on dating that year but that&#x27;s the only thing of note. I was never allowed to have friends over to my house, and once I got home at the end of the school day I was not allowed to go anywhere. Friends thought I was a flake for never hanging out, and I stopped talking to most of them. 

That summer though, I found this girl on a social media platform (I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allowed to say the name but it involves faces and reading). Her name, we can call her Sarah. In typical high schooler fashion, we started dating a week after taking to eachother and for 2 years, we were inseparable. The problem came where neither of us would be allowed to leave the house unless I snuck out and she gave her parents a week&#x27;s notice. Keep this in mind for later.

Junior year comes and goes, I make a few friends but never got a chance to build on it. That summer though, mom started getting worse again. Dad was away more and more, so she had more opportunities to do what she used to. She may have been smaller than me, but she switched tactics after realizing physical abuse didnt hurt as much as it did 3 years ago. To her, I was, among other things, a worthless son that she regrets giving birth too so much that she had a second child that she would love instead. A son that was so bad that I would never amount to anything, and she would make sure I would never go to college, never leave the house, never have friends outside of school, and that I was disrespectful. I should kill myself and save her the trouble of her having to &quot;deal with&quot; me, and nobody would miss me. 

The depression had gone down over the years prior, but when most of my day was spent home alone hearing that, it was back in full force. I started thinking of quick and painless ways to die. I broke up with Sarah because I didnt want her to miss me when i went through with it. I started pushing away what little friends i had and the ones that had stayed around were eventually going to be negative influences on my adult life. I wanted a way out.

Senior year, 2017. I reconnected with Sarah after about half a year and we started going out again. We were together for 5 months before I graduated, and I was 18 by that time. That summer we spent a lot of time together. Fun fact! I was still a virgin at this point, but she kept swearing up and down that it was too early to do anything sexual and to wait. So I did. Soon after graduation I started working for a cable company and found some joy in talking to customers and working with wires. I&#x27;d finally found something that interested me and made me happy. Whenever I could I would visit her at school for lunch and life was okay for a while. Enter 2019. A week after my 19th birthday, the company called for financial layoffs. I was one of them (just my luck)

Then a week later, my grandmother (dad&#x27;s side) was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. And I was driven back to my hometown 3 hours away without a car of my own to take care of her because I was &quot;unemployed and not good for anything else&quot;. I lived with her until July, and Sarah and I had become distant during that time. When i got back i picked up a job at a gas station where the head manager was stealing from the store.

The beginning of the worst 7 months of my life (and it&#x27;s still going.) Started when Sarah started avoiding me and being suspicious with who she was hanging out with. There was this kid we&#x27;ll call Danny that she went to school with. A week prior to this, Danny had proclaimed his love for my girlfriend, and supposedly shot him down. They still spent a lot of time together at his house. One day I was able to hang out with her and she asked me to drive her to a friends house so she could feed his cats while they were on vacation. I asked who &quot;he&quot; is just out of curiosity, and she got really defensive over it but eventually caved and said it was Danny. I took her there and she took a really long time &quot;feeding the cats&quot;. Maybe 20 minutes or so. She&#x27;d asked me to stay in the car because the parents asked her not to bring anyone into their house. This is all reasonable enough, but then I was talking to a friend about it. Backstory on this friend, she&#x27;s close friends with Danny and his family. She asked me to confirm the address and told me that they were in fact NOT on vacation. She&#x27;s the only one that his family asked to feed the cats, and she had been hanging out with them that week. I broke things off with Sarah after over 3 years of being together. Then a week goes by.

I found another job that paid more. I was set to start in a few weeks when out of nowhere mom comes knocking on my door and tells me the words that sent my life into a spiral. &quot;Your father and I are going to a funeral this weekend. You have three days to get your shit packed and if you&#x27;re still here by the time we get back, I&#x27;ll call the police and have you kicked out.&quot;

So I packed everything I could into my car. I called everyone I knew that had their own place and finally got a yes from a couple I was friends with in high school. I won&#x27;t even give them names. 

From August to November, I lived with them without thinking anything was wrong. I came home one day from work and saw an eviction notice on the door, for failure to pay rent. I confronted the girlfriend and she told me that they only had to pay &#x27;some&#x27; of the rent each month because they can&#x27;t legally kick you out if you give them money right?

I asked her where the thousands of dollars I gave them went, and she said she spent it on games for her boyfriend because he didnt have a job and couldn&#x27;t buy his own. 

The very next day I get an email from the company I&#x27;d been with for the past few months. Another financial layoff. So, I see the court order a few days later. The place has to be vacated on new years day. Something I should note is that my name was never on the lease, so I dont have an eviction on my record or anything. 

After that I was without a home for a week, just what I could fit in my car and what I could store at a friend&#x27;s house. After that week, another friend offered to let me stay at his place, but I would have to move out before may. That&#x27;s where i am now.

In the month and a half that&#x27;s gone by this year (2020) I&#x27;ve basically been squatting at his house. My car has broken down twice, costing me over $2000 (that I don&#x27;t have) and I&#x27;m just now starting a job after 3 months. I&#x27;ve been morbidly depressed and have been drinking every weekend with whoever will let me, and have seriously considered suicide twice since the year started. The only reason I didn&#x27;t go through with either one is because my only two close friends have been trying to get me to see a good future ahead of me.

So reddit.. what&#x27;s your opinion here?
I needed something to do today, so I went ahead with this post. 
I&#x27;m going to be 20 at the end of the month (I&#x27;m a leap day baby so that&#x27;s something) and I have absolutely no money saved up and have been struggling to afford even ramen. I&#x27;m starting a job at $15 an hour on Monday but I just dont know where to go from here. I dont have any family that cares about me or talks to me, and I&#x27;ve just got two friends that are barely keeping me together mentally. 
I&#x27;ll be glad to answer any questions you might have, but like the title says, I just keep getting handed lemons and haven&#x27;t had nearly enough sugar to justify it. 

TLDR- I had a shitty home and school life, got kicked out of my parents house and now I&#x27;m living on my friend&#x27;s couch.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I have to type this. Sorry if it becomes too long. I write because it kinda helps me to get rid of shit that haunts my mind. I&#x27;ve never told anyone what I&#x27;m about type. I&#x27;ll tell my family one day. I&#x27;m 22, a good man with a good heart, with an inability to feel worthy and love often. I&#x27;ve developed trust issues, not from relationships ironically. Where do I start. My whole life I&#x27;ve been an outcast. Me and my brother. I was 2 and 3 and I remember when family gatherings were around and the whole family would just forget about me and my infant brother, favoring the cousins(who are absolutely garbage, now) and luckily my mom and dad would still have us close to them, we&#x27;d still get looked after, but the sense of being unwanted and left to the side plants the seed in ones heart to feel unloved. Already, at a young age, I realized I was not very wanted around. I&#x27;d try to talk to everyone, but no. Only one grandmother cared enough to have us around in the end and I&#x27;ll keep wamhat good memories to myself. My parents were always there tho. Growing up into school, I noticed something. I was smaller, weaker, timid, but social. Kids don&#x27;t socialize much at this age, but then again,&quot;nobody wanted to be my friend&quot;. My parents never got me or bro into sports, took a very soft approach which I know now to never do. Those early years of development kids get from sports is crucial in socializing and team work and all kinds of shit. Plus the physical benefits.

 I came from humble beginnings. Getting older into elementary, I learned I was born into a broken family. The stories I heard. One side had royalties in the past related to the &quot;Deans&quot; who apparently owned half of Waco at one point. So the story goes. This family were snobs and foolish with money. The generations that live now are assholes. One is dazzled in millions in Houston and stingy. He never tries to see family. His brothers who&#x27;d be in their 70s are gone or nowhere to be seen. Some were hunters n such. Cool people, I&#x27;d love to have known them. Another in this family is overweight, unhealthy, pretty much done. Two face is what I call her. The other grandmother. If she died I wouldn&#x27;t care. The aunt is trashy, the cousins are in drugs and fucked from early marriages they could not sustain. Yet, this grandmother over them has some money. <mark>Blow</mark>s it and favors the aunt and her shitty kids. My dad is upstanding and killing himself with work, no retirement which I heard was diluted from me and my medical bills being a sick child. He also paid child support from his first marriage. We were broke and just financially fucked. At least my parents were. Anyways, his mother wont help him, who busts his ass, raises good kids, and did her lawn and home improvements for her. Fuck that grandmother. Burn in hell! The other side of my family are country folk and farmers. I dont know much, but they seemed cool. Hunters and such... a good masculine tradition. A tradition and upbringing I never got since my dad was always gone working. Anyways, there was another side to them. I heard of a lot of drug abuse, alcoholics, &#x27;shine runners, and some real bad shit I will not disclose. What a family. A broken family no doubt, but there is worse families beside mine. 

The story goes, my parents were &quot;<mark>forced</mark> in to sports n shit&quot;. So back to me growing up. My parents were very soft on me as a boy. I was outcast at the turn of 3rd grade. No friends and my parents tried to get me and my bro involved in sports, but my confidence and self worth has been shaken. I refuse, so they say okay and baby me to not &quot;force my kids to do things&quot; instead of being role models and preparing me for the real world by saying &quot;get up and dont be weak&quot;. I started liking girls early, but I never knew what to do. I went to my dad. &quot;Everything falls into place, it&#x27;ll come, dont worry about it&quot;. Bullshit, it turned me into a needy beta nice guy as I grew up. No friends, lacking social skills and many questions. I was not properly socialized and encouraged enough. I still tried. It&#x27;s a curse that I&#x27;m logically inclined, which means I must be given handbook on things to work because I need to know everything about how everything works. I was gifted at math, games, and rock music obviously. No confidence at a young age, other kids walked all over me. 5th grade came and I finally fell. The whole 5th grade CLASS, some 100+ kids believed a rumor &quot;I was gay&quot;. I finally tasted depression. No friends, peers thought I was weird, anti social, gay, and bullshit. Ironically, I talked to girls more because my fellow males ostracized me in soccer, recess, you name it. I had my first regret, too. I was mean to the one person who tried to be my friend. I&#x27;m sorry pal. I was on a quest to be popular, of course, so I was judgemental. Middle school, I will summarize. I got real fat, made some friends finally( then turned on me and made a real joke out of me in the end they planned), tried to experiment with &quot;liking&quot; a girl with low confidence and no role modeling on how to flirt and go about interacting with girls. I thought flirting was expressly sexual... I know... I was so wrong! Nobody explained shit to me. The girls were revolted cuz I was fat, caused by no sports, caused by lack of confidence and outcasting. I hated life at this point. No good memories I can think at this point in time. Except when I was being me... childish, alone, and weak. Sad excuse for a boy. No masculinity. End of 8th grade, I tried football and sucked horribly. I have to live with the fact that i caused the &quot;no win season&quot; in that school. I regret ever playing.

I asked my parents, am I fat, do I suck at football, why don&#x27;t have friends, why do girls not like me. &quot;You&#x27;re fine, you&#x27;re not fat, friends and girls will come&quot;. Bullshit, I wasn&#x27;t active, I was socially crippled, unattractive, weak, you name it. Not a young man. Hell I hit puberty late. I blame poor dietary habits and lifestyle at home. 

Back to me. I was bullied emotionally in middle school, girls...GIRLS were trying to tell me I was gay, told me all kinds of shit. Made fun of me. I was so weak, girls walked all over me. No confidence, self esteem, depression, closed off was a result of this shit. I hated life so much. I believed girls didn&#x27;t like me, believed guys didnt think I was cool enough to talk to. Dark thoughts swirled hard!

Summer before high school. Lost my faith. This was what was in my head. Several people I hated, I wanted to kill them. I wanted to cut their head off, paint profanity on their face and body with their own blood, cut their tongue and eyes out and make an effigy out of their heads. I wanted to run them over in a car. I wanted to bring alcohol and dowse one in it and light a match and burn them alive. I wanted to drive pencils all in their body. I wanted to drown them. Choke them, everything! Hang them on the side of the school for all to see. The influence of Satan was causing these thoughts and got me depressed as well, so all the energy directed towards them eventually came to me. I held a blade to my throat once. I was going to puncture one of my lungs, let the air collapse my cavity, cut and carve messages on myself. Slit my throat and bleed out and leave my self in the middle of the home for my family. I hated life. Fuck it all. I was emotionally destroyed. To this day, I have no idea how I was able to put the knife down in spite of the tears. A song I heard by the band Orden Ogan, called Come With Me to the Otherside captures this memory to me. I heard it 6 years after the incident and it made me remember such a low memory that I cried at work. It hurt so much and helped me realize I needed help and reconciliation with my shitty childhood wasted and gone. Anyways. High school came around. I was shut off, emotionless, masturbated daily for 3 years up to that point. Needless to say, I made no friends or memories. I just floated with music in my ears and head down. I socialized here n there, but I didnt listen. It&#x27;s all blur. I successfully forgot my past and everything. Graduated not having friends or experience with women (talking, hanging out, dances, interacting). I lost weight early on and failed to realize my chances that girls liked me because I believe women did not like me. I got fat again when I started believing that a girl could like me senior year. Of course all interest dissapeared. I asked my parents again if I got fat. They said no. I knew I couldn&#x27;t take their word no longer. I&#x27;m sorry, I love y&#x27;all, but I dont trust y&#x27;alls word. Ugh.

In this time frame I had been to 10 to 20 different schools. Moved alot. We lost everything in 08. I&#x27;ll never forget what it feels like to be worried if I&#x27;ll have a simple tv dinner to eat each night. What it feels like if ill have a bed to sleep in each day. We lived out of a motel one christmas. Like a month or more. I hated this shit!!!! I never had the flashy &quot;toys&quot; that everyone had. I never fit in. Couple this with depression and noone wanting to be my friend, no girlfriend which I really wanted. Senior year would be my happiest year in all of school. I was honored to help the robotics group assemble their shit, like robots, schematics, sets, tracks, design their shit because they sucked at it. I wasn&#x27;t in robotics. My engineering teacher trusted me to help out because he &quot;believed in me&quot;. Thank you Enrique Elias. You for the first time in a long time in my life someone pushed me to do some things I never thought I could do. Lead. I earned respect because I was gifted in arts, music, and math. My art classes were fun and cool, too. My regret is that my mind told me lies and I believed it. In the end, high school was my time to bounce back, get involved, get fit, get a gf. My fault was isolating myself which kept me from my potential. I graduated. I threw away those memories. Kept the diploma. 2016 I graduated. My dad lost his job and we almost lost everything again. I learned also that there  was nothing saved for college that they always said they had. I was <mark>forced</mark> to put college off for two years and work full time to help my family financially. Now I&#x27;m in debt and stuck at home. Fuck this. Still no gf or social life or anything. Now my regrets eat me alive. I shook off depression before my senior year and it came back hard a year ago in 2018. Even as I got older. I asked my parents again one last time questions as to why what they always told me never came to pass. They still feed me bs. 

This isn&#x27;t everything, but I dont want rehash the past. I have no noteworthy memories that are good. I regret my entire life up to now. Some memories are best left buried. Hell my last job, my experience of emotional bullying made me numb enough to fail to realize I was being sexually harassed verbally and physically slapping my ass and pinch my nipples... BY MEN GODDAMMIT! They thought it was funny. I turned 21 and borderline became an alcoholic. Haha, I was still a virgin too. Hell, I&#x27;m not supposed to be here. I literally am a birthconrtol baby. I was not planned to be born. My parents both told people in front of me. They were both using protection. I am a miracle child! Why, O God?

I turned 22 in july of 2019. The same day I lost my virginity to a... i guess a hookup. I&#x27;m glad i got that off my back. I still suck with women, but i also realize one thing that it is kinda true that it takes the right women and people for things to work. Since august, i started confronting my mental issues. I can&#x27;t get help(I&#x27;m broke and insurance wont help out), so i researched. I bought me some good books and miraculously found Christ again. For the first time, I&#x27;m truly happy and gaining my confidence back. My prayers that I made as a child finally came true several years in the making. I haven&#x27;t had a meltdown a whole month this month! My most recent job I&#x27;m at is actually normal and my coworkers accept and revere my work with tires as a mechanic! I&#x27;m a smart and fast motherfucking worker! I&#x27;ve made friends last semester in college, I plan jam out with one and workout with another. My coworker Jacob, bless him, is one of those people I cannot explain that come into your life and push you. The right person. This dude has introduced Wes Watson&#x27;s self help to me(favorite quote from him is caring about what people think is a liability; caring about and for others is an asset), motivated me to work out since I&#x27;ve lost all the weight from high school 3 years ago. He helped me think. Kinda a role model. My other coworkers are cool, invited me to parties, get beers! These guys are older than me (30s). Kinda acting as role models for me, giving me advice. Some of the books I&#x27;ve read, I remember book say if something bad happens, it happened for a reason. What did you do to bring upon yourself? It put my life prospective. I never got help, I isolated myself, I gave up on god, I was doing something to outcast myself, I was too shy, I was all kinds of shit, which caused me to be bullied. I was an easy target. I also was never prepared for this shit cuz I was sheltered. I blame my family for that. In the end, I  the midst of all the bad shit, I&#x27;m good at engineering, I&#x27;m very artistic, I&#x27;m writing a book, I am the most badass guitarist! I&#x27;m good at games, which I play with coworkers on xbox, I&#x27;m financially intelligent because of recent hardships (now that things have sorted recently, I&#x27;m saving and paying off debt),  I got a high paying job for only 4 days of work a week, paying my way through college, 3.4 GPA, 60 credits, got my gym membership, got a me some good looking blazer suits, metal tshirts, Jean&#x27;s, MY style. Ditched my glasses awhile back, found a hair cut to work with my wavy hair, soon to get me Teeth Whitening( good stuff from a dentistry), I like fishing, I&#x27;m going to go out and live out things I&#x27;ve always wanted to do this year, I&#x27;m going to travel, I&#x27;m going to live my damn life. I&#x27;m starting over and never bringing the past up. I&#x27;m sorry future girlfriend and friends if it seems I never open up. I&#x27;m overcoming depression, negativity, satan. I got a long way to go. Next thing on my list though, is how to attract ladies, or at least get my awkward ass in gear. Nobody taught me, so now I must learn some how. My family assumed I&#x27;d figure shit out. They were wrong. They gave me tough love, but were being soft on me when shit needed to change. I own my truck, I have good credit, I moving out in six months! I&#x27;m transferring to UNT next fall. My happiest memories to date in my life have occurred from the past 3 years. They&#x27;re few and far between, including some of my senior year in high school. I&#x27;ll keep them to myself to take up space while give away the bad. 

If you made it this far, I wonder what your thoughts are. Side note, if you know resources that can help beat depression, help my social life, confidence, hell even with learning how attraction, dating, women, and whatnot works, recommend them please! I&#x27;ll take suggestions and wisdom, too.

            <div class="content collapsed">Throwaway as my friends know my other account.

I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve kept this a secret. I&#x27;m such an open book type of person. I want this to not just exist in my head though. 

When I was young, between 6-7, I had two older brothers (who shared a room) and an older sister (I&#x27;m a girl as well). My sister is 6 years older than me so we weren&#x27;t close until I was a teenager. So to me my only siblings were my brothers.

I loved my brothers. I trusted them. I looked up to them. I wanted to spend all my time with them. They were typical though, teasing me, roughhousing with me, etc. 

I had two brothers. One is my full brother (same parents) and the other is my half brother (same dad). My full brother, who we will call Jared, is only two years older than me. While my half brother, who we will call Michael, is four years older than me. Michael is the brother we will be focusing on.

As I said, I loved my brothers. So every night I would beg them to let me sleep in their room. Every few nights they would cave and I could sleep on a mattress on the floor. I would be on the floor, while Jared was on the bottom of a bunk bed, and Michael was on the top bunk. For the first half hour or so, we would all play together on our DSs. All whispering and being quiet as we were supposed to be asleep. Then Jared would get tired and we would all go to sleep. Usually.

I don&#x27;t know when it started but I know how. One night as I was trying to sleep, I heard Michael make a &quot;psst&quot; noise. I rolled over and looked up to him. He asked me if I wanted to see something. He&#x27;s my older &quot;cooler&quot; brother, so of course I said yes. He had me climb up the bunk bed to him and told me to be quiet. When I got up there, he had his dick out. That&#x27;s how it started.

Following that night, every time I slept in their room, me and him would wait until Jared fell asleep so we could continue our &quot;game&quot;. 

Since Jared couldn&#x27;t see Michael from his bed, sometimes before Jared fell asleep Michael would flash me as a sort of tease.

It started with me just looking. Then it was me watching him masturbate. Then it was me touching which progressed to me giving him handjobs. Eventually it progressed to me showing him parts of myself and letting him touch me. Sort of a give and receive type of thing, I could see one thing if I showed him something. It escalated further by him asking me if I wanted to taste. After that, I was <mark>blow</mark>ing him while he stroked me. Only once do I remember it going so far that he actually vaginally penetrated me. Although to be fair, that memory is very repressed so I&#x27;m not sure if it was a dream or not. 

This went on for a few months. The entire time I thought it wasn&#x27;t bad, just our secret. He convinced me it was fun and, sadly, I was eager to do it. I never was uncomfortable, he eased me into it. I always consented. 

Then one birthday, I was gifted a camera. I loved the camera. I took pictures of everything. One night when I was supposed to stay the night in their room, I asked him if I could take a picture of it. I wanted a way to look at it whenever I wanted. I guess I was curious at the time. The way he reacted weirded me out. He got very serious and told me no. I asked why. He said because I transfer the pictures to the family computer and my parents could see. I tried to convince him I would hide it but he refused. I went back to my room and thought about it. Up until then, I thought we only hid it from our parents because we were supposed to be asleep at those times and I was scared of getting in trouble for staying up late. I didn&#x27;t know it was bad and he told me it was normal.

That night when Jared went to sleep and Michael did his usual &quot;psst&quot;, I didn&#x27;t roll over. I pretended to be asleep until he stopped. I was confused and suddenly it all felt wrong. 

As far as I know, he did try a few more times after that but it never went far. Eventually, he stopped. I forgot about it and repressed the memory for years. It wasn&#x27;t until I was 13 and rape was becoming more and more publicly recognized that I started thinking. It took a while but eventually something reminded me of it and it all came flooding back. I had repressed these memories for years and suddenly I knew what they meant. Still, I kept my mouth shut.

Here I am years later. Michael is all grown up. He&#x27;s moved out, lives in a house, has a fiancée and is considering having kids. He has another younger sister but she is much younger than me so I believe I am his only &quot;victim&quot;. I don&#x27;t really know another word for it other than &quot;victim&quot;.  Other than influencing a lot of my sexual fetishes and roleplays (typically I like being in a vulnerable, submissive position, I prefer to give oral and never receive it (as was done with Michael) and I look at more taboo relationships (not incest but inappropriate relationships like people I hate, my boss, etc. but I do watch a lot of incest porn, typically where the brother blackmails or forces the sister, and I do have a rape fetish. Not sure if this is influenced by Michael but possibly), I have no negative affects of it. I don&#x27;t think it had any mental tolls. Mine and his relationship was never close and is still strained a bit but not to a noticeable point. I feel weird around him now because for the longest time I forgot about this as I was only 6-7 at the time but I wonder if he remembers it considering he was 10-11 at the time. 

I&#x27;ll never tell. I don&#x27;t want to ruin his life. And since I see no effects on me from it, I don&#x27;t see why he should be punished. He was young and a kid like me. I believe I was his only &quot;victim&quot; and I believe he grew out of it. I just think he was a curious young boy who just wanted to experiment. I think he grew out of it so I don&#x27;t fear for the safety of other girls. I don&#x27;t want to tear our family apart for nothing and I don&#x27;t want to ruin his life. Which is why no one, and I mean no one, knows this. This is my first time saying it, even anonymously. I guess I just don&#x27;t want this to be only in my head.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Sit down, children, and you shall hear the most awkward story of Paul Revere.

So, here I am with my best friend in my freshman year of high school, &quot;Karen.&quot;

Our school had two sets of stairs near the left side of the campus, one set coming down from the main gym, the second coming off of a small exit right next to the gym.

We would sit on the second set of stairs, because it has the best view of the campus&#x27;s relatively forested inner landscape.

It was rather beautiful, but we didn&#x27;t keep it for long.

The next week, a sophomore couple making out took our spot. We were slightly annoyed and yelled &quot;get a room!&quot; jokingly.

The girl, &quot;Julia&quot;, and the guy, &quot;David&quot;, both turned to us. Julia had a permanent snooty look on her face, and accordingly sneered at us. David gave us a blank, yet focused look.

He was very handsome, though. He was a dirty blonde rugby jock who I had seen a lot around. Deep, piercing blue eyes, the cutest freckles, slightly pointed canines like a sexy wolverine, with a perfect swimmer&#x27;s build.

Sweat-inducing description aside, the next day, they weren&#x27;t there and we took the spot again. They came back later in the period and saw us; David rose his eyebrows slightly and walked on, while Julia gave her characteristic sneer and then narrowed her eyes at us.

The next day, they took the larger steps coming out of the main gym for lunch. We had our spot back, so we stopped thinking about David and Julia.

Freshman year passed.

As eighth-graders, Karen and I had taken French I online, so we were able to be in French II during 9th grade, and now French III during 10th grade.

Now, since everyone \*had\* to take 2 years of a language to graduate, French I and French II were artificially packed with about 30+ people, but French III was 10–25, and AP French famously had about 5 students.

Our teacher, Madame, now that we had more room for everyone, liked mixing us around regularly.

That&#x27;s when I saw David again—-with a black eye.

This is odd, but I didn&#x27;t think black eyes were \*actually\* something that happened. I thought that they were primarily a visual technique used in popular media to emphasize eye injuries and abrasions. He didn&#x27;t try to hide it.

Anyway, he was rather quiet and was moved from a table of attractive rugby players to a table of four, with a nice goth girl named Angeline, Karen, myself, and David. Mme preferred equal gender division, hence two boys and two girls.

We started chatting casually. I assumed he would be some blockhead jock, but after some initial awkwardness about his black eye, wherein he explained he ran into an opposing player during some sort of drill, we started talking about the book he was reading. It was some Chomsky tome critiquing American hegemony, and we talked about American geopolitical history for the rest of the period.

Karen, David, and I quickly became friends, but it was obviously that they were becoming a \*bit\* closer.

I was very jealous, but I, for one, wasn&#x27;t out and wasn&#x27;t going to entrust some boy I didn&#x27;t know very well with my secret, and two, I initially didn&#x27;t want to be a homebreaker.

You might ask why Karen, and I later, didn&#x27;t mind flirting with a committed guy?

Well, here&#x27;s the detour:

Back in their early sophomore year, Julia and David began dating; like many petty high school relationships, it was primarily based on sex. The usual

Personality-wise, David found in Julia a sort of wallflower quirkiness with her own fire. Julia found a submissive, cute jock that she could dominate.

Given more attention, as they matured together, Julia came out of her shell to emerge as a guilt-inducing emotional dictator.

Try as he might, David quickly became emotionally drained from her and subsequently ran out of care for her. However, she wouldn&#x27;t let go, using all of her manipulative powers to hold him by his balls.

So...he cheated on her. He cheated with two girls he was relatively close to, some rugby guys, and had a few miscellaneous hookups.

You&#x27;d think that Julia would be at least a \*little\* angry and embarrassed as the rumor mill started churning, but, in fact, her best friend, Samantha, had started aggressively hitting on her. Julia wasn&#x27;t bi, but she craved emotional attention since David started glazing over after she showed her true colors.

Julia, having her emotional energy drained by Sam, could only sustain her husk of a relationship with David through guilt and sex.

The decreasing marginal returns for her led to David cutting her off during the beginning of his junior year, when he started dating Katie, an artistic hippie who mirrored his own charisma in a uniquely feminine way.

At any rate, Karen and David started moving closer. She started showing me their budding flirtatious text conversations, and I resolved myself to squash my jealousy and be a good friend and wingman.

There were some problems that they had, though. David had quite a few mental problems that he and I have only fully understood in the last few months. He had borderline personality disorder from parental neglect(he was a stoner who used weed, sex, and Nietzschean existentialism to escape his emotional abandonment-engulfment cycles, as well as significant erraticism.) and complex-PTSD from being sexually abused multiple times by one of his mom&#x27;s boyfriends during childhood. And so, David wanted-no, needed a benevolent/playful dom to be his partner to satisfy what he and i call his &quot;Oedipenis.&quot; A semi-absent mother figure led him to crave an unconditionally loving dominant partner.

Yet, due to his fear of being emotionally overwhelmed/engulfed, he made the mistake of choosing quiet wallflowers, who seemed passionate and benevolently dominant, but were secretly abrasive without sufficient social power. He does this a lot. With his friends, from insecure passive-aggressive nerds to frequently socially ignored guitarists to lanky stoners who are slowly figuring out that downing more protein shakes won&#x27;t fix their low self-esteem to girls with severe daddy issues to extroverted pragmatists who are slowly figuring out that living out the sexual dysfunction &quot;Shameless&quot; won&#x27;t bring them love, he acts as the mediator, because he subconsciously believes that if he can care for everybody else unconditionally, they will care for him back and not hurt, abandon, or engulf him. Yet, see my TL;DR. He has the same problem that I do. We are both stuck in everlasting struggles. He has aired out his social stress multiple times to me.

\*sigh\*

Now, I was really good friends with Karen, but she was too defensive and reliant on others&#x27; dominant initiative in a romantic/sexual relationship. Such different starting places, he a neglected stoner who suddenly found the nectar of sex to fix his low self-esteem once puberty and protein powder got through with him, and she a smothered upper-class scene girl, but both seeking the same kind of person...\*SIGH\*. Obviously deeply incompatible, but I was sublimating my feelings for David vicariously through Karen, so I put on my Machiavellian thinking cap and put in a little elbow grease.

This is the immoral tidbit.

I decided to help David &quot;develop initiative&quot; and help Karen &quot;be more benevolently dominant&quot; by sending each other specific screenshots of my conversations with them. I would get David texts that showed that Karen would immediately respond as soon as he emotionally affirmed her a \*little more.\* I would show Karen that based on his increased affirmation, he wanted her to respond a bit more &quot;benevolently dominant.&quot; They both took the catnip, and they vastly progressed in their relationship, so much so that their &quot;love&quot; was able to gloss over the fundamental incompatibility. Now, I knew this situation was inherently unsustainable, but I wanted them to get closure with each other first.

Eventually, Karen found some screenshots of her texts on my phone(ask people to not swipe if you show them something on your camera roll!) and ratted me out to David. They froze me out, but I still talked to them on an acquaintance basis few and far between.

Without my stabilizing and catalyzing influence, their romantic/sexual relationship slowly iced over. They didn&#x27;t really remain friends, but relapsed into civil acquaintances.

I decided that I was acting immaturely by staying quiet, so I reached out to them separately, and slowly rebuilt my friendship with both of them, even as they solidly remained icy for a long time.

This was at the end of David&#x27;s senior year, and after a year and junior prom with Katie, he ended up dating Julia again for his last year, and, with limited time to fix anything, they utterly fell apart aside from random bouts of sex. They both left for different states.

That was May 2017, and that fall, I started my senior year. Iced away still from Karen and David, I was relatively quiet on both fronts.

The second semester started, and during the first week of January 2018, David sent out multiple texts from a new number saying that he had changed his number. Every since that Chomsky conversation, we have both had jokingly political conversation, him being an anarcho-syndicalist, but we joke about him being a primitivist hermit, and me always being a committed communist. We talked about Nietzsche&#x27;s pithy statement about how one&#x27;s biography determines their life philosophy, and how his free-spirited nature led to his more left-libertarian stance, and my own stiff immigrant upbringing led to my own strict communism. This led into speaking about weed, which weirdly ended up one February night in us talking about our sexual exploits.

I was still scared to out myself to him, but we happened to chance upon his gay rugby exploits in our conversation, which I hadn&#x27;t known about beforehand.

I weighed the odds, and I decided that there was a negligible chance that he&#x27;d reveal my secret if I just told him, so I decided to just be open.

It worked out, gladly. He was happy that I was open with him, and we swapped our &quot;conquest&quot; stories. We continued talking about anything and everything, from the intersection of modernism with Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem to masturbating to each other in the past to politics to tech and our childhoods and our personal psychoanalyses. We talked for hours every day over text and frequently called for hours in the evening. I know, I know, the soothing effect of some odd actualization of my long-repressed crush was probably subsidizing problems I couldn&#x27;t see that I was rushing hundreds of miles per hour into an open maw.

From Feb-May, the romantic ante was constantly upped, and we started having skirmishes about where we were going emotionally. Initially, he&#x27;d be hesitant, considering how hurt he was by Rachel, but he&#x27;d still brazenly flirt with me. He talked about not trusting me yet, and then oscillating again into saying he did have feelings for me. By mid-May, he said he was coming back to my city to visit family during the second week of June. He grew readily more confident, and amidst completely unrelated conversation during one of our night calls, he said he had definite romantic feelings for me and he wanted to plan a &quot;friendly outing&quot; when he got back.

This made me internally giddy, but, ever the stoic rationalist, I responded with a moderate and not overwhelming amount of joy.

It was confusing, but asking him in a forthright manner led to him saying he was generally just confused about the nature of his feelings due to his failed relationships, but he did want to start to engage and flirt with me, which I had been doing all along.

I&#x27;ve asked him how he knew his feelings were legitimate. He cheated on so many people. Why wouldn&#x27;t he cheat on me if we did grow closer?

He replied by saying that even without physicality, I had been there for him intellectually and emotionally.(This was sort of obvious, seeing as he only initiates with broken people as a therapist, but our organic situation had no D/S dynamic.) &quot;I&#x27;ve never been present during sex with women, and other guys are usually callous, closeted, or cold.&quot; Months of interpersonal analysis led to us figuring out that he was just gay, and the women always fulfilled some need. Now, I know the skeptic&#x27;s soapbox well, and I know it seems like I might be so inundated with my puppy love that I was at his mental hand and foot that he was just enjoying the level of control he had over me, but, again, I am ever the stoic rationalist. I have, I do, and I will enthusiastically criticize and discuss anything with anyone, and my passion ends where irrationality starts. We have definitely dipped and risen many times.

Sappy bullshit aside, I think he just wanted an equal. Hedonism with his newfound desirability was all fine and dandy, but that didn&#x27;t cover up the parental neglect or abuse. The only sustainable way to have perpetual and self-contained happiness is family values. Obviously not the homophobic, regressive brand of &quot;family values&quot; we all know and love, but the sense of community, loyalty, and altruism that usually exists in a nuclear family, but can just as easily be created within a band of lifelong friends or a polyamorous BDSM commune. A family is composed of self-supporting and inter-supporting equals having unconditional love for one another, and David has been screwed over by, well, everyone.

It&#x27;s odd, but I think that I am the first person who has ever actually expected some degree of mutual respect from him.

Among most people, he was this charismatic rugby jock with a brilliant mind and a gleaming smile, a big man on campus who must be venerated, to his friends, in many ways, he was their emotional leader and idol, and in the context of his divorced parents, he was an insignificant kid who they didn&#x27;t consider when breaking up.

But seeing him as a person and insisting that he see me as a person as well...it may very well be the first relationship he had ever been in that was between equals. Borderline people usually display a deep lack of self-awareness, but I think I <mark>forced</mark> him to consider the moral responsibility of being a functional emotional adult.

I chose to believe that, since I am deeply compatible with him in almost every way, from sharing interests on anthropology, philosophy, blacksmithing, physical activity, relationships, a variety of miscellaneous hobbies, and more. We always organically meeting in the middle, and, as you can tell by now, I&#x27;m certainly long-winded enough and perhaps substantive enough to talk about everything.

However, we still had regular issues, primarily about trust and fear of the other, but a night of cathartic conversation resolved everything every time.

June came, and with the sweltering heat came the increasing heat in both of our nether regions. Sexting grew more frequent.

Then the day came. I removed any blackheads, double-showered, and then I saw him for the first time for over a year. We went walking in our local park, and a general mix of low-tier apprehension and joy dominated(retroactively confirming) both our minds. We got to a tiny grotto next to a bridge, and I remembered how serene the bridge was during a past phone call with him. Overcome with emotion, I went in and kissed him.

It was pretty intense for me, and he was obviously aroused, as he went in for tongue, which was a first for me, but i attempted to match his moves. He must be very experienced, I thought. My schizoid traits make me overly analytical, though, as I kept my eyes open. We then continued walking until he grabbed my shoulder and asked me to follow him; we ended up in this meadow blocked from the path&#x27;s view, and mild oral and vigorous making out ensued. After that, we went back to his car, and he started telling me about a once-off fling with an old friend(female) and having parallel-romantic feelings for her. That made me feel bad, but I didn&#x27;t want to ruin the tenor of the date.

The day ended, and when I got home, I sent him a few romantic texts, and when he didn&#x27;t respond that night(he went out to reconnect with some friends; I&#x27;m not trying to be a jailer, as how I feel is not his responsibility.), I remembered the fling he talked about, and how he used to have a harem of cheerleader girls, and now seemed like he was trying to subconsciously groom me to be part of some hyper-manipulative neo-harem now that he was trying out his gay side, and I remembered how he blocked me out for months when I tried to be honest with him and Karen. He just never seemed to respect me, and no matter how direct I was, he would never truly be himself, as happy as he was.

So, I just stopped talking to him. I got into a rut of overworking and engaging more in my hobbies to just get away from him. And then the switches flipped, as he&#x27;d text me, e-mail me, and call me incessantly about how much he wanted me in his life and how much he wanted to talk to me, if only briefly.

A month later, I accidentally butt-texted him, and he jumped on the text immediately. I&#x27;m obsessed with logical consistency(daddy issues; my parents wouldn&#x27;t care about my input or respect my agency where it was important and where my siblings got respect, so I believed if I only spoke in terms of logical order, they couldn&#x27;t invalidate my words, because the onus would be on the validity of my facts and not on how high they valued my opinion), and so I sought to apologize for the accident. He may have misconstrued my words as me being ready to speak on romantic terms again, but I remained icy for a few days, but he has this way of making me feel grounded and happy, so within the next few days, I semi-formally asked him to be my boyfriend.

He agreed with his usual easy mirth, and the rest of July was identical to our prior romantic months, but he would engage more by proactively sending me fun memes and strong insights every morning.

I sublimated my jealousy into productive curiosity, and we learned more about each other, that he had borderline adaptations and I had schizoid adaptations, and that he had been sexually abused by one of his mom&#x27;s string of boyfriends in eighth grade, and, as such, he was co-morbid with complex PTSD as well.

Everything seemed to be getting worse and better at the same time, but it all came to a head last August, wherein it was just more work for him, but I started college, and he completely did a 180 and said he wanted to just be friends, and he just retreated into his shell and more or less rejected me, not responding to anything, and when I got stressed out and asked for an explanation, he blocked me. I sent an e-mail just to confirm the block(it was at night) wasn&#x27;t just a glitch and to let out all my feelings, and he shortly unblocked me, going back and forth on blocking about nine times from August to October, wherein I became progressively more depressed, and he oscillated between hurtfully comparing me to his caustic ex and then growing softer whilst reminiscing about our good times. A little before my birthday in late October hit, he released his pressure and apologized for his past three months of behavior, attributing his behavior to intense paranoia related to Julia and a feeling of replicative abuse of his neglectful and divorced parents, as well as his rapist.

Shortly after this, I got into a car crash and received a concussion. I spiraled when I read a Reddit post on this subreddit that I thought was him, and I told him my fear about his old friend and his trust issues and our collective neuroses in general. He got into his tribal mediator mode and said that he had confirmed he was gay, and that the dissociating sex with women was a borderline defense mechanism to try to attain attention from a strong female, i.e. mommy issues. There was a lot of talking about how nuanced and caring I was and how he cherished my mental intensity even in the emotional moments when his exes or friends would have disparaged or ignored him.

It did console me, and November and December were perfect in their romantic feeling. As Winter Break pulled closer and David was planning a holiday visit, we planned to get a hotel room for a night.

A week before our meeting, he told me about feeling nauseated every few months when he thought about how he hurt the girls in his past harem, and I pushed him to resolve his issues with Julia by unblocking her and directly texting her. He did, promptly came out to her, told her who he was dating, and they made a date to see each other. He was fantastically happy to finally get closure, and she only reacted positively, but the next morning, there was a twist.

He told me about having recurrent sexual feelings for her and then how he wanted to maintain an open relationship. I have nothing against poly people, but...not for me.

I just said that if he is obligate poly(as opposed to facultative), then we could just be friends. He became panicky and scared, and then he internalized the shame and stopped talking to me. I then called him; he said he prioritized me and wanted monogamy, and we came to a consensus of polyamory being his mode of weakening intimacy, so he wouldn&#x27;t feel emotionally engulfed, i.e. borderline defense mechanism. This seemed tenable for the time being, but then we met up on January 1st. Part of the whole submission-to-women complex used to involve oscillating with trans feelings and crossdressing desires. Julia used to dress him up in her skirts, panties, and/or lingerie whilst she would use a strapon on him. Part of the date was going to be going to this lingerie shop downtown, subsequently buying some books and getting coffee. My little kinky existentialist(too bad I&#x27;m a thorough modernist), lol.

Yet, I suddenly stopped getting text responses the morning of. I called him multiple times, received no response, and with a curious dismissal, I slowly paled into the realization that he got cold feet. Ha! My hedonistic womanizer, nervous of me, some random short guy, and not his aggressively dominant exes and ruthless friends?

Maybe he didn&#x27;t want me anymore. Who ignores someone when they&#x27;re frantic for months(after the Karen crisis) or after uninterrupted bliss(last July)? I knew there had to be some catch to getting the perfect guy. I mean, who gets their straight hunky crush to fall in love with them, have deeply engaging conversation with them on all levels without end in sight, come out with them, and go through so much simultaneous growth? That&#x27;s every young gay guy&#x27;s erstwhile dream.

Who was I, a try-hard nerdy guy, to get such a perfect partner right at the exact cusp of my budding adulthood? I am not unconfident, but, seriously, this scenario was almost textbook perfect. Even the current emotional turmoil...most likely, it will be solved by his seeing my honest and caring face most days. A growth arc for us both...argghhh! All the perfect ingredients, but what if I&#x27;ve destroyed everything forever? What if I came on too strong and he knows I want him to be my boyfriend and now he&#x27;s just too scared of disappointing me? Our senses of shame seem to throttle each other. He doesn&#x27;t want to disappoint anyone, so he just leaves(abandoned children can always escape); I don&#x27;t want to disappoint anyone, so I just create a logical paradigm to understand, if not control, everything(youngest child has no escape, but all the expectations and legacies, so the only answer is to always be better than yourself).

Why can&#x27;t he just understand that I love him without conditions? I wish he could understand that he makes me smile and explode with mirth, even now, whilst rereading his old texts. As an intensely private person, it was an accomplishment when he proactively sent me a nude whilst we were sexting late at night, which was the first time he&#x27;d ever taken one, aside from the one begrudgingly extracted from him from Julia.

Anyhow, he finally called me back at 2pm, and said he was unsure he could be in a relationship, explicating with commitment and trust issues fundamentally rooted in the insecurities of the problems of the prior week. I mentioned those prior issues, telling him how I felt about them(that I believed monoamory and monogamy were separate, and when we were relatively settled without dynamic drama, we seemed to be fully content with each other, and that I was there for him, whatever decision he decided to make), and then he felt emboldened enough to drive up to my college campus, wherein we just walked around, had cathartic conversation about the same issues, but with a greater measure of credibility levied to me, due to him seeing my face and hearing me directly.

The clincher for him, before he looked at me directly, eyes softening and narrowing, grabbed my shoulders, and started violently making out with me, was a little bit of object relations theory. He mentioned frequently about even when we were not speaking, he thought so much about me constantly, and even when he was angry at me, it was about how stressful my mental ubiquity seemed to be. I mentioned the part-object, that he could easily dissociate from sex with his &quot;girlfriends&quot;, his summer fling with his old friend included, or see hookups with other guys as purely visceral action, friends included, which fundamentally gave every person a mental time limit. We were infinitely perpetuating, because our puzzle pieces of minds regenerated enthusiasm at every instance, and my so-called womanizer denied sex with me when he thought I was disappointed in his &quot;polyamorous desires&quot;, i.e. when he thought i was disappointed in him. It was never about a part of me, whether it was my firebrand philosophizing, immigrant quirks, or my intellectual and emotional honesty, or my annoying anxiety, for that matter. He would bring up Jungian type theory, and whenever I&#x27;d describe my experiences, he&#x27;d talk about a compatible type, and over time, he broke multiple orthodox models by sending me articles and memes and walls of texts and information over calls to justify being an INFP, not the type I&#x27;m theoretically most compatible with, but the type closest in compatibility to my spoken experiences. Quite the whole-object relation.

That night was perfect. We grew horny enough to end up <mark>blow</mark>ing each other, then realized the time, and he drove me home, but parked on the street over from mine, turning off his lights, landing us in the pitch black darkness. I could glimpse his nervous and rare smile gleaming in the briefest moment of moonlight, and he proceeded to leap over the gear shift over my lap, and before I knew it, the blissfully warm electricity of his lips touched me again and we made out again. Finally, he drove me over to my street, but one house before it. Blah, blah, blah, we made out a bit again and I left, for him to go off to a night party with his friends.

The next day, we went to a cheesy hotel downtown at 4 in the afternoon. We took a Lyft, because his car was in the shop, and I remember exchanging a smirk with David as our driver made a semi-serious joke about a local sorority staying at the hotel as well that night.

Anyhow, we checked in, started talking, got naked, and started making out. I was going to go down on him, but he had the pubes of a wildebeest and I asked him if I could trim them. He let me, and when it got to a certain level, I asked to shave the rest. He got antsy about that, so I gave up on it, and we walked back to the bed from the bathroom, wherein I almost tackled him to the ground playfully. He didn&#x27;t want to, went back to bed, and gave me the whole &quot;confusion&quot; spiel, I started asking questions, we dissected the situation, and he jumped on me again. However, when I got out the sex toys we agreed we might use, he got antsy again. I took this as a sign to go slower, but even just making out and talking for an hour and a half made him feel antsy about prior events.

The night was lost to my schizoid paranoia and his borderline shame.

From 4pm to 4am, we just talked constantly and went back and forth. I retroactively take our ability to discuss productively even these intensely messy situations as a sign of possible long-term relationship. We both ended up masturbating to go to bed, and ever the aggressive one, I sucked him off a bit and swallowed his cum, in memory of a fantasy he elaborated upon the previous November 16that 11:53pm my time, 12:53am his time. I partially didn&#x27;t want to see if he&#x27;d emotionally oscillate too much if I stuck my dick in his mouth(mind you, he had asked me to fuck him about eight times that night already), so I ended up just masturbating by myself, but, in the dark, I accidentally ended up jizzing all over his abdomen, and I&#x27;m sure he spiraled a bit as he got up and went to clean himself in the shower(we had both edged for ten days beforehand, hence a very large buildup of cum and invariably constantly high libido, and that&#x27;s considering we are both boys in our late teens.). I swiftly fell asleep on my side of the bed, but, in the middle of the night, whether it was accidental or not, I felt him hugging me a little bit briefly(I&#x27;m a very light sleeper.). I sighed, realized all would be well, and fell into a deeper sleep.

I woke up early, organized all our things, took a shower, brushed my teeth, and waited on my phone as he went through his motions.

He looked despondently out the window as he got dressed, and I playfully made an analogy about the origins and mechanism of bleak existentialism as opposed to my modernism, and this encouraged him enough to kiss me, but he then moved his face away in pain. Clearly, he had internalized his shame again and I was now months away from an answer.

As we rode back in the Lyft, I typed out a message essentially saying &quot;Before you leave the cab, blink at me if you know me, if you know us and our love. Our trust, our resilience, our nuance, and our solidarity against a bleak universe of sorrow we are both feeling right now.&quot;, as we couldn&#x27;t exactly spell out romantic drama in front of some random driver, much less gay drama.

He did blink, but that was all I heard from him for a week and a half. For the next semester, every month, we&#x27;d speak for a few days, he&#x27;d want to get back together, but then I&#x27;d ask too many questions, he&#x27;d absorb my curiosity as fatherly aggressive disappointment, internalize the shame, and then retreat for another month.

I initially came out to him thinking I would never see him again, and then it grew into more. We had fantasies of going to close professional schools together eventually. I&#x27;m pre-med and he&#x27;s either going to go into Bio/Anthro with a later clinical psych PhD or Special Forces if his low self-esteem drives him to further &quot;Self-transcendent&quot; behavior. Think Cloninger. He&#x27;s a nerd at heart who uses Nietzschean tactics to get into jock circles. Oddly brilliant.

However, I convinced him last November to move back to our home city, he managed a full ride, and now he will be back permanently in early June. He&#x27;s now visiting his mother in these last two weeks before his return. I hope it will be cathartic, as the essential role of the neglectful mother is the core of his borderline personality disorder, his &quot;Oedipenis&quot;. (It&#x27;s always so odd how he&#x27;s so much gayer(his female &quot;desire&quot; doesn&#x27;t really exist outside of his neurotic episodes. An easy high due to feeling desirable without feeling overwhelmed, because he doesn&#x27;t really like girls. Think about how most gay guys find it odd that straight guys are uncomfortable asking out girls, and how said gays would find it easy to date girls just to hang out, but then add in David&#x27;s neurotic/borderline &quot;self-transcendent&quot; behavior, which amplifies such platonic experience into sexual validation. The need for validation is the solution to his disorder, but my logical nature presupposes that if I talk to you at all, I necessarily respect you and consider your words of value. Would you actively encourage anyone in a normal situation? If you don&#x27;t make a big fuss out of small achievements, and even be completely nonchalant about huge ones, then it&#x27;s as if you have an immense level of respect for said person&#x27;s competence. I wouldn&#x27;t congratulate a 40-year-old mathematician for acing a middle school geometry test. I fundamentally consider most compliments outside of almost objectively huge accomplishments to be patronizing. I don&#x27;t care how brilliant you are, a Nobel Prize or Fields Medal deserves massive congratulations, obviously.) when he&#x27;s mentally settled.)

Maybe he will return. He is always the proactive one for large comebacks.

I just wish he could understand how I felt about him.

But I won&#x27;t hold my breath. I&#x27;m glad he won&#x27;t see this. I&#x27;ll keep a stiff upper lip and just be calmer and take everything in my stride when he comes back.

I just hope he ever talks to me again. I feel so empty and sad all the time, no matter what I do, whether it&#x27;s work or reading or playing around or hanging out with other friends.

This probably record-long Reddit post is over, guys. What do you think?

TL;DR: I&#x27;m scared of what I term &quot;aggressive&quot; people, which conditions me to tending towards meek people who never take the initiative to support me when I need it, I then grow bored of their non-action, blame it on myself, then I leave, and I have recycled the same process for my entire life. When my family construct was particularly falling apart due to my siblings growing up and my parents getting on in age, I fell into a meaningless limbo, and this oh so perfectly intersected with my first crush, who happened to be a meek and moderately mentally ill dreamboat who pushed all my pain and pleasure buttons at once. I am currently trying to piece it all together. Care to comment? I would heartily appreciate it. I have no experience with borderline personality disorder, and I don&#x27;t know what to do or even how to feel about his actions. I don&#x27;t want to be pathetic, but...what&#x27;s the best possible future, Reddit?</div>

**TW: emotional and physical abuse.**

I&#x27;m a 22 year old female, seeking therapy and treatment as of tomorrow; I have been struggling with symptoms of anxiety and depression since very early adolescence. I suspect I may also be Aspergic - a doctor has suggested this before, after I came to him last year believing I had the traits of borderline personality disorder. After doing some personal research, I do appear to have a lot of the characteristics of high functioning autism. The mostly BPD symptoms lessened over time. I&#x27;m not sure how relevant or helpful this information is, but I thought it was perhaps worth mentioning, in case I&#x27;m <mark>blow</mark>ing things out of proportion.  As a disclaimer, I accept there is a chance that, given this is told from my perspective, I could be biased. I also accept that my mother is likely to also be mentally ill, and is an imperfect human being just like all of us.

When I was younger, and sometimes even now, my mother seemed very unhappy and seemed to have it in for me. She has mentioned before that she was like this due to &#x27;money problems&#x27;. In my eyes, she favoured my younger sister, who was a lot more sociable than me. My dad wasn&#x27;t and still isn&#x27;t around very often, as he is a truck driver and works all week, though I suspect he wouldn&#x27;t have cared anyway - what he did know about he didn&#x27;t really do anything about and would often agree with her or defend her. My sister doesn&#x27;t seem to remember a lot of what happened, but I have confided in her recently. I am relieved to say that both she and my boyfriend (of 3 years) believe me.

My mother seemed <mark>blow</mark> up very intensely - the anger directed primarily towards me - at least once a month, or more often than that. I understand that naturally, all parents are human, and of course they get angry. I want to try and view my mother as humanly as possible. But I feel some of the ways in which she treated me went way overboard.

I will not try and pretend that I was some angelic, perfect teenager - but I was not a monster child. Yes, my room would be untidy sometimes. Yes, I would sometimes be emotional and moody, forget to put deodorant on, and do pretty stupid things. But I never tried to be incredibly malicious or deliberately non-compliant. Actually, I did once say to a boyfriend that I hated her, and she overheard, but given the context (as you&#x27;ll see), at the time I felt justified in saying it. So, I could be a little shit sometimes. I will hold up my hands and admit that I must have hurt her feelings sometimes. But I was honestly frightened of her, spending my nights upstairs on the computer just to avoid her. I didn&#x27;t beat up old ladies, or steal, or do drugs (sometimes I drank, but weirdly, my mother was okay with this, as she&#x27;d done it as a teenager too).  I have honestly tried repeatedly to wrack my brains and analyse my past self over and over to see if I did anything totally out of order, because in her eyes, I must have. I think maybe it&#x27;s because I unknowingly struggled socially, and with a lack of awareness, that made her angry.

**(The Specifics)**

I remember the first few events happening when I was around six, continuing until I was 19.  I came home from school one day, I was in second grade. I&#x27;d had a Spanish class and we&#x27;d had some competition, my team had lost. I was telling her about my day and had jokingly said, like the dumb six year old I was, salty at losing, that the other team were totally cheaters (it escapes me whether they&#x27;d actually cheated or not). She absolutely lost her fucking mind, you guys. She slapped me HARD, multiple times, with all the force she could and screamed at the top of her lungs in my face, her spit was peppering me. I can&#x27;t really remember what she was saying but it was terrifyingly loud and it went on for a good ten minutes. She sent me upstairs and shoved me in my room. I was in absolute shock, shaking, tears and shot streaming down my face. Even now I don&#x27;t really understand what came over her, but it has stayed with me til this day, amongst all the other events:

She once threatened to beat me up (she told me I was very lucky she didn&#x27;t), sometimes she did hit me. She once pushed me hard into a wardrobe. She&#x27;d scream in my face for hours until I was hyperventilating and choking on my tears. She&#x27;d shout at me for comfort eating, and then would tell me that I was putting on weight. This made my self-esteem very low... she seemed to dislike her own appearance. She would frequently compare me to other girls, making barbed comments about how the other students at her hairdressing course were far more sociable and talkative than me, and acted more like her daughters. She would shout at me often, waking me suddenly at 6am if the cat had pooped in my room, saying that it was my fault (the bedroom door was open). She would mock my make-up and tell me I was dressing wrong. She would get angry when I wouldn&#x27;t want to tell her the intimate details of my relationships. She would insist on squeezing my blackheads and zits on me, forcing me to lie down on the sofa and pinch my face painfully, and would tell me to stop making a fuss even though I was crying and clearly in pain. &#x27;God, your face is ERUPTING. You don&#x27;t want to look like a hairy monster now that boys are hanging around&#x27;, she said. Thus, the same applied to plucking my eyebrows, and cutting my hair. She would tug very hard and force my head down sharply - her hairdressing teacher even told her off for this once. I would have difficulty following vague spoken instructions sometimes (I still do sometimes) and she&#x27;d get very angry with me, telling me that she babied me too much, as if I was being deliberately obtuse. She would humiliate me, phoning my auntie, her regular confidante, loudly telling her all the terrible things I&#x27;d done. She would give me the silent treatment. She once even confiscated my phone and messaged my friends to tell her that I had done horrible things to her. It was very embarrassing.

She and father allowed my grandfather to live with us abroad for a while, even though he is on the sex offenders register. Nothing happened to me or my sister to my knowledge, but he did molest my cousins.

She has called me a whore before, when I was starting to get sexually active. She made me feel ashamed in relation to sexually related stuff a few times. She locked me in the car after dropping my sister off and yelled at me for being selfish and not caring about my sister enough, and wouldn&#x27;t let me leave until I stopped crying, otherwise she wouldn&#x27;t let me go to school. I assume this was because she didn&#x27;t want to teachers to see (this happened on a few occasions). If I said anything about our life, even if it wasn&#x27;t to do with this, she&#x27;d snap about not letting people know our business. She would make me feel guilty often for all the &#x27;bad&#x27; things I did.  My auntie (her sister) seemed to be a big influence on her. I&#x27;m sure my auntie is a narc. I remember when my first boyfriend broke up with me (I was young and emotionally needy, and he cheated). Obviously, I was heartbroken. I threw myself on the ground and wailed out in absolutely agony, after my mother had left the house. She had shouted at him down the phone. At least she had somewhat defended me, I guess. (Though I personally think she still shouldn&#x27;t have got involved). I became depressed for months, in my naive little head, I thought this guy would marry me and rescue me. I cried most nights, hurting badly. Sometimes she was sympathetic. I asked to be taken to hospital, she declined, telling me that I didn&#x27;t want to be a mental person, that there was nothing wrong with me, and that I was being overdramatic. She finally got sick of my crying and snapped, telling me she&#x27;d &#x27;give me a fucking good slap, just like my cousin gets from \[auntie&#x27;s name\] when she&#x27;s being hysterical&#x27;. I self harmed, she called me an attention seeker.

She has gaslighted me before - once logging into my [Ask.fm](https://ask.fm/) account, sending anonymous messages to my boyfriend at the time in order to break us up, and other people at my school. I knew she had done it because I received replies in my inbox to messages I had never written, written in her specific style of typing. When I confronted her she acted like I was a horrible person for accusing her of doing such a thing, yelling, &#x27;how dare you&#x27; etc. She would read through all of my MSM chats, facebook conversations, my texts - I had no privacy. I didn&#x27;t have many friends because I was scared to invite them round (though this improved a little when I got older. Admittedly my mum was never terribly mean in front of them, though would often mock me). I was frightened to ask her for most things, because she would use it against me later. If she had bought me new clothes (which I did not ask for, due to being afraid to ask for things), she would tell me that she did so much for me, that she had done &#x27;x&#x27; &#x27;y&#x27; and &#x27;z&#x27;, I was spoiled and selfish and ungrateful.  I wasn&#x27;t allowed a lock on my door and shared a room with my sister until I was 18. I still don&#x27;t have a lock on my door, and she still bursts in whenever she feels. She often threw away/still throws away my possessions or goes through them without asking me, though admittedly I lack the backbone to confront her about anything now, least of all everything that has happened. If I ever tried to stand up for myself, even just a whisper, it would be back to slapping me around and screaming in my face. Yet when my younger sister stood up for herself, she&#x27;d back down.

She wouldn&#x27;t let me apply for my American citizenship. I&#x27;m from the UK, she is dual. I would have been too had she signed on for my renewal at 21, but she didn&#x27;t. because &#x27;why would I want to live there&#x27; (brief context: lived there previously for a few years and we moved back to England, things didn&#x27;t work out too well and the move caused her to hate my father). She knew I wanted to go back to the USA badly, and she wouldn&#x27;t let me.

**(University to present day)**

Weirdly, her behaviour seemed to change after I went to university. I think it was because I developed some social skills and independence - perhaps I&#x27;ve become &#x27;better&#x27; in her eyes: I learned how to dress, do better make-up too, lost weight, managed me own money, asked for hardly any assistance (and made very sure what I did receive off my parents, that I paid back as soon as possible). Funnily enough, she tried to prevent me from going, actually, telling me that I had to stay at home for about 5 years when I wanted so badly to leave. My self esteem was in tatters, I was depressed, and I was very emotionally dependent on others, particularly boyfriends. So I worked for 11 months. She believed that she would get &#x27;found out&#x27; and imprisoned if I applied for student finance.

Why couldn&#x27;t I go? Because she lied about being separated from my father in order to claim benefits. Some may say this was scummy, though she supposedly did it to keep a roof over our head - we didn&#x27;t have a fixed interest mortgage and the recession had hit. This went on for years without mine and my sister&#x27;s knowledge until I was planning to go to uni - until she dropped this bombshell. She claimed that she was too scared for me to apply for student finance, because she had to state her martial status. On one hand, she didn&#x27;t want to continue the lie, on the other hand, she didn&#x27;t want to tell the truth, because she&#x27;d be imprisoned. So, she was going to wait until my sister was old enough to go to university, and then we wouldn&#x27;t be receiving extra child benefit anymore.

In the end, she told the council that there had been a reconciliation, because someone called for an investigation, with the belief that my dad was still living with us (and he was, when he was home for the weekends) (I don&#x27;t know who that person was, but thank you, thank you so much. You were my guardian angel).

**(A bit about my partner)**

My then (/present) boyfriend knew of my mothers behaviour, and has supported me emotionally this whole time. Throughout university, and also in my boyfriend&#x27;s presence, I seem to be very vulnerable. I cry quite a lot, I&#x27;m very sensitive. At home I learned to hide this side of me because my mother would ridicule me or tell me to snap out of it, so being emotional around her didn&#x27;t even seem like an option. I think it&#x27;s because I feel so comfortable around him, but I&#x27;m worried that I&#x27;m stuck in a toxic pattern of being too dependent and being constantly upset. I wasn&#x27;t close to my sister - perhaps because I felt she was favoured, and it seemed like we didn&#x27;t get on anyway, we were like chalk and cheese.

Sometimes I worry that I&#x27;m unintentionally pushing my boyfriend away, though he insists I&#x27;m not. He has been, truly, absolutely wonderful, kind, and incredibly patient, but I don&#x27;t want to burden him. I get panic attacks, very, very, hysterical sometimes when I remember what happened to me. I get rapidly cycling negative thoughts, I hit myself, pull my hair and insult myself (sometimes saying things my mother said) when I&#x27;m particularly far gone in one of my episodes. I can&#x27;t seem to be reasonable and calm down. I know it&#x27;s irrational, but I feel as if I am possessed. It feels like a compulsion and that I&#x27;m being sucked into a negative void.

This doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but I know that if I work hard, I can make this go away some day. I&#x27;m still quite needy, but he enjoys affection, and I&#x27;m working on it. I truly want to work on everything, resolve this trauma and I want more than anything else just to be stable and a good girlfriend. Sometimes my anxiety has let to me constantly second guessing myself, wondering if I&#x27;m good enough for him, wondering if I&#x27;m doomed to destroy our relationship because of this belief that I&#x27;m a bad, horrible person and I don&#x27;t deserve him. I find being rational very difficult when I&#x27;m in these anxious or depressive states and get decision fatigue, and uncertain of my identity. I&#x27;m horribly ashamed to say it, but I almost cheated on him twice. I was and still am absolutely disgusted with myself. It was wrong. That&#x27;s the bottom line. I am in no way trying to justify my behaviour.

Our boundaries with others were a little blurred. While I was at university, boyfriend and I both agreed we could kiss other people, as long as it didn&#x27;t go too far. But I let it get too far. There was no real definition, I guess, with what &#x27;too far&#x27; meant, aside from going all the way to sex.

We have both talked through this and I believe it&#x27;s resolved. This is not an excuse, but I think it was mostly due to me not knowing how to deal with (what should have been) a harmless crush combined with my volatile emotions and overthinking - I felt as if I was a horrible person for liking someone else, and that these feelings, in my overthinking mind, suggested to me that I was somehow insincere in my love to my boyfriend. I let myself get too close emotionally and physically to these other people. I did not sleep with either of them, but there was kissing involved, and I slept in the bed of one of them (fully clothed) while I was very <mark>drunk</mark>. I was very <mark>drunk</mark> each time.

I know these uncertain thoughts were untrue - I love my boyfriend very much. I was making myself very sick. I worried that I was inherently polyamorous and that I didn&#x27;t deserve to be with him, because I&#x27;d ruin his life (I know now that I am not - I recognise that getting a crush does not mean that). I was horribly confused, blindly following my emotions, and being kind of a dick, to be honest. Stupidly, I liked being flirted with. It felt... I don&#x27;t know. Validating, maybe. It felt good, to feel attractive, after being made to feel ugly for years, both by my mother and my peers at school. I hope nobody takes that as a justification - I know how ridiculous and selfish that sounds now. I didn&#x27;t need that. I had, and luckily, still have, an incredibly wonderful person. who tells me I&#x27;m beautiful every day. I tell him he&#x27;s beautiful too - because it&#x27;s the truth, he is, inside and out. I can&#x27;t believe his loveliness.

I&#x27;ve made some very stupid, emotionally charged decisions in the past that have hurt him, and yet he stays by my side. My self esteem is often in tatters because I feel like I&#x27;m simply not good enough. I want so badly to be a better person for him. I know I&#x27;m unhealthy. But I would like to be healthy. I want to do it for myself, as well as him. I want to get my self-respect back, and my confidence. For once, I would like to be his rock, if the time ever comes. I want to return the bravery and kindness and understanding he has given to me. I do try my best, presently. I&#x27;m not completely in tears all the time, but it&#x27;s often enough to make me want to do something about it. I would like to do even better. I want to get to the point where I&#x27;m happy with myself, where I have a spine, where I am certain in my decisions and general judgement.

I have tried to go to therapy before, but I become frightened and miss appointments, because I hate reliving everything. I know this will have to be something I overcome, because I&#x27;m not making progress by being fearful.

For the most part, I do have good days, and I&#x27;m positive, and feel like I can do it. Despite everything, I&#x27;m usually fairly even tempered. My partner and I often have great fun together and very happy times. I want to take my unhealthy behaviour out of the picture as much as I can. I know deep down that even though I&#x27;ve made some mistakes, that I&#x27;m not an intrinsically bad person, and that I will overcome this. I am going to the doctors tomorrow. I will absolutely do it.  For both of us.

I believe my feelings about my mother often lead to my emotional melt-downs. Even talking about her to my partner raises my heart-rate and makes me feel extremely stressed, putting me in a negative cycle of thoughts. I hate to say it, but while I&#x27;ve told friends and some of his family about her, nobody else really sees me cry. Apart from my little sister, for the first time the other day. She caught me in a panic attack. I explained things... finally. After all these years. And she understands. At least, I have one more ally now. She confided in me too. She&#x27;s been getting anxiety so badly that she feels physically sick before going to work, getting on the bus, having any kind of social interaction that is unplanned. Maybe it runs in our family. That would maybe explain my mother, too, and why she was so volatile.

I don&#x27;t want to have to keep being like this in front of him. Or in front of her, or anyone. He doesn&#x27;t deserve to see him girlfriend cry every week. She doesn&#x27;t deserve to see her big sister being a mess. Oddly, I tend to be a little better controlled when I&#x27;m by myself, though I still cry sometimes. I tend to feel the most emotional around him, possibly because my guard is down. Maybe I&#x27;ve been overindulging in my feelings around him way too much. I just want it to stop. He shouldn&#x27;t be my emotional punching bag. I don&#x27;t want to be an attention seeking, but maybe that&#x27;s subconsciously exactly what I&#x27;m doing. I know how needy I am. It scares me. I Just want to be happy and relaxed around my partner as much as I can, affectionate, of course, but not so emotionally dependent on him. God knows that he tries. He tries for me so hard. I truly don&#x27;t want to exhaust him.

I hate that she makes me still feel this way. I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll become her some day.

**(Conclusion)**

As I said, my mother changed her tune. I am back living with her now. Oddly, she hasn&#x27;t lashed out at me once. It&#x27;s been a few months. I feel like I&#x27;m even building a friendship with her.  It&#x27;s like a complete 180. I have many questions. I think about this all the time. She can still be a little controlling, but now we actually get on. I find it difficult to wrap my head around. I catch myself being privately incredibly critical of her and any comments she makes, when, taking away the context, she isn&#x27;t saying anything too bad. She&#x27;ll text me while I&#x27;m at my partners house, telling me to make sure I check the train times before I get home, otherwise I&#x27;ll be &#x27;stuck&#x27;, and I find myself getting overly irritated with something that is so benign. I asked my partner if I&#x27;m overreacting to her niggly comments, and he said a little, though only minus the context of past.

Despite everything, I wonder if I should forgive her. I know that I won&#x27;t forget, that&#x27;s the issue. Those painful memories are holding back some of my forgiveness. Sometimes I am still tempted to cut her off, when I have the means to leave. But I feel like she&#x27;s trying. Part of me is actively trying, too. Maybe she&#x27;s understood that what she did to me was wrong. She doesn&#x27;t have many friends, and she still hates my father. She tried to split up with him last year, and she&#x27;s having an affair. This is another complication. I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t get involved in their relationship, though she&#x27;s confided this in me. Am I supposed to show loyalty to my mostly absent father here?  Is it the morally right choice to tell him, leading to further destruction of our family?

I apologised to her, a few weeks ago, for my behaviour during my adolescence. Maybe, upon reflection, this was a little calculated on my part... though after some months after me being home, I felt we were making progress as mother and daughter, and did, to some degree, genuinely mean my apology. So I guess I was hoping for a little something back. Perhaps even just an acknowledgement that she&#x27;d hurt me. Her response was: &#x27;Oh, don&#x27;t be silly. You were just being a teenager.&#x27;

I just don&#x27;t know anymore, Reddit. What do I make of this? Is it my duty to make something of this relationship with my mother and forget the past? Should I try, if it&#x27;s been going well? I know that despite everything, as I mentioned earlier, she&#x27;s a human being. Perhaps she was in pain, and felt the need to take it out on me. I&#x27;m not trying to justify it, but I just want to understand, I guess.  I think I&#x27;m too scared to ask her anything anyway. I feel like she&#x27;ll just deny everything and return to her old self. That fear is constantly underlying.

I already know what I have to do to be a better girlfriend, and to gain emotional stability and my self respect - therapy is the key for that. Maybe it&#x27;s the key to this too. I know she&#x27;d never come with me though. She&#x27;s adamantly against therapy and anything mental health related.

Weirdly, she even just came in and gave me a hug. I hate to say it, but it makes me uncomfortable. Part of me wishes it didn&#x27;t. I want to be kind to her, but I&#x27;m conflicted.

Where do I go from here, guys? I feel so lost.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">(Names have been changed)

Dear Jane,

Last night, among other things, you physically assaulted me (when prompted to “fuck off”), you attempted to emasculate me (“I’d hit you more but you’re such a weakling I’d be afraid to do anything”), you insulted my hair colour and my teeth. You insulted me as a son, you insulted me as a resident of this house. You took a misunderstanding about cleaning the kitchen and turned it into your screaming festival. A problem that, when understood, Ben and I began to solve. Even during this attempt you screamed at us. You were completely without reason, sense or rational thought. You were a tormenter, not a mother. You expressed everything I have come to hate about our relationship.

I don’t know how it started. Potentially with the scorn I have for your smoking – which I learned to bear after your attempt at quitting was put down by Ben’s mental health problems. Potentially with the scorn I have for your drinking – which I still manage, I still think I can stop you from being an alcoholic and seeking actual, professional support for, regardless of how unreal that prospect really is. Potentially with the regularity and irrational <mark>blow</mark>-outs that happen any time I won’t take an unreasonable demand and offer some criticism. You don’t allow criticism. You abhor introspection. You can’t challenge any aspect of your thought or behaviour and refuse to do so constantly. 


What’s awful about this is how it shows itself. It’s directed at me. 
Whenever I make a comment, I’m negative. Whenever I offer a compliment, I’m patronising. Whenever I make a request, I’m too demanding. Whenever I delay a job, I’m lazy. Whenever I remind you of a previously guaranteed commitment, I’m holding your mistakes over you. You allow me absolutely no lee-way. Every statement I make towards you, every breath or glare or sigh becomes a way of undermining you. My entire being exists only to fight you. 


But I don’t fight you. I respond to you. Yes, I am lazy. Yes, I am messy. Yes, I am sarcastic. Does that merit shouting, threatening and abusive behaviour? No. Are my supposedly poor “negotiation skills” the fault of all our conflict? No. Is it that every second we are in the same room I find the quickest exit possible? That’s true, but still no. 


It’s you. Your rampant paranoia, your belittling behaviour, your violence, your melodrama and emotional blackmail, your emasculation, your howling, your complete inability to assert yourself as a mother without resorting to anything preceding this point. I can’t handle it. I have tried, for years, to mediate the fights you find for yourself. The fights between you and George. The fights between you and Peter – that wasn’t a perfect time, there were fights then too. The fights between you and Ben – where you senselessly shout at him in an attempt to “fix him”. The fights between your ideal and favourite, Greg. I have been there to prevent any of them from escalating. I have been there to oversee who isn’t listening. Who is being uncaring, who is being cruel, who is being manipulative. 


All the fights we’ve had, have been just us. No-one has stepped in to say “that was too much”, “don’t talk about his parents that way”, “that was unfair of you” while we fought. Because I have been there every time to say them. You may not remember or worse, you may not care, but that’s been the only thing I’ve felt capable of as your son, is to protect you from yourself and your aggression. From the aggression of George, and Gregg and Ben. Even when you purposefully antagonise them, even when you insult George’s parents, when you constantly deride Ben’s weight, when you emasculate Gregg, I will be there to try and keep both parties grounded.


Maybe I’m useless. Probably, given the state of this family. Maybe it’s self-indulgent attempts at mediation that lead to the kind of conflict you and me have, where you think I’m never on your side just because I call you out on all the horrible little things you do in a fight. All the disgusting name-calling, all the threats, all the awful, demeaning statements like “you should have been hit more when you were younger”. Things that you have said, appalling, disgraceful things. You are distressingly talented at harming this family emotionally Jane. You have an enormous amount of practice. 


I am writing this note because I want to express in written word my complete ignorance as to how this situation came about. To be frank, I don’t think that it’s me. When I was younger, it was “my videogames”. As I grew older, it was “John this, and John that” – we had a taste of that last night when you asked me to call him and move in with him. Lately it’s been “my fucking debating” which has <mark>forced</mark> me to be so confrontational. But nothing has changed. I’ve always been a mediator. I’ve always stepped in during fights, physical or verbal, at home or outside. Someone has to. 


I am sincerely worried that you are frayed Jane. That you are constantly worrying about issues outside of your control that when an issue falls within your small sphere of influence that it drives you mad to fix it. Your inability to solve the family’s issues by yourself leads you to think that our family would be fine if even it looked that way. If the landing was clear, if my room was clean, if the kitchen was perpetually tidy and organised. Disregarding the fact that we need a skip to clean this house, that many teenagers and young adults’ rooms are messy – particularly after just returning from a hugely stressful job with little downtime – that kitchen’s are by their nature messy places, and most are more sparsely stocked and more luxuriously spaced than ours. 


Your issues appear when you fail to exert any maternal authority over your children, who are so driven to apathy by a brief request that we tend to delay actually doing jobs until it is too late. You meekly request something is done, and instead of qualifying with some assertion, you wait. And when the job isn’t done, you throw plates (figuratively speaking – though I was constantly afraid you would douse me with boiling coffee tonight) and crack open. 


There is a sick irony to your mantra that I need to improve my “negotiation skills” when you have absolutely no ability to negotiate or engage in any form of familial diplomacy unless there is a fight between myself and Greg, as rarely as it happens. But that’s because you don’t have a rational issue, you are overcome with negative emotion by living in a house with a man who you not only don’t love, but most likely openly despise. With a son who has had his career, his body and his mind ruined by schizophrenia. With a son who is the embodiment of Jack the Lad, but has little respect for you beyond lip service and food advice. With a son who is resoundingly negative, consistently depressed and anxious. Who retreats to his room to avoid interactions with the family because of the stress it causes him. Who has described “home” as the only place he could have gone that was more stressful than the aforementioned stressful job he had been working at the time. Who you don’t, and seemingly can’t understand. Who you don’t approach for the fear of pushing further away. Who you deride for having no financial independence while he struggles to find work and maintain it while fulfilling the expectations a “genius student” has put on them – to little success. 


I don’t understand you Jane. I can’t. I’ve tried and tried to see you as a mother, but the time when I relied on you for emotional support has long since gone. The time when I could discuss my issues with you and expect to receive help has passed. The unconditional love and comfort I felt when I hugged you has gone. It’s been replaced with tension, when I feel you are going to start a fight. It’s been replaced with introspection, so I can be my own counselor. It’s been replaced with stoicism and a hard heart. You’ve made it difficult to love anyone Jane. You’ve challenged and undermined my feelings for you so consistently that I don’t feel safe to care about you. You never give me any security that you would follow the advice I give you – to medicate your depression with anti-depressants and not alcohol; to attend a support group for families dealing with schizophrenia – even when one is offered; to be firm and frank about your problems with my behaviour instead of waiting to boil over in an attempt to exert dominance. 


How could I love that? How could I care about something that insults me, that attempts to manipulate me, that assaults me? It’s inhuman. It’s the furthest thing from what a “mother” is supposed to be. I can’t think of a role that suits you worse. I’ve tried to be more of a parent than you are. I’ve hugged you when you cried, I’ve commended your conversations with Ben when you treat him with dignity and resolve, I’ve listened to your complaints about the other members of this family. I can’t be your son after doing these things. I can’t be your friend after all the woes you’ve put on me. I can’t forgive you and show a vulnerability I’ve hidden for years, potentially a decade. When that happened, when you fought again, struck me again, degraded me again, I’d have nothing. I wouldn’t have a mother, just a broken heart. 
I can’t respect you because of that. I can’t love you because of that. I can only exist while you exist, and I can’t feel bad for that. Do you expect me to?

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps due to this personality quirk, I cannot stop imagining myself as a cog actively working towards destruction  whenever I go to work, drive a car, buy a product, or consume anything. I just no longer see the point AT ALL. I would sum up my thoughts lately as &quot;WHY THE FUCK ARE ANY OF US DOING ANY OF THIS SHIT AND PRETENDING THIS IS NORMAL?&quot;.

I don&#x27;t view my job as horribly destructive - but it&#x27;s not doing a damn thing to change anything either. It&#x27;s just a status quo job, meant to feed my status quo life.

I have tried therapy. For a few reasons I don&#x27;t think it has been effective - basically I don&#x27;t trust therapists for the same reasons: I see them as part of a system that prioritizes creating good workers over caring about helping me achieve self-actualization. I know thats harsh and anyone who has ever been a therapist here now hates me. I don&#x27;t think therapists are bad people - I think they&#x27;re incredibly selfless people.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think people are subject to the forces that systems exert on them and the current system is ruining all of us.

I feel like if I can&#x27;t get myself directly engaged in changing things then I am going to go crazy and kill myself, however I have no fucking clue how to do that. I have participated in political activism but I  don&#x27;t want to participate in partisan activism - its too indirect. If I had a direction I feel like I could be patient, but right now I&#x27;m just spinning in circles noticing problems I don&#x27;t have the power to fix.

I&#x27;m down to nothing but extreme ideas so I guess just vote for your favorite:

basic skills: code, create graphics and visualizations.

A) try to teach self to be lawyer, write legislation

B) try to teach self data viz, visualize problems more clearly for others with power and influence (this is less direct, less likely to work, but closer to skills I have already)

C) write editorials? I don&#x27;t fucking know ... write in whatever you want here

D) give up and move to another country (might be too old to be accepted, could realize everything is still fucked)

E) run off to the woods, likely fuck it up like McCandless

F) try out legal euthanasia and probably have the biggest net positive impact on the system possible

G) &#x27;Suck it up, buttercup. Life is amazing and everything isn&#x27;t as bad as you say it is&#x27; or some variation</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;ll be changing names for everyone who is included in this confession.  Also if you happen to know who i am from my story i wish you would respect my anonymity and just listen.

Also i&#x27;m sorry for any typos. 


 As a child i was already subjected to emotional abuse, i was never physically beaten but some part of me wished i was as the pain would have eventually ended. Growing up i wasn&#x27;t neglected but i was effectively ignored to the point where in my adult life i have chosen to be a mute and to hide my feelings and to assert myself into things that would allow me to accept my life. To better explain my childhood, we would have the usual &quot;talk about your day&quot; around the table but when it was my turn it became a free for all and i was never allowed to express how good or terrible my day may have been. To the parents reading this. Listen to your children and be available, a child needs to be heard even if what we say seems like gibberish and nonsense we still need attention and by being there you can avoid turning it into some kind of terrible attention seeking action like being a mean little prick for no reason. My life wasn&#x27;t set like that though, i wasn&#x27;t religious and my family wasn&#x27;t either and the thought of a God or any being controlling or just watching wasn&#x27;t prevelant in my life but i was always compelled to be good and to never harm another. Fast forward until i was in pre-school (yes i have a great memory and i can recall these events at will)where i met my first bully, his name was Gus. This child hated me beyond belief and i could never understand why. He would physically hurt me, tease me, call me names and once poured an entire cup of sand into my ear during beach day. I have had hearing issues since and i wish no one would have to deal with such things. This was the first time i ever acted &quot;bad&quot; as i would call it. Towards the end of the year i had a chance to get revenge. (revenge is empty. Be stronger than me and move passed it please) the third to last day of pre-school we were playing on the swings and i saw him running around so i stopped swinging and stood there and waited until he came closer to pick on me. He eventually stood in front of me and so i swung back as hard as i could and kicked him right in the jaw as hard as i could while swinging. Yes it felt great the moment i did it but to watch how much i hurt him, how much blood such a child could spill from his face was one of the things i still see today. I wished i never hurt him, i wish i just jept being strong and resisting him but i guess my breaking point was just hit and i couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. lets skip ahead maybe 3-4 years when i met my second bully(this will be a theme for awhile) his name was brent. A large child who towered over everyone else and he damn well knew it. I was still small and skinny as my barrelchest which is a curse in disguise hadn&#x27;t become an issue just yet. Yet again this kid just hated me. He would rip up my work and somehow convinced the teacher it was me, he would write on the desks and walls, he once clogged the toilet and got everyone to believe it was my fault. This kid made me feel like a giant piece of shit and it was so much that i started to feel hatred for myself as well. One day at recess we were playing tag and i remember him grabbing me from behind as you would in a so called &quot;bear hug&quot; (you probably don&#x27;t believe this part) i crouched so i could jump and i slammed my head into his chin causing him to break a few teeth and immedietly cause him to release me. Now because he was clearly hurt and i wasn&#x27;t guess who got in trouble?
After that he calmed down but he starts again in high school but this story is going to drag on long enough as it is. 

Lets talk about some of the people who were positive in my life for a bit, the story is going to jump a bit so just hold on tight for a few minutes. 

Around this time i joined up on the baseball team and met my then to be best friend who i will call jim. Jim and i were your sterotypical best friends who would ride bikes around the dirt roads and go swimming or stay up late whenever we wished. It was a childhood that children are prohibited from having these days and honestly i never thanked Jim for how good he was for me and how much he made me feel like a human being and not just another punching bag. Jim and i had our fights and he even moved away once to return a few years later to which he found a woman and now has a child. I truly wish jim and his family the best because i&#x27;m not sure he knows how much i look back on our childhood and just wish i could have kept life like that. 

The second friend who i sadly drifted away from was dave. He was extremely into baseball and working hard and he proved it everyday. Him and his father were constantly at the field practicing and it was always nice to just pop in anytime we wanted to practice our game or just to hang out or get advice from his father. I didn&#x27;t hang out with dave much outside of baseball but he was always such a postive individual and i&#x27;m sad to say this because until all my other friends he was a single child. His mother tried to have children several times but he was the only one would made it and she constantly expresses how happy she is that he made it. Dave was the kid you wanted to be friends with when you wanted to be active as he wasn&#x27;t into video games or even movies. He was always into yard work or sports and he loved nothing more than his grandparents who were fortunate to live ao close. Thank you dave for always showing me that success can be shown in many ways and even though we don&#x27;t talk much i&#x27;m still glad to see you and your family every other day or so. 

How about we add a girl into the mix? Let me introduce my first female friend AND first gay friend into the mix. Her name was hannah and she was such a typical tomboy. Always hanging out with the boys and she was probably tougher than all of us too if i was completely honest. Hannah had a rough life and i wish she didn&#x27;t move so we could still be in contact. Her father ran the local boy scouts and her mother worked as the school cook along side my own mother. Her father fell ill and passed away around the time she was 16 and it was a massive <mark>blow</mark> to the entire community since her father was loved very much by adults and children. I personally want to thank him for showing me that being an adult doesn&#x27;t have to be boring or tedious. You can still act like a child and be an adult and he was constantly finding new ways to make life fun. What a lovely guy, i hope whatever is in the beyond when you pass is taking good care of him. Her mother was just as lovely and caring. My mother and her had a close bond until around the time her husband died. Out of stress and grief she remarried and moved on to another state. About a year ago we got word that she was hit and killed while on her motorcycle. I&#x27;m not religious but bless her for being such an amazing person to everyone she knew. Back to Hannah, a girl who would kick your ass in arm wrestling and still watch chick flicks. Growing up was hard for her since being gay was still a touchy subject at the time but she was never afraid of who she was and she always had this smile on her face that made everyone cheerful. After her fathers passing she grew up a bit and moved out west to which i&#x27;ve had no word of her since then. I hope shes well and i hope her tragedies don&#x27;t cause her too much trouble. Hannahs life actually taught me an extremely important lesson that i didn&#x27;t understand until years later. Which is that life ends rather if you&#x27;re a saint or a sinner and we need to be thankful for every second we get with anyone because you just never know whats going to happen. Plain and simple, bad things happen to extraordinary people and theres nothing we can do about it. I hope the best for you too Hannah and i hope you&#x27;re doing well. Hannah met a lot to me and i never showed it and i do regret that. 

High school was a haze for me with the bullying and my first love so forgive me that i can&#x27;t remember all the friends i wish i could. 

One of the biggest friends i had who i also drifted from was carl. Carl was an interesting kid. His father and mother split when he was young and his bother(who looked like an older version of him) both drove their father from the house with bats promising to kill him if he ever returned. Carl showed me how life is without a father and a single mother who is constantly working. Carl and his brother were great kids who were hust dealt a bad hand. They both fell into drugs and they simply never climbed the ever growing walls out of the well. His brother persude music while he (much like me) hadn&#x27;t a clue where or what he should do. He actually was a very fantastic writer (he would give me shit about how bad this post is) but he always hid it. Emotions were hard for the boys to show since they were never shown any themselves. I often made sure to tell carl he was loved and would even hug him which was very awkward for him but my lesson from hannah showed me you have to show your feelings if you truly care for someone. Carl for a few years until he moved was very much like a brother to me(i&#x27;ll talk about my own brother soon)
We hung out all the time and of course got in more than enough trouble. A few years ago he moved to the city and got into a bad crowd of people, he is still desperately trying to break free from them and i hope he can since he actually has a very bright future as a writer if he would embrace it. 

I&#x27;m sure this friends section is dragging on so i&#x27;m going to bunch a fair amount of the last ones together in a group. Trenton, dan, carls older brother darell and rick(not a TWD reference sorry) these guys were years older than me probably about 5-6 years older but they let me hang with them which meant the world to me. So pathetic that i had to piggy back off my brothers friends just to have friends. Anyways trenton was a big part of the group. He was always positive regardless of the fact that his mother passed and his father was a bit overbearing. He was very mature for his age as he would hold conversations with all our parents and was such a caring person. He felt like an extra older brother and although i have no clue where he is now i do hope things are well for him. He always made me feel like one of the guys which meant so much to a kid who was usually ignored. Dan was the smart one who always knew something about whatever you were discussing. He often would correct you which was nerve racking but when you know the right answer i suppose it is your resposibility to make sure others are informed as well. Dan went on to work closely with children and was very much loved by them, he was partier by night and child chaperone by day and honestly i think he loves it more than he admits. We still talk and hes such a modest and nice guy. Darell was probably most like me if you wanted to match me to one. He was a caring soul who was passionate about the things he loved but because he was never taught how to express how he felt he often just stayed quiet and just listened unless talked to. He never wanted anyone to know but you could see the pain in his eyes from his family, his housing situation and his job which called him in every hour they possibly could. I wish we could have talked more since he often said insperation things when he did talk. Last i knew of him he was working always 24/7 and was basically out of contact. Last is Rick. Have you guys ever seen the movie with robin williams where he aged at a very quick rate? Well rick wasn&#x27;t aging fast but you&#x27;d think he was. Rick(never measured) probably stood a good 7 foot and was just a giant among us normal sized humans. We used to joke with him that hes secretly 40 and just doesn&#x27;t want to accept it. Rick once invited us all over to his house(3rd oldest house in our town) and it was so wonderful. All the guys were there and we had one of our first guy moments where we sat down and just all had a good heart to heart. We had such a wonderful time playing games and just generally shooting the shit. He was so inviting and i always made sure to let him know(although i was the outcast) that we enjoyed having him around. (He was homeschooled so i&#x27;m sure he often felt like the outsider) the guys were wonderful and although i lost contact with them i&#x27;ll never forget how fun it was to hang out with them even if it was just for a short while. 

Alright now that some of the character are in play lets get back to where we left off alright? How about we skip right to high school. 

My first year in high school was actually terrifying. All the stories you hear about bullies and teachers and school in general frightened me since my previous years were already filled with those things. 
I mainly want to talk about my first love. Her name was Val. She was the short acne riddled blond blue eyed girl that i fell head over heels for. She was a quiet and shy girl with few friends and her interaction with others showed just how scared she was of being hurt. Anyways i mustered up the strength to become friends with her in the first few weeks. This &quot;relationship&quot; lasted until i was 18. Her and i was pretty close friends who even watched porn together. I loved her so much but i was too much of a chicken to tell her. I remember we skipped class once to sit with each other and just talk. I miss those times so much. Just to be with someone you love makes you feel so weird. Butterlies fill your stomach, your steps feel lighter, air seems fresher, the birds always sing when you see them. You truly feel invincible and even though these feelings were short i will never forget them. As the years passed my love grew and i got to know her more and more to the point that she finally confessed she had an eating disorder. Val suffered from bulimia(she threw up after every meal) please please please to anyone reading this. If you have anything like this then PLEASE let someone in. Let someone help please. Don&#x27;t let yourself be consumed by the sickness. Someone out there cares, dont push them away no matter how scared you are. 

Val confessed to drinking perfume in the summer to become sleepy so she could just sleep her life away. We never talked about her family situation but i&#x27;m sure something was going on. Regardless she was unwilling to let me help no matter how much i tried. She just kept shutting me out. This was around the time that the worst thing that could ever happened finally did. Her one other friend who was her best friend of 9 years had a falling out and told the entire school of her eating disorder. She was bullied unmercifully for the next year and even my own guardian type influence i had with several groups couldn&#x27;t stop it. I would often be tackled by a crying Val wishing for a comforting hug. It was selfish but i enjoyed these times as i actually got to comfort someone i truly loved. I tried so had emotionally and physically to show her that even if i was the only one who cared that i truly would do anything for her. I did too much to write down but one of the things i remember clearly was my ceramics project. Val was a huge fan of elephants and the color purple so i tried to make her this lovely purple elephant teapot which i think looked pretty good(i still have it somewhere i think but i hid it to stop the pain) i tried to give it to her but she declined and refused any of my comfort or gifts. After that Val started dating other boys who clearly just wanted her for her body(Vals acne cleared up and she became a young looking avril lavegne) Val was so stuck into wanted to be accepted that she looked passed it. I had to endure months of Val explaining her like of guys and her eventual hatred of them when they hurt her. Having to see and listen to someone you love fall into the same trap over and over was so emotionally scarring that it still effects me. I often asked myself why. Why? Why can&#x27;t i get a chance? Maybe i wasn&#x27;t right for her but why couldn&#x27;t i have a fair chance to see? It didn&#x27;t matter because at that point i was just a backup friend and i knew it. I loved her too much to leave though. Val eventually couldn&#x27;t take the heartbreak and bullying anymore and changed schools. No more than a few weeks and her secret was also outted there as well forcing her into homeschooling. Val and i didn&#x27;t talk much after that and she and i fell into a great depression. So deep that i actually stopped going to school for my entire 10th grade year. We text rarely and when i did return to school i became the boy who chased a ghost. The school saw my love for her and saw it as a silly real life drama and decided to belittle me for it. One kid in particular was henric, a short kid who was maybe less than half my size (remember my barrel chest) just always got on my nerves. Every name in the book was thrown at me, hell the book itself was thrown at me too. He was a nasty little child who just liked being mean to me. A few months passed until he decided to make a move(a very dramtic one) one day during tech ed he thought it would be a cool idea to try to push me into the ban saw. I&#x27;m overjoyed that he was just a little shit who tried to move a mountain. At that point my frustration with him became too high and i had to do something. I picked him up and slammed him on the tile floor. He kicked back a few feet and thats when i flipped a table so it was dividing the two of us. I looked at this kid cowering on the floor while a class of 15 or so other kids looked on and i spit out a few sentences that ended my bullying for the rest of high school. &quot;Do you see how far you&#x27;re from me? If you ever cross farther then where this table sits then i will kill you henrik. I will pick you up from your midget stance and i will break your back on my knee, i will drag you through the halls and i will slam you into the nearest trash bin because you&#x27;re nothing but a piece of god damn trash&quot; i was suspended for a few days after that but hey i was left alone for the rest of school. Henrics brother died in a fire shortly after and i actually felt bad for him even after the way he treated me. 

Anyways a few weeks after that my mother was fired from the school under new management which devastated her so much that she formed an illness called Agoraphobia. My mother couldn&#x27;t even walk to her own mailbox becausw her anxiety got so bad she woulf almost have a heart attack(this isn&#x27;t made up. This stuff is real and its scary) i am a mamas boy. I will admit that with pride. I dropped school my senior year (i never graduated) and i took care of my ill mother full time. Still under crushing depression that hurt me physically i still cared more for my mother than myself. 
Fast forward a year or so until my 18th birthday. The last birthday i will ever celebrate happily. I was unemployed taking care of my mother living at home and honestly i was actually feeling happier, that was until 2:16 AM April 16(date changed to help stay anonymous) my brother was in a near fatal care crash with a <mark>drunk</mark> driver. 
I was never a fan of drugs but i actually have a personal crusade against them now. My brother(to summerize) was in a coma for 9 months and now has to live his life with his wonderful wife and 2 children as a quadrapaligic. I will never forgive the person who did this and i pray everyday that he gets to run with his children someday. This event caused a relapse in my mother and damn near destroyed our family not to mention this was the time that i told Val that i couldn&#x27;t carry on and i expressed my feelings. She rejected me and treated me as if i was a stranger... The amount of drama and heartache that goes on during this could never be captured it one of those abc family dramas or whatever. There was a change that radiated through the entire community. Our house was renovated to accomidate him, ramps had to be built, doorways resized, special measures had to be taken.i had to backseat my heartbreak for while.  The first few months were the most terrifying moments of my life. Seeing someone who you used to fight with, play with, run with, swim with and hundreds of other things is now laying there unable to do almost anything but breathe. Later on his condition improved and his arms are working although limited. It still rips me apart inside when i think about seeing him mentionless in that hospital bed. It was the first time i had a breakdown. After seeing him i came back to the waiting room and smiled at my family trying to hide my pain but it was too much. The second my lips began to curl a smile a pressure in my throat pushed up and i immediately became this broken dam. I rushed from the room and leaned on a grate and looked out the window. I actually bent the grate accidently in my flurry of emotions. This mute 19 year old kid who was defined as &quot;someone you don&#x27;t fuck with&quot; is pouring tears and sobbing like a child who lost their toy and i actually had to leave the hospital because i just couldn&#x27;t keep it together. Life changed after that. I started having dreams about my brother. Dreams where he could walk but his head wasn&#x27;t all there and i would wake up crying and being greatful that he was still completely coherent. His body didn&#x27;t work but he still was there mentally and i am ever grateful for that. The hardest part was acceptence. No one wants to accept what happened. Its something people fight with their entire lives and i pray they can move on. Having dreams of what someone used to be like will kill you emotionally until physically you just give up. This was a struggle for years and even 7 years later its really hard to accept that he may never get the pleasures we have ever day. Be thankful for the ones you love and the ones who love you. Be thankful you can get out of bed in the morning without assitance. Also you better be damn well thankful if you have a partener who stands beside you regardless of who they are you better treat them with all the love you can give because they deserve it. Be thankful if you have children because some of us aren&#x27;t able to find mates or simply can&#x27;t have any. Be thankful and grateful for everyday that you wake up. This was also the point that Val and i exchanged our last texts and these were them word for word(minus the name change)

&quot;Val i can&#x27;t do this anymore. You won&#x27;t give me a chance to show you how much i love you so i give up...&quot;

&quot;ok&quot;

Done. Thats it. Just an ok after all that time. Lemme explain also that giving up is not in my nature. Its like breaking a commandment. I&#x27;ve only given up 3 times in my life(4 soon) and Val was one of those times. 

Anyways later on when i was 19 i finally met a girl. Lets call her sara. This short adorable Asian goddess that made my life better in every single way was just everything i could ever want. Our relationship lasted right up until just a few months ago which would make it about 5 years or so. We were such a fairytale couple. Talked about our perfect future, the adventures we would have and even what we would name our hopeful children. I loved her so much and i presumed she loved me too. We used to write stories and draw together. Always watch movies and i would even leave love messages in her food. Seeing her smile was like watching the sun rise. I was finally invicible again like in highschool. Remember when i said it was a fairy tail? Well here is why. She eventually started telling lies. Deep hurtful ones that i cannot repeat. She cut me deep and i&#x27;ve been stitching the wound ever since. Giving up wasn&#x27;t for me so i foraged on and tried to forgive her. Lets fast forward our fairytail relationship until my 22nd birthday. A party was being held not for my birthday but as a celebration that my brother was still with us. I go inside for a few minutes and happen to pick up my phone and i have no idea what compelled me to do it but i went to saras twitter account and saw she was talking to other boys. I confronted her and she denied any wrong play for awhile until i received a massive text about her cheating on me for what was about a month period with a boy i somewhat knew. I was crushed. I did my best to hold a smile and keep the joy until everyone went home but inside i was rotting like a wet log. I remember telling her to leave and never come back. I went months in the darkness. Waking up everyday to the same pain in my left arm. A drill that went ever deeper into my heart was always there and everyone could see it. I was a real life droopy. I was as low and i damn well looked like i too. I stopped shaving or cutting my hair, i rarely ate, i stopped playing video games(i&#x27;m deeply passionate about them so this was a huge red flag) i even walked around like a zombie inside the house and i rarely showered. What happens to you when someone you truly love betrays you is beyond the words i have written. You stop caring about anything and everything. You think differently. You talk differently. You become something you could have never imagined. You&#x27;re a husk with no soul and only you can save yourself. Thankfully my will to live was stronger than my will to die and so i eventually got back on my feet after about a year. I cut my then scraggly hair and wizard beard, i took a long hot shower and just sat and conviced myself that i need to be ok. Not for myself but mh family. They cannot deal with another tragedy after my brother. I cannot be selfish. I have to keep going. After i got on my feet i made the worst mistake of my short young life. I contacted sara and after much discussion i accepted her into a relationship. Our relationship was a broken stick. Some glue and maybe paint and it looks good but its still forever broken and i eventually couldn&#x27;t deal with it anymore. I broke it off again and have been debating if thats it. If i&#x27;ll move on. If i&#x27;ll ever find the true one and if i&#x27;ll ever get to have children and a life of my own. 

So thats where i am. A 24 year old friendless(unless you count my cat)unemployed male who stays home and takes care of his mother and has no aspirations for the future. I just live day to day in my infinite depressive husk hoping one day i can break it open and be free. 

Some advice i have learned in my life that you&#x27;re free to avoid if you disagree. 

•Fight back against bullies. Show them you&#x27;re not to be messed with or they&#x27;ll never stop. 
•Hold your friends and loved ones close because any moment could be theirs or your last
•Be open for your children and friends. Having someone who will listen is a HUGE help. 
•You never forget your first love and its ok to think about it from time to time. Loves complicated and it always will be. Although i think the line &quot;its better to have loved and lost than never loved at all&quot; is complete and utter bullshit since you WILL experience heartbreak and you WILL find yourself at a dead end thats dark and broken and you&#x27;ll think about killing yourself a lot its still nice to feel invincible even if it was false. its up to you if you give up or not
•Most of all. Be good to others. Don&#x27;t harm others especially those you love. Everyone has a heart. Please don&#x27;t shatter such a priceless treasure. 


Thank you for listening to a Mute soul who has never had someone who would just hear his words. This story is but a fraction of my actual life but i&#x27;m grateful i could express myself here. Thank you again. 

TLDR; I rant about my life with bullies, friends, heartbreak, the almost death of a loved one, another heartbreak and then some advice topped off with a thanks for listening.

            <div class="content collapsed">This is a HUGE wall of text. Sorry

San Salvador, a city known to most of the world as the capital of the Central American country of El Salvador. Yet to my mother and her family, it’s home. Her country is a small one, plagued by the same disease that almost all Latin countries are, the plague of the Monroe Doctrine. EL Salvador is a land which has never held a consistent, self-sustaining and developing government, and at the time my mother emerged on this earth, she found herself in the middle of another governmental degradation, and eventually, revolution.


I look at my mother now, and I wonder, what could her childhood have possibly been like? I ponder on the woman before me, how she looked, how she acted. I wondered what her life was like before she arrived to this land of great liberty. I look down upon her, and wonder what she was like. I long for a day where I can envision a child, so eager, so happy, so young and carefree, to run up to me and give me a hug at my knees. I wonder if this child is thinking, what she is what she consists of in the entirety of the gravity and meaning of that word. Yet, whenever I think of this image, I can’t see a face. When I realize this, I look for one, to no avail. I never find an answer. Our species relies extremely heavily on recognition, whether it be verbal, visual, or sensual recognition.  Yet in a dream in which all you have is your sight, what good is a vision without a face? I wonder what my mother was like. I look upon pictures of her as a child, and wonder, what was behind that face? What lies beneath?


   My mother spent the first half of her childhood, and in a biological sense, the vast majority of her childhood, in her native country. She was a small child, and that stature reigns true today. She tells me of her early years, saying that she was so small that she wore the same shoes for two years, because he feet did not grow. When she was only a year and a half old, her mother had left for America.  The rest of her tenure in her country was spent under the guidance of her Grandmother, lovingly called Mama Tenchita. She was a prominent matriarchal figure to her, and the memories of her to my mother are to abundant to count, a plethora of stories incapable for me to write with the true gravity of my mother’s praise for her, a testament to the great woman that she was. 


My Great-Grandmother came from quite the background, the story seemingly lost and found again, a woman who could have possibly been born to wealth, yet the first half of her childhood was spent in the rural town of Cojutepeque. When she was 8, she moved to San Salvador. She bore seven children to the same man, yet only three if those seven survived. Even though she bore so many children to this man, she divorced him due to him being a womanizer and an alcoholic. She did this at a very young age, and for the rest of her life no man bore her hand.  Mama Tenchita wasn’t exactly a religious person, yet she held many cultural traditions, such as taking part in Pastorelas, which is essentially a reenactment of the Nativity scene, as well as holding Independence Day dear to her heart, and she made sure she held these beliefs close to her grandchildren’s as well. She never received a formal education, yet she was a smart woman. My mother tells me that she taught herself not only how to read, but basic mathematics as well. She was a very strong woman, who nurtured not only her 3 children, but her 10 grandchildren as well. She raised all these children off the funds she made selling and making tortillas at the Mercado. Many of my mother’s memories of home involve her, and  one of my mother’s many keen memories of Mama Tenchita lied at the Mercado. Every Sunday after church, her sisters and their grandmother would arrive at the Mercado, where they would eat pupusas fresh off the stove. My mother tells me all the time how the rest of her sisters would just devour the pupusas almost instantaneously, with the steam and hot grease still filled with the flames of hades. Yet she was never that mad, no matter how much she hungered. She says her Grandmother would open the pupusa for her first so it could cool down, then she would eat it. In fact, her grandmother would get mad at her sisters for doing that, and would do the same for them as well. The small, to many seemingly insignificant, stories of home are those that truly give an insight of what was there. 


My mother’s earliest memory lies at the Mesὀn, which is essentially a Single unit apartment where 5 households lived, sharing a restroom. At the Mesὀn, Mama Tenchita would bring Pollitos (Chicks) that she bought from the Mercado. These Pollitos were a sight to behold, as my mother said that they could be dyed different colors, and she always wanted the Red one. She remembers playing with this Pollitos many times. My Mother has told me a story, a story in which Mama Tenchita was a miracle worker. Whenever the Pollitos would die, my mother and her siblings would run to Mama Tenchita, who would get a metal pot, put it over the corpse of this freshly deceased pollito, and bang against it. What happened next is absurd, yet scientifically explainable. The Pollitos would regain life. For all we know the Pollitos weren’t even dead, they could have possibly been unconscious. Yet that is truly irrelevant, as what matters is what my Great-Grandmother did. My mother recalls playing with a large Beetle tied on a string, swinging it around in circles to hear the purr of a the wings against the wind, the decibel level increased with the momentum created by the centrifugal force. This gives you a bit of an insight of the land my mother lived in.
My mother lived in a land of low Socio-Economic status, even though she lived in the countries capital. Yet, even though everyone there was of low Socio-Economic status, my mother was of a slightly higher standing. This was due to my Grandmother wiring money to her children from the United States. She was poor, but she still went to school. She fondly remembers a man who she went to everyday after school. This man was paralyzed from the waist down, an injury he sustained during his graduation to become a teacher. This man was a tutor for Language Arts and Math, and is the reason my mother is so good at Math. Yet this man’s influence is much greater than that, and in my opinion, a pivotal man in her life today. This man is the reason that my mother is an educator today. This man, a feeble man in a lowly place, is the reason for my mother’s livelihood today. During all this, her entire childhood, in a sense, was funded from abroad, in America.


My Grandmother left for America shortly after my mother left, with her best friend Miriam. Miriam saw the desperation and struggle my Grandmother had raising 5 children on her own, and offered to take her to America as long as she would go with her. My Grandmother was a single mother not by choice like her mother before her. My Grandfather left my Grandmother when my mother was 6 months old, claiming to be leaving for Panama to work at the Canal. He told my Grandmother that he would send money to her from Panama. Yet that monetary contribution never arrived. My mother still held out hope, but her best friend Miriam, a merchant at the time, traveled frequently to Panama to sell her goods. On her ventures to Panama, she would sometimes see my Grandfather, and see him <mark>blow</mark>ing his money on women and alcohol. When she came back to El Salvador, Miriam told my Grandmother to forget about him, as it would be for the better. And it was because of this knowledge, along with Miriam’s desire for a companion on this long trip to the Land of Freedom that inspired Miriam to give my Grandmother the offer. My Grandmother accepted, knowing it would be for the better of her Grandchildren.  
My Grandmothers journey here came to an abrupt stop in Tijuana, where she and Miriam ran out of money to continue on said journey. They met their physiological needs by working for a man and woman in their home, where they essentially became indentured servants. They would clean the house, watch the kids, all for no pay and little food for sustenance. At night when they would clean, Miriam would steal some extra tortillas that were left over from that night’s dinner to give to my Grandmother. They got out of this predicament due to a loan from Miriam’s sister, who already lived in the states. A loan. When they arrived in California, they knew no one. And they arrived to what she calls the central hub, where everyone arrived, Downtown LA.  They had little money to afford housing in this expensive land, so they would sleep in the parks. Yet, the police would kick them out of these parks as that was illegal in their time.  They would drift from park to park, <mark>sleeping</mark> in power naps, getting kicked out, and going to another park, eventually arriving at the original park later on.  My Grandmother states, with emotion making her voice tremble, that yet again God put someone in their path to lend them aid. The woman, as my Grandmother says, was called Doña Cuquita. Doña Cuquita would pay my Grandmother to watch her children, and since it was out of pocket, it was below minimum wage. But my Grandmother tells me that she wasn’t paid below this wage on purpose, it was because this woman couldn’t afford to pay more. Yet my Grandmother was more than grateful to accept this, as Cuquita gave her a place to sleep and food to eat on top of the wages she paid her. Miriam, on the other hand, worked for another woman under similar conditions. Yet Miriam was not fond of working here, and she didn’t like the situation she was in. In a strange twist of fate, Miriam left my Grandmother, the reason she came to America, to go back to El Salvador. And my Grandmother was alone. From that moment on, my Grandmother wired money to El Salvador. My Grandmother, at first, would wire all of her wages to El Salvador, so much so that Cuquita would pay out of pocket the wiring fee. Later, Cuquita convinced my Grandmother to save $5 dollars a month for herself. Cuquita would buy my Grandmother clothes, etc., from the second hand store. My Grandmother worked and stayed with Doña Cuquita for about 6 months, until she got a job at a factory, working there for over 20 years, managing the factory for half that time. All the while my Grandmother was supporting her children in her home country, thousands of miles away.


The first time my mother saw her mother was when she was 4 years old. The only clear memory my mother has of this first visit is when my Grandmother took her to an amusement park known as El Teleferico. My mother tells me that her siblings and Grandmother say that on first sight of her mother, my mom ignored her and ran back to my grandmother crying, as she was a complete stranger to her. My Grandmother returned 2 more times, and on the latter of these two journeys back was when she brought them to America. When she came to get her daughters, it was during the December holidays, shortly before the New Year. When my Grandmother arrived, no one knew of her intentions to bring her children back with her to America but herself. My Grandmother kept it a secret, as she knew how devastating it would be to everyone, including her own mother. She told Mama Tenchita a few days prior to their departure to America. January 18th was the date that they left. A date that is one a very few my mother clearly remembers of her young days. My mother remembers that speech my grandmother told her and her siblings. She tells me that my Grandmother told them that they were coming here to get a better life, and to finally have a true family with a mom and a dad, and that it was going to be great. Yet they didn’t want to leave. They didn’t want to leave what they knew, what they loved, and to my mother, her Mom. Yet my Grandmother promised that they would talk to Mama Tenchita every weekend, which was a promise that was kept. Then their journey began.


Their journey began on a multitude of busses to Guatemala, and from there they departed on a different method of transportation. My mom remembers the van, an all metal van with only two windows in the front, with her and her siblings, her mother, her aunt, her cousin, and a family friend stationed in the back of this van.  While they were on the van, in Guatemala, is where my mother celebrated her 11th birthday. On the border city between Guatemala and El Salvador, her cousin took her for a walk in the city, where she bought my mother a music box. It was in this city where my mother first learned how to ride a bike from a young lad whom they became acquainted with. They left Guatemala in this van, where time passed as DNA replicates in your body, quickly, yet to the person, an indefinite and unspecific amount of time. My mother tells me of the scorching heat in this van, a heat so intense that my Grandmother tore off the sleeves of their dresses to cool them down. They took this van from Guatemala all the way to the southern border of Mexico, where they ascended into the skies on a plane from the Southern Border of Mexico to Tijuana. 
In Tijuana, my mother remembers that they stayed in a home where all the immigrants would arrive, where they stayed for the night, waiting for a man whom they called El Coyote to pick them up and take them across the border.  El Coyote guided them through the mountainous terrain on foot, where they walked for hours. It was around sunset where they arrived to their destination, the border. From their viewpoint on the mountain, they could literally see the checkpoint to enter the United States. This is where my mother and her siblings separated from their mother. The plan was for my mother and her siblings to go with El Coyote, and my Grandmother to go with El Coyote’s brother across the border, as she had her papers. However, as all good plans do, it didn’t go according to plan. While they were approaching the border checkpoint, El Coyote figured out that they were checking vehicles for immigrants. He told the girls this, and dropped them off in the middle of the mountain, promising to come back for them when the coast was clear. He never returned. They waited there for hours, until nightfall, seeing a plethora of cars pass them, waiting for El Coyote to return. It was pitch black night when they heard hurried footsteps. They were scared, being four girls alone at night in the middle of nowhere. Four young men arrived, asking why they were here in the middle of this place alone. My mother and her siblings, shivering from the cold of the desert night in winter, told them of their predicament. The young men in return told them why they were running. They said that behind them were a group of hooligans, who were drugged up and coming in their direction. The young men told the girls that if they trusted them, to follow them and they’d take them out of the mountains. It was a godsend. They followed the young men on foot through the mountains for 7 hours, dying of thirst and hunger. My mother tells me that the young men would give them gum to quench their thirst and calm their hunger, and whenever they longed for the end the men would tell them they were one hill away from the end. On this labyrinth of a journey, and one in which my mother’s almost ended when she tumbled down the mountain. Luckily, one of the four young men rescued her, and they continued through the labyrinth.


At the end, they could see victory. They were out of the mountains, and practically in the United States, when they spotted a water faucet. My Aunt Lissette, who was dying of thirst, as well as another young man, went running to the faucet. Yet when they turned it, alarms immediately sounded, and they shouted at Lissette and the man to come back so they could hide. And hide they did. They hid for approximately 30 minutes to an hour, and when they felt safe, they left. As soon as they reached the bottom of the mountain, they were in San Isidro, California. Yet, they had someone waiting there for them, immigration. 


At the Immigration Detention Center, the young men told the girls that when the Immigration asked to say that they didn’t know each other, to prevent themselves from being deported. They obliged, and the Immigration Officers sent my mother and her siblings to a spate facility where they housed the woman and children. By this moment in time, my Grandmother was losing her head, as her daughters were nowhere to be found and they were supposed to reach the house before she did. After being processed, immigration called my Grandmother and told her of her daughter’s situation. She had to wait for a judge’s ruling on the situation. The judge ruling stated that the only way they could come into the states was for my Grandmother to pay 10,000 for each child. Naturally, my Grandmother couldn’t afford it. She would call every day, begging for a different ruling, stating it was out of her means to pay 40,000 dollars for her children. She had 5 days to come up with the money. During those five days, my mother and her siblings were in jail. My Tia Sonia would wash their clothes every day, as they only had one pair, and they would lie in bed naked waiting for the clothing to dry. On the fifth day, the judge changed her ruling to 1,000 dollars per person, under the circumstance that she pay the next morning or they would be shipped back the next day. My Grandmother got the 4,000 dollars she needed from a friend named Doña Antoñieta. My Grandmother feared she would be deported if she picked her daughters up, even though she was here legally, so she asked Doña Antoñieta to pick them up for her. And she did. They were imprisoned on the 25th of January, 1985, and they arrived at their new home on Februrary 2nd of that same year.


The first six months of after their arrival here were bliss. They lived with their mother, and they would talk to their Grandmother every weekend. Yet after that, it changed. Their expectations that were met originally were shattered by their father, a horrid man who abused my mother and her siblings both physically and emotionally. My mother still holds the emotional scars from this man to this day, and it’s incredibly difficult for her to talk about it. This man, put quite bluntly, was the epitome of an asshole, and he ruined many things for my mother. Yet now, she lives happily with her husband and family in the land of the free. The last time my mother saw her father and confronted him was shortly after my birth. She told him that she had two sons and was happily married, and that he will never see us and she bid him good riddance. It was the best thing she has ever done for me, and writing this truly proved to me how much my mother loves me, so much so that she repelled her father out of my life so I wouldn’t have to deal with that heinous monster of a living being. To this day, and from every day I live, I doubt I’d ever be able to see him. I don’t think I could handle it, I’d quite frankly don’t know what I’d do to him. I know I’d tell him off, hell I might even cry, but I know for a fact that that the piece of garbage who abused and ruined many of my mother’s adolescent memories will hold a special place in hell in my heart. And I’m proud to say I love my mother with all the essence of my being, from her DNA in my mitochondria, to seeing her every day. I know I get angry with her frequently, and I get annoyed often as many of my age and standing do, but I love her and know that everything she has done for me, and her entire journey, was done out of love.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2b981f/ending_the_engagement_after_moving_across_the/" target="_blank" class="title">Ending the engagement after moving across the country together.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">We have been together for 2 years. We dated at the end of our college careers after being friends for probably 6 months. I graduated a semester before her and proposed shortly after. We had been dating for over a year. We were serious, we loved each other, often talked about the future, and had similar goals in life and relationships. Long story short, everything was really good.

The last semester she was in school, we lived together. I just got an easy job around town while she finished up. I&#x27;m in the military, so we would then be moving together across the country to my first assignment. We did that.

We moved across the country to a very remote part. She gave up her dream job on the west coast to follow me to my first assignment. That was really hard for me to know, and I appreciated her for doing it. We weren&#x27;t going anywhere either of us wanted, but at least we were going together. We got an apartment in this new town, and spent months decorating it and so forth. We were engaged, with no solid plans on when you have the ceremony and get married. I have training I have to do across the country coming up, plus we want to save up money and have the ceremony we want. So our engagement is serious, and not rushed. We were planning on getting legally married soon for some monetary benefits, but it wasn&#x27;t super necessary or urgent.

Anyways, things have been different since we moved here. We don&#x27;t know anyone, don&#x27;t have any friends. Our closest family is thousands of miles away. We only have each other. But things haven&#x27;t been good. We have been fighting and barely getting along the entire time.
In my mind, she changed after we got engaged. She was an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. Once engaged, she did change. It seemed like nothing was good enough for her. She would always want &quot;to do something&quot; instead of staying at home, but whenever we did it was never good enough to satisfy that &quot;something&quot;. She wouldn&#x27;t put any ideas forward, always wanting me to suggest things. It felt like I was always responsible for entertaining her. She then kind of became controlling and demanding. Down to the most inane things. One time we were just sitting on the couch talking and she demanded I not lean back a certain way, and got upset when I told her I could lean however I wanted. I splashed her with soap by accident when we were showering and she got mad. I put my hands on my lap when sitting next to her and she told me not to. Things like that. For months and months.

And the thing is that she would get in these horribly moods when this happened. Like, we would come home from work and have a good time. Even for a few hours as we made and ate dinner. Then one thing would happen and the rest of the night would be ruined. Barely any talking, and then she would just go to bed without saying much. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells not knowing if I was going to upset her.

The sex went down a lot. At worst, once every 2 weeks. Near the end once a week. When we dated, we would have sex multiple times per week. Part of it for me was that it became something of a chore. Sex for her wasn&#x27;t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; unless she came. For me, I just enjoyed being close. I didn&#x27;t have to come. But to make her come would require 20-30+ minutes of methodical manual simulation by me while she laid there. It wasn&#x27;t sexy or bringing us close. We could have amazing sex with an hour of foreplay but if she didn&#x27;t come, at the end of it she would still tell me to get her there. I learned that sex would always require a lot. A final note, our work schedules also influenced how much sex we had.
She also hates her job. There aren&#x27;t many options for jobs in this tiny town, and she is indeed underemployed. She did give up her dream job to be here.

After talking for a few hours, it just kinda came all unraveled. She admitted she gets angry too much. She admits she can&#x27;t talk to me or control her emotions. (She used to say &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t control my emotions!&quot; To which I pointed out that controlling your emotions is part of being an adult and not letting them getting the best of you.) She also admitted that she just doesn&#x27;t feel that connection to me anymore. She hates her job and doesn&#x27;t look forward to coming home. She just looks forward to not being at work. She said she just cant be happy here. She doesn&#x27;t feel connected to me. She said we don&#x27;t talk or hang out anymore.

I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m blaming her. I&#x27;m not. This is just from my perspective. I know I&#x27;m not innocent in all of this. But a lot of the problems stem from her being unhappy. If she were happy with these issues, I would be. I don&#x27;t feel unhappy by these things, I feel unhappy that she is unhappy. I&#x27;m fine with the location right now, I like my job, and I don&#x27;t mind being busy and doing things. I love hanging out together just doing nothing (like me on my computer next to her while she watches TV/play on iPad). Apparently to her that isn&#x27;t hanging out or being together. But none of the &quot;active&quot; things we did seemed to be good enough either.

Basically, it seems like the location and her hating her job magnified our problems, forcing us to solely rely on each other. And I guess we were better at being boyfriend/girlfriend than being fiancé/fiancée. So she is putting in her two weeks notice tomorrow at work and then moving home to the West Coast. Luckily our finances were not combined and we hadn&#x27;t gotten legally married yes. She has told her mother, I haven&#x27;t told my parents yet. I&#x27;ll also have to call her father soon and explain to him why I won&#x27;t be marrying his daughter anymore. (I asked for his blessing.)

It&#x27;s rough for me right now. I cried for the first time in probably a decade this morning, after we talked and she went to take a shower. I&#x27;m about to be very very lonely and very isolated. That&#x27;s a very tough feeling. Right now I&#x27;m just kinda tanking through this, absorbing all the <mark>blow</mark>s. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can handle it. I kinda scared myself this morning, so I went and took the bullets out of my magazine for my handgun (not loaded). Not because I was worried, but it just made me feel better. L&#x27;appel du vide/Call of the Void and whatnot. Good part about me is that nothing can hurt me. I can take all the shitty things in life and just keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just cuz I&#x27;m feeling shitty inside doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t keep moving forward on the outside. I&#x27;m still me.

tl;dr: Broke the engagement and are splitting up after moving across the country together. She is moving home 2000 miles away and I will be very alone.

Break ups are hard and I&#x27;m a little sad.

            <div class="content collapsed">I guess I’m writing this partly to “get it out” because I really cannot openly or comfortably discuss it with most people in my life, and partly in hope that at least one person will learn from my experiences and not make the same mistakes.  I&#x27;m pretty tired of hiding my past because America considers it &quot;taboo&quot;.  You can pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist all you like until people lash out in violence, then you mourn but you never attempt open your eyes to see the real problem.  Society needs to wake the fuck up on many levels.

I’d been going to various Dr’s since I was 7 years old, early on I was diagnosed with “Tourette’s syndrome” which I now as an adult firmly believe is a bullshit scapegoat diagnosis used heavily in the 90’s.  So I was medicated from the time I was 7.  I was definitely not the happiest kid, socially awkward and retracted from the outside world.  Of course growing up and watching my father waste away (he has been chronically ill since I was young) really didn’t help my situation.  We never got to do the normal father and son things, in fact we really never did any father and son things.  I can count the number of times we did do things on one hand, and what should have been happy moments were instead memories of watching my father suffer through the severe pain he was being put through so we could have some “enjoyment” but given the situation it was never truly enjoyable.  I was always a person deep in thought, often not very happy thoughts, even as a young child.  Anyhow as the years went by I “grew out” of this “Tourette’s syndrome” diagnosis and grew into a lovely new hole of depression and obsession.  The majority of my young life I had but one friend, as I grew older things just became more awkward and we grew apart.  He was now “popular” and I was not.  I was the kid who attempted to quietly sit in the corner by myself at all times.   In middle school my peers began giving me a hard time.  I suppose these days you would call it “bullying” but I prefer to think they were just stupid assholes acting like stupid assholes and they probably have not changed.  I was pretty much constantly tormented all through middle school and into high school.  No fucking wonder I was depressed, but nobody in my life had a clue.  My family members didn’t get it, the psychologists I was seeing didn’t get it either and at that age I really didn’t know how to express myself to inform anyone of the dark truth’s I held deep inside.  It was the 90’s so the answer to my problems was for doctors to continue drugging me, even though none of it helped me to feel any better.  How the fuck does one expect a drug to make a person feel better about being treated like a pile of shit and constantly being tortured by the kids surrounding him?  Dumbass motherfuckers never even had a clue.
	Eventually I got fed up with everyone’s bullshit and decided I was going to teach them a lesson.  Now in high school and having grown bigger than most of my fellow students I began taking them down one at a time.  While I was once quiet, reserved and allowed the assholes of world to step all over me, I suddenly became loud, outspoken and intolerant of anyone that I found even the slightest misalignment with.  The detention and suspensions racked up quickly.  In this new found life I actually began to make some friends around 10th-11th grade.  I was now one of the “bad kids” and fit in quite well with them.  By age 17 I had still somehow managed to refrain from underage drinking and illegal drug use.  My parents had done well informing me that I did not want to be a part of that sort of life as I grew up.  It was not really an openly discussed topic however they had never been users/abusers and had instilled those morals into me.  As well I knew alcohol was responsible for ruining my father’s life, a severe car accident involving a <mark>drunk</mark> driver was the cause behind his rapidly declining health throughout my life.
	One day I just said “fuck it”, all my new friends drank and smoked weed, and I had up until this point managed to refrain but that time would soon end.  They never tried to push it on me anyhow so it was not a peer pressure thing for me, it was however to open the road to my great escape.  The first night I drank some Budweiser’s with a couple of buddies in the school yard.  It was pouring rain so we pretty much stayed put.  I didn’t get out of control wasted.  Just buzzed, but buzzed enough that the problems of life had been forgotten for a brief while.
Before I knew it I was drinking more often on the weekends, and soon enough I started smoking weed too.  Age 17 was to be the year my life changed, but not necessarily for the better.  Still having no luck with what I felt were bullshit self-serving Dr’s and their drugs I had become a very analytic person and learned much about personalities.  I knew I was very much obsessive compulsive.  I had all sorts of little things that I had to do throughout the day or it would drive me insane but fortunately I was now able to keep it in check and mostly out of sight from everyone else.  I suppose I was learning to deal with some of my issues; however the other half of me was getting ready to boil over.  
	Now about 17 ½ I was drinking and smoking weed fairly often but not so much out of control yet.  I had restrained myself in that these things would only be a “weekend escape” for me.  I began to reason that if doctors could pump me full of drugs, theoretically but unsuccessfully trying to “help” me feel better, then why the hell couldn’t I use some drugs that I acquired on my own?  After all the drugs I acquired actually helped me feel better, unlike the 30 or so different prescription drugs I had been prescribed over the years of my life.  If I could be their guinea pig for over a decade now then fuck it.  I could do no worse self-medicating.  I didn’t see a “worse” than this in my life.  I was a truly miserable and angry person inside and out, fits of rage and frustration coupled with never ending thoughts of misery, it was a truly wonder I had not committed suicide.  My hole was so dark I no longer cared about what was right or wrong.  All that mattered was escaping the 24/7 torture that had long been my life.
	One day a friend mentioned something about getting high on pain medications.  I thought about it and realized my father has pain medications.  Would he miss a few?  Not likely, so I went for it.  Using Oxycontin started out as my new “weekend escape”.  It was the best thing in the world.  The only way I could describe it was “I felt like god” when I was using.  I had started out just swallowing them like anyone would but soon graduated to crushing and snorting them.  I was soon to turn 18 and my life was unravelling rapidly but I could not see reality from behind my drug clouded eyes.  All I knew was that I found an escape from the torture, I didn’t think I was hurting anyone and so why not?  My father had been taking less than his prescribed dose so I got away with taking his pills for a while.  At this point I had become such a “bad” kid that I was expelled from high school after racking up 300+ hours of detention (which I refused to attend) and numerous suspensions.  I was now <mark>forced</mark> to get my GED through an accelerated program that would allow me to obtain the diploma while I was still 17.  I had done a good job of hiding my drug use thus far, my parents had no idea.  In fact nobody in my family had a clue, everyone saw this as another phase in my fucked up life.  Drugs?  They didn’t think I needed drugs to fuck up like this.  Doing poorly in anything that had an authority, especially school was just the story of my life.  I somehow managed to get my shit together for a brief while and get my GED.  Then all of a sudden I was going off to college.  Going away to college? Fuck that was probably the worst idea yet.  There was no way in hell I would make new friends, I was to socially awkward.  I feared meeting new people possibly more than anything else.  College did not last long.  I didn’t make it through the first semester.  So fucking miserable I was driving 350 miles each way on the weekends just to be home and see my friends, the few I had.  This is when I started drinking, smoking and using pills again.  Before I knew it I was using and dealing.  I may have had more “friends” than when I was younger but I also had enemies all over town.  No longer tolerating the bullshit people felt they had to throw at me, I was getting into fights often.  One night things got out of hand, a kid who had been trying to tempt me into fighting him for weeks was about to have his dream come true.  I exploded one late night, before I even knew what was going on I found myself having beating the shit out of this kid.  He may have been half my size but I had given him too many opportunities to walk away, even after literally spitting in my face and throwing punches at me.  I knew if we were to fight it would not end well for anyone so I had refrained as long as I could.  One can only be shit on for so long until they break and I had just been broken.  His punches did not faze me and I quickly took him to the ground in the street.  He refused to back down and I refused to give him anymore free passes.  Eventually I got tired of his unwillingness to stop, it was time somebody learned a lesson.  He was lying on his back and I was on top of him, enough was enough so in my uncontrollable fit of rage I grabbed him by his hair, lifted his head high off the ground and proceeded to smash his head into the curb.  It only took one shot, this fight was now over.  His eyes rolled back into his head and his body went limp.  Blood was pouring out from the back of his skull.  Having just witnessed this my friends rushed over and separated me from him, fearing that if I had not already killed him, any further <mark>blow</mark>s would surely seal the deal.  Nobody wanted to be involved in this now.  I was fortunate that my friends got me out of their before the police arrived and again fortunate that this kid survived but was unwilling to talk.  He came from what I then considered a silly ass Italian “want to be tough guy” family, however his two older brothers quickly found out I had been the one who nearly killed their little brother and before I knew it the pursuit was on.   What was I to do?  Surely I would be out numbered when they caught up with me, and this was not something that the influence of my social savvy older brother could fix.  I was now 18 and completely out of control so what else to do?  Buy a gun?  You’re damn right I did.  The next day I armed myself with a shotgun and 150 rounds of buckshot.  If people wanted to continue to fuck with me, I was now prepared to kill them without hesitation.  I was a lost soul and absolutely out of control.  I now had no reservations about <mark>blow</mark>ing someone’s fucking head off.  If you really wanted to fuck with me, I was 100% prepared to fucking kill your stupid ass.
The Oxycontin abuse was catching up with me.  I now had a serious habit and a serious addiction that if left unfulfilled would leave me quite sick.  Fortunately for me, I had no problem with the supply of pills.  My parents were catching on though.  I know they did not want to believe their son had become such a monster, I didn’t want to believe it myself but one can only hide the truth for so long.  One day I had gone out, leaving my gun in my closet next to the four cannabis plants I had growing at the time.  Little did I know the pot was about to boil over.
I returned home that evening, went to my room and discovered my gun was missing and my plants were gone.  Obviously my parents had figured me out but to what extent?  They felt it a good idea to act as if nothing had happened, waiting for me to approach them from my now extremely uncomfortable position.  We all ignored it until the tension finally snapped.  So they knew about the gun, they knew about the grow, but worst of all they knew I was stealing my father’s pills.  By now at least a year had passed since I began taking them and while never caught in the act it was clear my mother was not the culprit.  The only other person in the house was me.  I would wait until they were asleep, sneak in their room and take what I pleased right In front of their faces.  What a piece of shit I had become.

Why Are We Turning Against Our Own While Supporting Nations We&#x27;ve Never Known?</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Many pro-Palestinian organizations have recently called for a boycott of Tata products, particularly Zudio, due to Tata&#x27;s alleged association with Israel. Latest protest was at Calicut, Kerala. At the same time, it&#x27;s widely known that Israeli drones played a significant role in the recent conflict by delivering heavy <mark>blow</mark>s to the opposing forces.

This raises a serious question: if a full-scale war were to break out and Israel officially joined the fight against these groups, would these same organizations continue to boycott Israel? It&#x27;s hard to understand how people can support a foreign nation they’ve likely never even visited, while choosing to boycott a brand like Tata—an Indian company that has been one of the pillars of this nation’s growth and development.

If religion is truly the basis for this support, what happens if followers of every other religion in India—Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Hindus—begin to support countries where their religion is in the majority instead of supporting their own homeland? Such a mindset undermines the very foundation of India, which has always stood strong on the principle of &quot;Unity in Diversity.&quot;

Frankly, this kind of behavior raises doubts about the intent behind these actions. One can&#x27;t help but wonder if certain groups within the country are being funded or influenced by external forces with the aim of creating internal disturbances.

            <div class="content collapsed">Paliwal, Avinash. “Losing the Peace: Famine, Coup, and Countercoup in Bangladesh.” *India’s Near East: A New History*, Penguin Books, 2024, pp. 212-214.

But India continued to make the same mistakes. Officials reaffirmed their faith in India’s central aims in Bangladesh after 1975: prevent anti-Indian powers from using Bangladesh as an ops base against India, and prevent Hindu exodus. But the prescription was more of the same, i.e. to have a ‘friendly government’ in Dacca and forge ‘mutually advantageous links’ as Bangladesh became ‘more and more involved with India’. It was an acknowledgement that India still viewed Bangladesh as a dependency.

Why was there a difference between theory and practice? This is where India’s hegemonic ambitions and domestic insecurities come into view. The self-critical note offered a patronising psychological analysis of Bangladesh. First, ‘intense anti-India and anti-Hindu propaganda’ before 1971 left a ‘residue’ in the subconscious Muslim minds. Second, the disconnect between East Pakistan and India meant that Bangladeshis didn’t understand India and believed all propaganda (despite the report acknowledging that Bangladeshi charges against India after 1971 were accurate). Third, being a small new nation, Bangladesh had a ‘natural sense of inferiority, which every ‘aided’ nation resents’.

The note advocated a ‘mature’ long-term approach that aimed to strengthen pro-India lobbies, and sought a ‘cultural conquest’ that would expose Bangladeshis to Indian secularism and ally with the Soviets to forestall the US-China-Pakistan nexus. Anything that undermined India’s ‘unipolarity in Bangladesh’ in the long term must be avoided. But in the near future, New Delhi had to convince Zia not to confront India. On 2 January 1976, R&amp;AW Joint Secretary N Framji Suntook, who became chief of R&amp;AW a year later, authored a top-secret note on the strengths and weaknesses of the Bangladeshi government and the opposition groups such as the JSD and Kader Bahini. He noted that ‘emphasis on Islamic identity by the majority community’ coupled with the rise of China and Pakistan was bad for India. Suntook listed what Pakistan’s mission would do in Bangladesh and how India must ‘counteract’.

In R&amp;AW’s reading, Pakistan was planning to post 100–150 personnel in Dacca and open a consulate in Chittagong. Such a footprint would allow the ISI to exploit the ‘old boys network’, and have pervasive influence in Bangladeshi ministries. It risked exposing India’s problems with Bangladesh ‘from A to Z’ making Pakistan the ‘invisible third party exercising influence’ in bilateral negotiations on boundary settlement and water sharing. Pakistan could infiltrate Bangladeshi media and educational institutions to foment pro-Islamic, pro-Pakistani feelings, and encourage anti-India and anti-Hindu sentiments.

Once things started going their way, ‘Pakistan may promote the idea of a confederation’ with Bangladesh. Why? Because Bhutto viewed Bangladesh’s proximity to India’s northeast as a strategic advantage and believed this region ‘had the potential of developing into another Viet Nam’. True to style, Bhutto met with Mizo rebel leader Laldenga in 1973 to reassess Pakistan’s support after the 1971 setback. Suntook believed that Pakistan would also support Naxalites and fuel disaffection against India in Nepal. Zia’s conservative nationalism, viewed from this perspective, was anathema.

Suntook recommended an aggressive campaign. For starters, India needed to broaden and deepen its intelligence gathering system to track Pakistani operations. Such measures included cross-governmental coordination with the State Trading Corporation, Aid, Shipping, Coal Board, and so on who dealt with Bangladesh. Suntook proposed maintaining ‘steady pressure’ on Dacca about Pakistani activities, and to ‘make it clear to the leaders of Bengla Desh that their alignment with Pakistan would pose a threat to our security and would not be acceptable beyond a point’. Close cultural ties that ‘keep the memories of the freedom struggle’ and the ‘atrocities committed by Pakistan alive’ were also recommended. For this, the scale of India’s cultural activities needed to be on a scale ‘comparable to that of the Americans and the Russians in India’.

But there was a sharper edge to R&amp;AW’s strategy. After mapping out the who’s who that could target Zia’, Suntook recommended all ‘feasible measures’ to ‘soften up areas which are contiguous to Indian territories’. In security parlance, this meant arming the Shanti and Kader Bahinis, and AL rebels such as Suttar (known to R&amp;AW as ‘Chittu babu’).

Then came Suntook’s final <mark>blow</mark>:

&gt;…serious thought should be given to the idea of providing strong support to anti-Pakistani activities in NWFP, and Baluchistan now being carried on from bases in Afghanistan. To relieve Pakistani pressure on India through Bengla Desh, it may be necessary to intensify pressure on Pakistan through Afghanistan to the extent that it is feasible to do so.

Suntook’s recommendations echoed bureaucratic consensus and became policy until Gandhi lost power in March 1977. Zia came to believe that R&amp;AW was after his life. After coming to power, he prevented an Indian intervention by not declaring Bangladesh an Islamic republic. But he faced intense pressure by anti-regime elements, all of whom received covert Indian support. Officially, India communicated to the US that it was ‘calm and cool’ about Bangladesh and acknowledged that large-scale persecution of Hindus was not happening. Unofficially, it pressured Zia.

US intelligence noted that the BSF opened more training camps after November 1975 for anti-Zia rebels. By August 1976, India helped an estimated ‘two to three thousand’ such elements to cross over into Bangladesh. Cross-border violence by India-trained rebels became routine in 1976. Such kinetic support to the Shanti Bahni was accompanied by relocation of Chakma refugees to Arunachal Pradesh. To augment infiltration, the BSF launched a big operation on 20 April 1976 at the Bandarkata border post in Mymensingh. Sylhet and the Meghalaya-Tangail/Mymensigh border areas were specific points where India increased pressure. Many of these India-trained ‘miscreants’ created ‘instability’ with the ‘ultimate objective of overthrowing the existing government’.

Certain members of the Gono Bahini, the JSD’s armed wing, joined the Kader Bahini. By May 1976, India had trained the first batch of Shanti Bahini fighters in Dehradun and Haflong, Assam. By 1979, 700 Chakma fighters received training and most of the 150,000 displaced Chakmas were relocated. Just before Gandhi lost power, R&amp;AW asked the Shanti Bahini for a ‘big push forward’ with the promise of expanding its cadre to 15,000. For his part, Suttar intensified the Bangabhumi movement for a separate Hindu state in Bangladesh. Little understood, the Bangabhumi movement resonated with Bangladeshi Hindus. ‘Our relationship with Suttar was very benign’ and the operational understanding ‘deep’ says an Indian intelligence officer with knowledge of these matters.

            <div class="content collapsed">So I have some side of my family (we are gujurati) that firmly believe that muslims are trying to &quot;take over india&quot; through <mark>forced</mark> conversions.

This came up because I was talking about elon is an insane psycho(this side of my family thinks he&#x27;s a hero, lol) who believes in the great replacement theory, that democrats is letting in immigrants(illegal or otherwise) to replace white people. 

My family&#x27;s response to this was that this is what is happening in india....I honestly thought they were kidding at first. This side of my family is very well educated, so I thought I could bring up the decline in muslim immigration to India, I thought I could bring up the fact that india is still 80% Hindu (2011 census)

But as per usual they said I have no idea what I am talking about and that I should stick to american politics (ironic, because that&#x27;s what I was initially talking about) while talking to me like a child (i&#x27;m in my early 30s, lol)


Is this line of thinking...is it a common idea in India, do people really believe in conspiracies like this? I am going through a lot of thoughts right now, as I got older, a lot of these radical ideas started to &quot;seep out&quot; from them. It gets to the point where I do not like talking about politics or anything around them. Politics is important to me and I take a lot of pride in being able to discuss things with people, ESPECIALLY when they disagree with me. I think it&#x27;s important to listen to people even if they don&#x27;t share your views, if anything it&#x27;s more important to do so.

Dunno, maybe I am just disappointed. Not sure how to react to any of this. Some of the things I have heard from family, and even in-laws who moved from India to the US....just <mark>blow</mark>s my mind really.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">
Some of the promises they have made in their manifesto seem like the final <mark>blow</mark> and nail in the coffin to Indian Democracy.

**1. One nation one election, under the garb of saving costs will deal a deathly <mark>blow</mark> to our Democracy which is already in ICU.**

&gt;1. Dilution of Regional Issues: State elections often focus on specific regional concerns, and combining them with national elections could overshadow these crucial matters

&gt;2. Reduced Accountability: Longer election cycles may reduce the frequency at which voters can hold governments accountable for their actions, potentially leading to complacency among elected representatives

&gt;&gt;&gt;*1. When elections are staggered and spread across, it atleast keeps the national/multi-state parties on their toes and keeps them somewhat accountable and also allows for other states’ issues/national issues to affect state elections.*

&gt;&gt;&gt;2.*For example : Say a massive farmers protest occurs in Delhi and their ill treatment might influence voting decision of farmers in local states that are going to elections in the following months or a big corruption scandal that got exposed nationally might affect the same party’s prospects in the local elections.*

&gt;&gt;3. The constitutional challenges of &quot;One Nation One Election&quot; intensify if a government is dissolved or dismissed prematurely. This scenario raises complex issues regarding synchronizing the terms of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, requiring amendments to Articles 83, 85, 172, 174, and 356 of the Constitution. The need to manage breaks due to dissolution, President&#x27;s Rule, or hung assemblies poses significant hurdles, potentially undermining India&#x27;s federal structure. Without proper synchronization and constitutional amendments, the proposal risks facing legal and structural criticisms, impacting the democratic fabric of the country.

2.**UCC**

&gt;1. UCC and Some sections of the new criminal laws are outright anti people and snatch away our freedoms. Like UCC requiring live in relationships registration and requiring scrutiny/consent from a police station guy, maintaining registry, and then after breakup
 
&gt;&gt;2. **Anti-Woman and Anti-Democratic (Anti-Liberty and State interference in personal lives):** The UCC is seen as anti-woman, anti-democratic, and draconian. It restricts adult women&#x27;s sexual autonomy, allows for moral policing, and interferes in consensual relationships, including marriage and divorce

&gt;3.**Criminalization and Penalties**: The UCC is criticized for its heavy focus on penalties and punishment, creating a legal environment that criminalizes personal choices and relationships.

&gt;4 **Exclusion of Tribes and Targeting Minorities**: Critics highlight the exclusion of Scheduled Tribes (STs) from the UCC and its perceived targeting of Muslims. The law is viewed as a &quot;Hindu Code&quot; that imposes cultural values on all citizens, especially minorities

&gt; 5.**Registration of Live-In Relationships**: Mandatory registration of live-in relationships is seen as intrusive, violating individual autonomy, and potentially leading to marital disputes, interference from authorities, and societal scrutiny

&gt;6. **Selective Application and Double Standards:** Critics argue that the UCC&#x27;s selective application, exemptions for certain communities, and exclusion of tribal and minority groups undermine the law&#x27;s claim to uniformity and equality

&gt;7. These criticisms collectively paint a picture of a UCC in Uttarakhand that is perceived as regressive, discriminatory, and detrimental to personal freedoms, especially in the context of relationships and breakups.

**And then if BJP wins this time with almost similar results as 2019 and in worst case if it gains more seats, then it reinforces BJP’s mindset , attitude and gives them bold confidence that what they are doing does not matter to people**

3. Manipur does not matter. They can get away with gross incompetence.
   
&gt;1. *In any half decent democracy, this alone would be enough for a president’s rule to be en<mark>forced</mark> and state govt dismissed and army brought in.*

4.**Protests mean nothing to this govt and are dealt with force.**

&gt;*1. Farmers protest took over a year with 700+ deaths and we all saw how the recent farmer protests were treated almost as an infiltration into the country with nails,spikes, blockages etc*

&gt;2.*Wrestlers protest and nothing happened*

&gt;*3. Ladakh Protest*

&gt;4. Not attending and not even acknowledging the protests and meeting the agitated is basic responsibility of a govt. Whether the demands are reasonable/feasible/logical or not is secondary. If govt believes they are unreasonable then govt should atleast meet them and explain and sort things out.*

5. Extreme Misuse of agencies does not matter.

6. Press freedom does not matter. PM holding an open press conference and being held accountable does not matter. PM coming to the the parliament and answering questions does not matter.

7. Passing bills without any discussion or debate does not matter

8. Suspending MPs for raising their voice does not matter, Mass suspension also does not matter

9. Use of governors to interfere in state govts functioning does not matter

10. Washing machine politics does not matter. People dont care

11. Communalism and Hate speech does not matter

12. Toppling govts doesnt matter

13. Election Commission and its discharge of constitutional duties does not matter

14. Using PMLA and UAPA on civil society activists does not matter

15. Electoral bonds does not matter
16. Covid mishandling does not matter

17. Weakening of democracy does not matter. CAG / RTI is being diluted..

18. Heck, rejecting opposition candidates’ nominations, forcing them to withdraw and win uncontested without even a single vote being cast like it happened in Indore,Surat and In Arunachal Pradesh, 10 BJP MLAs have been declared elected unopposed (they have simultaneous assembly and lok sabha elections)

19. I also have a distant fear that once NRC is brought in and implemented, Muslims might be particularly at the receiving end and a significant number of them might be declared as infiltrators. I dont know why I feel this , but I feel this more so after PM gave a blatant hate speech saying Muslims are those who have more kids and are infiltrators…

20. Delimitation if not done properly will make the south politically irrelevant because UP + Bihar will have equal political influence of that of the entire south.

21. Add above delimitation and the way they undermine Rajya Sabha by bypassing bills by introducing them as money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, further reduces the states political power in the federal structure.

The list is endless and these are some of the major things that come to my mind and are certainly gloomy.

I seriously don’t have energy to fight the whataboutery and falsehoods spread about the INDIA Alliance..

Remember in India politics is not who is good and better than the other but rather who is the lesser evil…and it’s clear who the lesser evil is.

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. 

Its highly likely that BJP will return to power for 3rd term on their own. As much as I don’t want BJP to return , I’m starting to lose hope and I’m starting to believe in what Bhakts say , “Ayega toh modi hi” ,

So be mentally prepared (atleast I am)… Good luck and best wishes to all of us. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This unbelievable true story is a testimonial to a human’s will. A will to move a mountain, literally

His tragic &amp; inspirational story gives hope that if a person with no means, no money, and no support can challenge a mountain, what is really there to stop you?

The Tale Begins : Born to a poor labourers family in 1934, the story took shape in 1956 when a young man named Dashrath Manjhi, a resident of village Gahlaur [District Gaya, State of Bihar, India] was married off to a girl named Falguni Devi as per ancestral traditions. The marriage at that time was a pledge given in word only, something that would realize several years later when Dashrath Manjhi returned from the dark coal mines of Dhanbad now perfected as a coal miner. Now in his adulthood, he innocently fell for Falguni Devi, only to realize that she was his childhood bride.

The 1st Challenge : His yet to be father-in-law would not allow for a union as he was jobless. A drive to earn a livelihood &amp; start a new life with his childhood “sweetheart” was now made possible and they had their first son in the late 50’s and Falguni Devi became pregnant again in 1960.

Tragedy Strikes : The Village, Gahlaur, where Dashrath Manjhi lived was cordoned off by a hillock which made traversing for local villagers a cyclic struggle. Waiting for homemade lunch one day while at his work-field he was informed that his wife tripped while trying to cross the hillock and was wounded fatally. An attending physician at a hospital many miles away declared her lifeless when she bloodied body was carried here.

Path of retribution : A shattered man now who lost his love determined that none should have to endure what they did. He cursed the hillock and decided single-handedly to carve a path through it, <mark>blow</mark> by <mark>blow</mark>, stone by stone, inch by inch till hillock surrendered! Discovering his madness the villagers, his father-in-law opposed &amp; ridiculed him. He picked up his hammer &amp; chisels and started hammering away his journey into the void.

What Pursued : Many years passed, droughts came and went which <mark>forced</mark> villagers to evacuate for food scarcity &amp; water but Dashrath Manjhi, unshaken, unmoved &amp; unaltered carried on with little food, little or no water and sometimes survived on edible leaves. He kept on hitting, <mark>blow</mark>ing away the boulders which once were impermeable.

15Years Later : an opportunity in National Emergency? . Encouraged by a Journalist and a few people to carry on, Dashrath Manjhi got an opportunity to talk &amp; get photographed with then Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi at one of her rallies in Bihar. The story goes that the stage where Smt. Indira Gandhi was addressing her campaign collapsed and Dashrath Manjhi with a few others came to support this crumbling structure which influenced their conversation/ photograph.

Mocked &amp; Lathicharged! : As politicians &amp; opportunists do, they guarantee &amp; crowds follow. Dashrath Manjhi too got persuaded to reach out to the powers that be and secure government funding for his cause. When the district government officials pocketed-in on the approved grants &amp; mocked him, he set sail to New Delhi to confront the Prime Minister himself about the situation. With insufficient money to travel by train, he was thrown off only to travel by foot to New Delhi. When he finally reached the gates at Rajpath carrying a photograph of himself with the Prime-minister of India, he was mocked &amp; lathicharged away.

Dreams now shattered, was there hope? : He returned heartbroken to his village only to continue ploughing, this time now accompanied by a few brave souls. The local officials halted and got him arrested for defying an order not to continue his work. The said journalist organized a protest and got him released soon. 22 years after he started, Dashrath Manjhi’s earth-shattering efforts took shape when in 1982 the government finally was roped in to make a proper road on the carved rough path. This champion of hope had blasted through rock, rubble, dust and single-handedly carved out a 360-feet-long, 30-feet-high and 30-feet-wide passage through the hillock. He not only created a difference in the lives of villagers by shortening the 55 km distance into 15 km, he showed that no dream or mountain is large enough to conquer.

Afterlife :In 2006, Dashrath Manjhi’s name was proposed for the fourth highest civilian award in the social service sector in India, the Padma Shri Award.

In 2007, at age 73, Dashrath Manjhi passed away and the government of Bihar recognized a state funeral to him.

A documentary, 3 Indian movies, and few roads were made to honour his efforts &amp; memory. Following this, a hospital, a school, a road and even a police station were constructed in his village.

This story of a legend, a simple man, ends with awe-inspiring moments and teaches us about patience, willpower and facing your weakness head-on.

            <div class="content collapsed">I (F 18) met my ex best friend (we’ll call her laura for privacy reasons) in grade 2. pretty normal for elementary friendships. we werent too close at the start but our friendship grew pretty fast. in grade three it was (for reasons unknown) very popular to talk abt s3x and how it worked and what people did during s3x. Laura picked up on this information and tried corrupting me with it. eventually we started having sleepovers quite frequently and during these sleepovers she would try and do things to me while we were alone in my room. usually at night. id always push her off or tell her to stop- but eventually she would overpower me (sit on me or hold me down) while she touched my body. 

now you may be thinking: “why didnt you just tell an adult?”. i totally should have. but she had made a threats saying she would twist the story and make sure no one spoke to me again. she did this to me for 4 years. during the middle of grade 7, she decided she would spread a horrible rumour about me. it started by her telling her mother that i was hurting her physically at school (once it got out and everyone knew about it- none of my friends believed her because they were always with us when we all hung out and had never seen me hurt her in anyway. everyone else believed her lies though). 

her mother (note: she is on the school board and was in contact with the staff at the elementary school that Laura and i both went to) started taking control of the “situation”. i was forbidden from seeing Laura and she had called the school to inform them of the situation. this resulted in me being moved to a separate room all by myself. the principal would put me in this room and leave me alone for the entire school day. i wouldnt learn anything and he wouldn’t let me leave because (these are his words) he didnt trust me enough to come back. i couldnt leave to get my lunch, i couldnt use the restroom. NOTHING. he would keep me late after school and make me write apology letters to Laura apologizing about what id allegedly done. he would keep me there so late that i would miss the bus and be <mark>forced</mark> to walk home in -30 to -40 degree weather. 

obviously my parents were not okay with this so they stepped in. my mother and i went to speak with her mother about what exactly is going on and why i am being treated this way. she replied saying i was a bad person and a terrible influence. (keep in mind that when Laura and i were friends we played minecraft and lego friends.) my mother obviously stood up for me and at the time i had been very depressed that id stopped eating and was hurting myself so she brought up how Laura’s actions and her mothers actions have ruined my mental health as well as my chance at a good education because i was no longer allowed in the classroom. some rude words were exchanged from both my mother and Laura’s mother and we left. 

I finished the rest of grade 7 with these horrible conditions but thankfully Laura had decided to move schools and finish elementary at a different school than me. grade 8 was fabulous and i never had to go to the principals office once and had no issues with friends. halfway through- quarantine happened and i moved houses and didnt hear anything about her. grade 9 started and she had picked the same highschool as i did and i still never associated with her but she was still telling people i hurt her and was harassing her. eventually i got called down to the counsellors office. in the counsellors office, they explained that Laura had said that I was making her uncomfortable, which made no sense because I hadn’t been associating myself with her, stood around her or spoken to her in an entire year. 

my mother sent a email to the school counselor, and he replied, saying he didn’t want to bring up anything from the past, but the whole reason that I was in that office was because of stuff from the past, because I most certainly wasn’t doing anything to her at that point considering I wasn’t associating myself with her at all. anyways my mother contacted the office to let them know my side of the story to which they reply saying they arent trying to bring up things from the past which doesn’t make sense since the whole situation IS in the past. after a while they stopped calling me into the office at all and Laura was still getting called in regularly. her mother still being on the school board obviously gets herself involved then I’m back into the counsellors office. 

There’s more problems yada yada yada all that <mark>blow</mark>s over basically and people start seeing her lies about me being abusive and they noticed that it’s really her that’s being abusive because she makes threats to her friends to her family, she threatened to hit one of my friends in the head with a lock for a locker because she wouldn’t let her hit her vape and just crazy things. she started doing a lot of drugs and skipping school, skipping class and whenever she would be caught doing these things she would blame it on her brother who passed away like four years ago I mean yes understandable your grieving, but you can’t use him as an excuse for everything. 

so anyway her mother saying that I am a bad influence really didn’t make any sense considering when she was friends with me we were playing Minecraft and playing with lego friends and NOW shes addicted to drugs and is failing school. Word got out that she’s a liar and that she abuses people and she eventually got called out for skipping school and was sent to the office for all her absences and was kicked out of the school and sent to a special-needs school because she was not learning well at the one that she went to at the moment. So here I am 18 years old and graduating high school with honours and she won’t graduate for another two years because of how much she missed.. Let’s just say she got what she deserved.🤷🏻‍♀️</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This is the third time I&#x27;ve tried to write in the last week. The first time, I deleted everything, maybe 8 paragraphs of bitching. The second time, I restarted my computer without saving (turns out it autosaved, but if I was that forgetful of it, was it really worth saving?). Now, I&#x27;m going to use some new echoing sentiments and see if they can bring the feeling home.
   
A first-class mage, out of mana, all-but totally defeated in battle, would continue to fight until the end.
   
I also saw Tony Robbins tell Theo Von to look around the room for every brown object, and then asked him to report on how many red things he saw. He then challenged Theo on how many things he instinctively tried to make fit into the &quot;red&quot; category that might have been close, but not quite right. It was a quick illustration to demonstrate how we filter in and out information based on what we want to see and reflexively justify or make excuses to help &quot;win&quot; in our perception of how much we noticed.
   
Writing helped teach me at more of an instinct level that my perception was infinitely incomplete. I write to express the &quot;drama&quot; or pain and negativity and catastrophic consequences of inattention and inaction. And then after each sentence, I&#x27;m presented with the choice to double down or refute. I draw *relative conclusions* based on how I&#x27;m choosing to express myself on the topic. I&#x27;m not convinced. I&#x27;m never all bad or all good. My motivations are often equally greedy and selfish as they are kind and patient. I think to be a wise or real human you have to be aware of that duality in as many moments as you can.
   
My life, or at least the narrative that feels most appropriate to try and capture it, changed in a fundamental way a few days ago. For the first time, I&#x27;m able to &quot;simply&quot; do my job without qualification. There&#x27;s still messy bits that I&#x27;m working to stabilize, but I&#x27;m not at the mercy of the forces I&#x27;ve been complaining about for years. I have breathing room to see if people I&#x27;ve hired raise even more funds or successfully net me grant money. I have enough to keep the credit card companies at bay. I just have to do what I do best, talk, and get in front of as many people as I can.
   
I&#x27;ve had big portions of my life where I&#x27;ve felt relatively &quot;free.&quot; Drug study money time where I was functionally retired for my 20s I wasn&#x27;t anchored by anything but my &quot;friends&#x27;&quot; ambivalence and too much reading about the world. I woke up and slept when I pleased. I had thousands in the bank. It obviously wasn&#x27;t what I aspired to be or have or I wouldn&#x27;t have taken on the thousand headaches related to building a more permanent living situation. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to breathe, but it&#x27;s a new kind of air.
   
One of the things I mentioned in those previous writing attempts was my aptitude for games like StarCraft. You start with the resources on the map. At different points in my life, I&#x27;ve made manifest what I wanted/needed when the resources were in place. Bills covered while in school? I built the next-level party environment. Cash upon graduating? Oh look, a coffee shop. Money saved from drug studies and/or working several jobs at once? I genuinely forget &quot;the struggle&quot; it&#x27;s been to get here typing this from my fort staring down the barrel of an endless list of projects or upgrades to make. You give me the instrument, or tool, or video game and I learn how to play it, if not better than you, better than most.
   
I&#x27;m a first-class mage. I keep fighting, even when I feel, acutely and constantly, at some proverbial end of my rope, existentially dreadful, and full of hatred for this, that, and the other thing. A condescending conversation can set me on something of a roller coaster, and then a surprise, like the donated money to get back to work, quickens the process to shuffle that one asshole into the gigantic pile of assholes making the same predictable mistakes that have set me off my whole life. My emotional response is routinely violated and proven wrong, so, I learn not to trust it. It goes both ways though, and you have to adjust your sense of &quot;happiness,&quot; which I think is miscalibrated in a lot of people.
   
I&#x27;m not unhappy. I&#x27;m also not particularly enthused or engaged by most things. I can watch most TV sped up because they aren&#x27;t saying anything interesting or new. I&#x27;m not &quot;shocked&quot; by the horrors reported in the news. I&#x27;m not so sheltered or impoverished to be brought to tears in some Dobby-esc way over what anyone treated appropriately could be initially excused for taking for granted. I know, just as an animal, I&#x27;m predisposed to sense the bad and danger. I know we&#x27;re negatively biased. Being aware of and incorporating that feels like* the project* of any conversation about addiction, mental health, or whether or not we find a place for ourselves in the world.
   
Part of the miscalibration in our sense of &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;belonging&quot; I think stems from bad incentives, bad expectations, and inexhaustible wells of denial and excuse making. I can identify literally dozens of &quot;failure&quot; points that would have prevented me from breathing this new air regarding my company. Some of them still currently exist and are being worked out. But what is &quot;failure&quot; to me? It&#x27;s a state that can change. It&#x27;s a point of learning. It&#x27;s the chance to ask new questions. It&#x27;s growth if you incorporate it. I need failure. I want to know what&#x27;s going to fail early and often, so I can fix it or work around it.
   
I look for failure points. I look for the pain and drama and inexcusable injustice. Then I see if there&#x27;s something I can personally do in how I orient myself towards that thing. I can&#x27;t &quot;fix&quot; every problem in the world, and am thousands of degrees away from practically influencing almost anything. I can always control how or whether I talk about it. I can&#x27;t fix inflation or &quot;the economy,&quot; but I can occupy a space that softens the <mark>blow</mark> of prices rising and greedy landlords. There&#x27;s gonna be one Dan Price for every 10,000 &quot;normal&quot; capitalist monsters, so I can pursue working conditions that attempt to bypass the machine, even while I&#x27;m working for it.
   
It&#x27;s hard. But it&#x27;s no harder than the stories I hear, by the hundreds, related to what people are struggling with as it pertains to their health, families, or finances. I&#x27;m in debt too. Not relative to my total assets or even half of what I tend to make every year, but my debt is servicing fun and growth. My debt is investing in crating a means to sustain my life and grow in my otherwise capacities if purely financial is off the table. I get more time. I get more chances to share with people ready to receive. I get to find the &quot;happy&quot; balance between what I&#x27;m working on, when I&#x27;m having fun, and when I&#x27;m navigating a fresh horror. It&#x27;s hard no matter what you&#x27;re doing in life. It feels orders of magnitude harder when you don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re suffering whatever it is you are or can&#x27;t find a matching fulfilling sense of order and meaning to press right up against the chaos.
   
It means something to me to be my brand of mouthy cunt. It means something to me to reflect on everything I&#x27;ve built, chaotically and constantly incomplete as they may be. It means something to me to go down swinging and find the &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;happy&quot; blog after I&#x27;ve bitched and moaned for hours. I&#x27;m a loser and a failure and then whatever comes next, all at once, every day, all the time. I don&#x27;t want to wildly swing in any direction and register the feeling as &quot;true&quot; in some too-compelling way.
   
This, and the spirit of those two unpublished blogs, is my 1,100th attempt to square my thoughts. What&#x27;s the last thing you&#x27;ve done 1,100 times? That&#x27;s how many times I&#x27;ve checked in on my worst impulses. It&#x27;s thousands of hours of breathing and patience in spite of a headache, racing heart, or impulse to self-destruct. It&#x27;s cheerleading for myself to maintain or succeed when I can&#x27;t find anyone to share my perspective enough to offer anything I find practically useful. In the 20 years I&#x27;ve been practicing, I&#x27;ve met a literal handful of people practically implicated and interested in the potential consequences of that practice. No matter the examples that get set. No matter the explanations offered. Most of us, most of the time, find our rut, and look for anything to keep us there.
   
I know how far and exotic my thoughts get with regard to what I wish to create. I know no incomplete fantasy snapshot is going to capture the work and pain and sacrifices. So, I always bring myself back here. How do I feel right now? Do I recognize the potential? Am I cautiously optimistic? Am I doing other things to celebrate my interests and values while &quot;the main thing(s)&quot; still sit in a more hazy or indeterminate state?
   
I haven&#x27;t slowed down going to shows. I&#x27;m still practicing my instruments, reading, playing video games, and planning or spending time with friends. I&#x27;ve got lines in the water for grants and fundraising. I just got off the phone with one of three potential someones to fix our licensed therapist hole. I&#x27;ve reached out and told my personal contacts we&#x27;re in business. I&#x27;m forging ahead, in literally every moment I can, to continue to craft an environment that doesn&#x27;t piss me off or confuse the fuck out of me in how negligently unaware it can manage to operate.
   
You can call it good or bad, but I realize it as working. Working for its own sake because the values contained can&#x27;t be better expressed or felt any other way. I literally feel better as I work to figure out what&#x27;s going on in my head. I cannot deny what I&#x27;ve created as I sit within my series of achieved goals. When I reflect on what I&#x27;ve written or overcome, that&#x27;s the new imprint on my mind. It transforms a story of venting or failure into a processing guidestone on the way to the next thing. My brain does not have that habit &quot;naturally.&quot; I am incomplete and begging to begin spiraling into hell if I made a determined effort to stop writing to just &quot;see how things go.&quot;
   
I already know that story. It happens in every moment I need to write, but haven&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s how I felt before I engaged the tool and did the work. It&#x27;s what I hear from others who are, to be sure, no more or less confused about life or their place in it than I am, but refuse to even attempt to organize it. Or they&#x27;ll try once or twice, &quot;Doing what I told them,&quot; when what I told them is that I&#x27;ve done it 1,100 times for 20 years. They heard what they wanted to hear to keep them exactly where they are.
   
I don&#x27;t want to be right here, and I want to be exactly here at the same time. I want a slightly warmer house with dedicated cord-managed rooms and high-end equipment. I want a sustainable nonprofit or business expressing my values that requires less of my presence over time. I want to be doing fun things, with friends, in any moment either of us choose, not thinking about the costs. I want to be telling other people&#x27;s stories of success and values through the work they&#x27;ve done that shame and humble the empty &quot;help&quot; and &quot;passion&quot; blind cunts profess from their entitled perches and insecure bubbles. I want so many things, in unashamed ways, and I know what must die in order to get them.
   
Until then, the ever-precarious story of inflaming and infusing incidents remains a work in progress.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">It&#x27;s been year since my country fallen victim of the russian agression, taking countless innocent lives for no good reason. And it&#x27;s good to see the world being more or less unitied against Russia instead of ignoring it like they did before.

But what makes me sad - are gloryfication of Ukraine, and especially our government by all mainstream media. And they are far from being &quot;good guys&quot;. The thing they are doing to the people, especially now, in times of war... most people from other countries don&#x27;t know about them, they think that if russians will be gone - we will be living in paradise. In reality, all the ukrainians are but a fuel for the government&#x27;s pockets. So here i wanted to share few things that you might now know, things that making me angry because I know that nobody will be punished for those actions - some from the facts that can be found online, others - from my personal experience. 

Please keep in mid that most of the things i write here have proofs. And originally this post were filled with links - almost any paragraph had at least one. But it&#x27;s getting deleted because of so many links, and i was adviced to post it without them. **So if anyone will want the proof to certain paragraph - just request them in the comments and i will give you a link to the video or news article about the subject**. 

Let&#x27;s start from widely know facts.

Our president pretends like he fights corruption. But in reality he is just replacing old corruptors with his own circle. An indepenant investigation called Pandora Papers has revealed that before becoming a president he offshored his riches in a tax evasion scheme: 

Notice how his spokeperson refused from any comments. They know that they are caught and just wanted the whole thing to cool down on it&#x27;s own, so people will forget and move on... as it was always done in this country. And if you think that he sold any of those riches to fund the war effort – then you have no idea what kind of personality you must have to gain any kind of power position in this country. Spoiler alert: not someone who would help others with their own funds.

Also, he was placing his friends all over the government. And (surprise!) people, who has been hired not because they are competent, but because they were friends of the president proved to be unfit for duty when real problems occured - that&#x27;s why he was <mark>forced</mark> to fire head of national security, who was also his childhood friend when damage that guy did became too much to look past:  But despite all the damage that guy did at that post – he was just fired, without any consequences for his actions. Meanwhile, they want to judge a mayor for treason because he released a captured russian pilot while the city was under russian occupation (and he didn’t really had any other choice). Maybe mayor should befriend president in his childhood, and this could be avoided?

For anyone interested, here is another article about making an illegal clown show just no prevent specific people from taking government posts as they should by law, so &quot;loyal&quot; people can be placed instead: 

We already have fresh corruption network established, and what you see in the news – is them getting rid of last remaining competition.

Our president also tried to get control over all the press in the country, because he is a tv star, expert in manipulating public opinion and knows how powerful this tool is 

Ironically, despite all those efforts only this war helped him to swap the image of corrupted oligarch&#x27;s tool to the &quot;tough and glorious protector&quot;... at least for the outside public and people who believe everything that’s said on the news, controlled by his office.

Also, our security forces who serve under Zelensky are involved in some very dark and shady things. Take this, for example: 

A guy were spying on russians for Ukraine, and thanks to his effort there were an ambush for russian paratroopers. Some say that this warning saved Kyiv. For that, he was taken by SBU right from the city streets, executed, and dumped back on the street. After that president named him a Hero of Ukraine, but refused to explain why ukrainian security service kidnaps and executes heroes without trial. This case basically says that any citizens can be taken and executed when government wants to, and they will not only avoid any responcibility, but also might just pretend that it never happened. And you can&#x27;t do anything about it... why? Well, because it&#x27;s not a legal country.

Yeah, you heared right. Laws here exist in theory, but they not always work in reality. For example, do you know the infamous act, that forbids all the men from age 18 to 60 from leaving the country? Well, it&#x27;s illegal. Here is lawyer explaining why, and there is more than one video on this subject -  Sadly, video is only in ukrainian language, but maybe if you google enough you can find the version for you language?

If this act is illegal, then why border guards are stopping people from leaving regardless? Well, as i said - this is not legal country. Laws do not work here as if they would work in US, for example, and they can just ignore the laws they personally don&#x27;t like. But there is another important reason for that... Bribing border guards and making fake id&#x27;s is a huge business right now, you can easily find information about any of those online - and this thing makes a lot of money for those involved in scheme. I think this is a main reason why you can&#x27;t force border guards to obey the law, and you can&#x27;t really sue them during the war... or ever.

Here is another video from same lawyer that tells you what will happen if you will ignore military conscription notice - 

Top comment there says how for 1k usd you can buy 2 month delay from conscriptiom, and for 5k usd - cross the border. The corruption isn&#x27;t even hidden here when it’s price tag is public knowledge, it&#x27;s part of our everyday lives - and laws are designed in a way to make ciziens miserable if they won&#x27;t pay.

By the way, if you will translate the comments under the videos above - you will get a pretty good picture about what real citizens of Ukraine think of our government - in case if you were wondering if i was the only one who are angry about this.

And problems with legality don&#x27;t end on this. Probably most of you heared the tales how people being rejected by military recruiters because there are too many volounteers on the front already? Well, here is a bit of reality for you, one of the most rectent videos of &quot;mobilisation&quot; - people are being surrounded and dragged to the military offices right from the streets 

And i also experienced similar thing, with multiple violations of my rights. Bunch of soldiers with guns surrounded me on the street and demanded documents (illegal, only police can do that), threatening violence if i will not comply. After that they started writing me a conscription notice (illegal to do on the spot, they need to pre-write it). When i said that it is pointless, since i am disabled, and disabled people can&#x27;t be recruited without their consent - they just laughed and proceeded to write it, saying that &quot;if they want, they will recruit anyone&quot;.

So i gathered all the necessary documents confirming my disability, but got very sick, so i asked my mother to deliver them for me (because if i fail to do that in time, they will fine me). Before doing that i consulted with lawyers and all lawyers said that it&#x27;s perfectly fine to deliver pack of documents via trusted person. She went to the mobilization center, where officer screamed and insulted her, saying that they don&#x27;t care about disability, only their doctors can decide if person disabled or not (illegal, of course), and threatening to call the police, but still accepted my documents (yet refused to give any validation).

I wondered why they put so much effort to drag in someone who clearly can&#x27;t be mobilized, and found out in various videos from lawyers on youtube. In short, the military officers hope that disabled people either don&#x27;t know their rights, and will agree to be mobilized, or will arrive in person, and will be mobilized against their will. You will say that they can go to the court? Yeah, they can, and they might even win the process. But the thing is that there is that by that time they will already be in the army, and there is no legal procedures that would allow for people to leave the army, even if they were put there illegally. So military recruiters right now are doing anything in their power to break laws and use force to recruit as many people as possible (in my city just a few weeks ago they started to appear in civillian clothes, ambushing bypassers to give them conscription notices – they constantly change places, hide in cars, and generally behave like a bounty hunters with zero respect for the citizens). And government are pretending that they don&#x27;t see any of this illegal stuff, even if it&#x27;s detainments are filmed on the streets (you can&#x27;t film inside the recruitment buildings, they made sure that you can&#x27;t record them threatening our lying to you). There is even a (unconfirmed) rumor that recruiters are being paid for every person they manage to recruit, that would explain why they being so aggressive. Internet is overflowing with videos of legal advices on how to minimize risks when dealing with this people, because this happens all over the country, not a single city respecting the laws. There is a systemic crimes being committed by authorities all over the country, and nobody will hold responsibility for that. What will happen when the war will be over, and all of this angry, deceived people (well, those who will survive) will return home with guns in hands? I don&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s a high probability of a new civil war here, but it&#x27;s clearly not zero. But you know who is invisible to military recruiters? Relatives or friends of the oligarchs and government officials. I don’t know any of them who would be recruited and sent to the front, let alone died there. Dying is the peasant’s job, and the rulers will reap the rewards. We all equal here, but those who are with money and connections are a bit more equal than the others.

And some of them already leaving the country with all what they took from said peasants: 

The government took all the male population of the country captive, reduced to slaves. Females can leave - because, somehow our government believes that being born with another set of genitals makes you a better human, deserving to live a life as you want to, instead of dying for your government on the battlefield. I saw many girls on dating websites changing their locations all the time - they are using this opportunity to travel around the world for free, since they are accommodated as refugees and all expences are paid for. Yeah, there are some real refugees who lost homes and loved ones, and who is having difficulties to find a place to stay in because of all this travelling ladies. Real refugees don&#x27;t start looking for partners on dating websites to have fun with right after they arrive in new country.

And the government not just holds males hostage, but also makes them pay. Prices on everything increased badly even before the war. And after war started and UAH crumbled - many things, even food doubled in price. But incomes remain unchanged. For example, my monthly disability pension is 2100 UAH. That&#x27;s around 60$. And also that&#x27;s 1\5 of minimal month income in the country (that does not matter though, since most people work for sums bellow minimal income anyway). And then heating mohtly price currently is between 1500 and 2000 uah (also it was around 200 uah many years ago, but then government decided that 1000% price raising will be a great idea). Total communal services - 2000-2600 UAH. So my entire income goes only to pay communals. Can i turn down heating? Of course no, i am the hostage, remember? It&#x27;s very easy to saw off the batteries from central line. But nobody will do that. By law you can only do this for entire house, and only if majority of appartments will agree. As you can guess, it&#x27;s not possible to get agreements from everyone, so it basicly leaves you in a situation when you have to pay for service that you have no need for (winters are warm atm) and cannot afford. If you can&#x27;t - communal service provider will just sue you and take your appartment as payment if you can&#x27;t afford to pay. You required to pay to the government no matter what, and they constantly making new forms of payments - for example, we have disabled hot water entierly and using only cold one to say money, but since latest year we still have to play for &quot;hot water service&quot;. Even if we don&#x27;t use a drop of it.

Back to the incomes... My mother worked her entire life fot the government. Her retirement pension is 3800 UAH, that&#x27;s about 1\3 of minimal income. She is <mark>forced</mark> to work or we won&#x27;t have anything to live at, even most basic stuff. And government does this on purpose, it&#x27;s a quiet genocide in hope that all the disabled and elderly people will die off either from being unable to pay for the medical treatment, or for essential stuff like food and housing.

Meanwhile, government lives very well. They try to keep their incomes a secret as much as they can, but there were cases when people found out the truth. For example, in 2020 in my city there were a semi-scandal where vice council received 165000 uah for 15 days of work: 

He got 54000 for &quot;solving a social and household problems&quot;, 54000 to &quot;keeping wellness&quot;, and the rest are mostly bonuses.

Just... bare in mind. Perfectly healthy young lad haves 165 000 so he can improve health and well-being for 15 days of work (when his normal income are supposed to be 7000, without premiums and stuff) just because he works as government official.

But elderly person who spend her entire life working on the government facility as regular worker (not official), and has tons of age-related health issues only deserves 3800 uah monthly pension. And when my mother will be not able to work anymore, she will probably die because of not being able to afford medicine that keeps her alive.

If you are a single mother in this country, you can expect up to a whooping 1000 uah help from the government:  Single fathers do not deserve even that.

I am disabled. Half of my health problems can&#x27;t be even diagnosed in government facilities, let alone healed. I can hardly walk and barely function, spending most days in bed. In employment center they just say &quot;no jobs for the likes of you, search yourself&quot;, then give you small sum of money for 3 months, and then they can’t do anything else. So 2100 uah is my entire month income right now. And the dude receives 78x time more than me just because he is in the gang called government. And he still works there, as many other people who received similar paycheks (also mentioned in the news article above).

And remember – those are merely official numbers. How much more they get from bribes, using their position to influence things, and other kinds of corruption? I would assume that much more. And for ordinary people there is no life here, only survival, so those guys can prosper. I know I have nothing to look forward to. I know I will die on the street when all my stuff will be taken for debts for the services that I do not need. Or they will throw me into the army regardless of my state. In any case my best hope right now is to die without much pain.

And if you think that corruption exist in small circles – think again. Half of the medics ask for &quot;donations&quot; before you can use their services. You can speed up most buerocracy with money. When I was operated in Kyiv, procedure should be free, but doctor said that &quot;for free it will be a free quality as well&quot;. And when mother gave him bribe, he left me disabled and said &quot;well, if you won’t be satisfied, we can do another one… when you will get the money&quot;. And nothing can be done because it’s unprovable.

My mother tried to fight the system once. She works at the government facility, sanatorium for sick kids. And her boss is… not a nice person. Among things she done was making employees crawl on the knees to beg forgiveness, or sending her old husband to territory defense forces in hope for easy cash (little did she knew that they will sent those untrained man to the frontlines at the start of the war, and now she has no husband anymore). But quite a long time ago employees were tired of things she pulls, like not paying them bonuses just because she wants to. And they wrote a collective complaint, but not to local authorities (who all have connections), but to the Kyiv directly. And some time after the boss received that complaint back, along with all the names of people who signed it. Then, their working conditions were changed to literall hell until most of them quit, and others begged for mercy, and were left, but at minimal payments. Now everyone who know about that are just afraid to do anything against her, because it will only result in punishment.

Now facility also hosts refugees. And takes stuff for them. And the top management always takes best of those stuff before giving some to the people (things so bad that even refugees do not take those). Also they have entire rooms filled with new stuff sent from other countries, locked and never used. Those just waiting for the war to end so they can be sold.

Administration of my city were stealing armored vests. Luckily, they got caught, but overall stuff they managed to steal was costing 12 million UAH:  And they were only caught because they were stupid enough to openly sell it at local e-market. Also, I saw all kind of things that look like foreign aid sold on those markets. For example, Starlink terminals.  Of course, there is always a chance that they were bought legally, but considering that price of Starlink internet is unaffordable for ordinary citizens, I have no idea why anyone would want to import them, and then sell on the internet market. The military won’t buy them because they are getting them for free anyway.

Perhaps, this all has something to do with the fact that the only humanitarian help I personally saw since the beginning of the war were 5 energy-saving lightbulbs, traded for the old ones by post office?

Did you ever heared attempts of our government portray us as a modern, European country? We don’t have progressive taxation. I think you know why, and why all the government (that has entry fee for presidential race, so only oligarchs or friends of oligarchs can join it) will be against it. We prosecute for weed, we don’t allow gay marriage, and girl from Kyiv being prosecuted for having an Onlyfans page, that is considered as &quot;porn distribution&quot;: 

And, do you know that despite year of being in war, the war is not officially declared not only by russians, but also by our government as well? Yet they create a lot of &quot;wartime laws &quot; regardless. Also our government has very &quot;cool&quot; scheme about the laws. When they want to accept a new law (for example, like the one that allowing to fire employees for taking sick days that were accepted in previous year), it takes a few days to do that (when laws that people need can boil for years in bureaucratic hell). But when they do not want to accept new law, president just… ignores it. Our constitution says that if Rada signs up the law, president has 15 days to sign up or deny it. But since the president wipes out with constitution – he currently has 29+ of such laws hanging in limbo, neither accepted or rejected:  But ignoring laws passed by the democratic structures just because he wants to is not a tyranny at all. And this laws can hang there forever, because there is no way to force president to made a decision.

Our government is good at imitating activity. No, don’t get me wrong – they can be active when their personal interests are at stake: for example, when the pipe, that transfers gas from Russia trough Ukraine were shut down during blackouts… it was powered back up in no time. Not hospitals, not shops, not schools, not homes of the citizens – the pipe that allows enemy to sell the resources. Out government had all the right to say &quot;the enemy disabled electricity in country, and since we value our citizen’s lives more than deals with the enemy, pipe will be powered back on only after every single citizen in the country will have power&quot;. They didn’t do that, because they care more about money than the citizens.

Instead, they call out to the international communities.

For example, they call to deport russians who trying to escape mobilization in Russia, travelling to other countries: Because what can go wrong with deporting people who then will be forcefully conscripted and sent to kill people from Ukraine? A genius plan indeed. We also deport people from Ukraine, for example, belarusians: 

Among them – activists who stoop up against corrupt government of Belarus and will be punished if they will enter homeland. Our government does not care. One activist were saved from such fate due to huge media resonance – she was about to be deported even despite volounteering to help victims of war in Ukraine. But how many of less lucky people were sent to the government who wants to jail or execute them?

But instead, we have calling for &quot;useful&quot; things like banning the video game made by russian developers, because it has ussr symbolics and setting. Clearly, that is the utmost danger for the citizens of Ukraine, and they must be liberated from it, no matter if they want it or not. Money that come from the russian pipe do not fund the war effort against us – it’s the video game that does.

Destroying books for the libraries, tearing down statues of russians who died before our country even started to exist – government is ready to do anything at all, except actually helping people in dark times. You probably want to ask a question - &quot;why don’t we hear about all of this? &quot;. There are a lot of various reasons – like many people from Ukraine not being able to speak english, or being unable to tell because they are recruited or dead. But there is also a thing called agenda. And right now the narrative that is being pushed is that Ukraine is amazing place to live, and would be paradise on Earth as soon as russians will be gone, and it’s all thanks to our brave, heroic government. Any other opinion labeled as russian propaganda. On r\ukraine I am banned for posting link to the article about Pandora Papers, on r\worldnews – for telling about that in the comment. In both cases mods didn’t care if it was true, they just wanted to silence the opinion that goes against the agenda they are trying to push.

Initially, i made this post on r\trueoffmychest, to tell the world that I am about to die, one way or another, and unable to do anything about that. That i am living without hope, and with the world either being blind to the issues i face every day, or trying to censor them. In responce, i got even more censorhip - my post were closed, with reasoning &quot;This not a place for pushing political agendas or spouting hate speech&quot;. Apparently, sharing real state of things in my country and telling a story about my life being worthless just because i was unlucky to be born in a wrong place - is considered as &quot;pushing agendas and hate speech&quot;. Or, perhaps, they just wanted to silence me, as anyone else who is afraid for truth to spill out. There is no sub i know on entire reddit (or like, entire internet) that would allow this post, every moderated place is a dictatorship that will not allow stories like mine to be heared, so now i am posting in r\self as a last resort for someone to even hear me. Maybe here censorhip will not be albe to shut me up.

I also met a lot of people who tried to explain me &quot;how things are really are in Ukraine&quot;, and when I asked them how do they know, I got replies like &quot;friend told me&quot;, or &quot;I have a wife from Ukraine, she moved out 10 years ago, but somehow knows everything better than you, a person who are there right now&quot;. All the people around the internet do not want the truth. They want and echo chamber about something that they want to believe in. And there is very few places when you can say how things really are without them trying to silence you.

The entire world thinks that we are fighting just russians, but in reality we are stuck between a rock and a hard place, when russians are open about wanting to rob and kill us, and our government secretly craves the same thing. Amid so many senseless deaths, suffering and grief, when people lose all hope to even have a future – government still wants to abuse them and profit from them, nothing but personal gains matters for them. And perhaps after we will deal with the common enemy this abscess will <mark>blow</mark> up and reveal all the rot for entire world. Or it will be silenced, as many other truths under the oppressive governments.

But at least you will know. I can&#x27;t change the situation, and my live was over the moment i was born here, but at least i can tell about this, so not only censored information will be present.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/iser7u/grass_is_greener/" target="_blank" class="title">Grass Is Greener</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I’m just kinda surging on some kind of goofy and motivated energy tonight. Today’s been a solid day. I got more work done on my job site, salvaged some bricks and roofing tiles. I ate a delicious meal I didn’t have to cook. I watched dope shows, and have been brought to tears laughing a few times watching some things online and in recalling instances from my day that struck me. Like, all days should have many of the elements of today. It’s spurred on by an incredibly mild tipsiness from 2 beers for which I’ve already come down and taken my preemptive pills to not wake up miserable.

I got to thinking. I still have to get my fliers out speaking to the shitty behavior of DCS. At the same time, I’ve reached out to a few people about sharing horror stories. Not one has emailed me yet, in spite of voiced enthusiasm. I know, I know, busy lives and not their fight and the world is ending in several concurrent ways. But in a very real light, no one really gives a shit. Whether the office was run in pristine fashion, or just acceptable enough to pass for human, the fact that it takes the disproportionately-likely-to-do-anything type of person to try and address it any kind of way is indicative of the larger cultural disposition.

Is that okay? I think “age and experience” are overburdened in persuading you that it is. I don’t want to move mountains. I want checks on power. I want accountability. You’re on board until you realized it would require you to write a page or two? Until the life you have outside of dealing with the exact same problems you voice independent of me looks like it’s more fun or easier to engage with? Even if I’ve grown to accept the kind of pace of “adults” and the “regular” world, I still cry foul. I’m, again, even willing to do all the work!

I think it takes a severe lack of appreciation for your agency and culpability before you start thinking about what the neighbor has. Just to <mark>blow</mark> a hole in the idiom, I don’t even like or want grass.You think the new job, new girlfriend, or new toy absolves you of the guilt or worry wrapped up in whatever’s on your mind. When confronted with an opportunity to address it proactively, you can do only two things. Nothing, or the work to process. Sometimes, I suspect for most actually, even just talking honestly about whatever that “thing” is for you is the processing. It’s no secret I can never get people to freely offer their words or thoughts. (Gotta flash the old smile and offer a shot.)

I try to run thought experiments. I try to put myself in others’ shoes and wonder what it would be like to fly a Trump flag. I wonder what I would have to have been through or not been born with to *deeply appreciate* my fast food job. I wonder how I would stay in certain kinds of relationships or allow for certain kinds of people to pollute my airspace. Every time, I remember I’m an aberration. I’m too critical. I write things like this parsing out details. Were I born in Nazi Germany or cousin-fuck Indiana, “me” would breakthrough as this process of not trying to be the dumb fucks around me. I don’t have that kind of empathy and understanding because I’ve never had it.

This causes me to remain fascinated by your experience. You have an infinite amount of information I can never access nor maybe even really understand. I can only hold up my disproportionate slant-rhyme kind of existence. Why yes! I can explain, I have been deeply in love! As you skim my blogs from high school you wonder what the fuck I could possibly mean. Oh I know what you mean! As we’re waxing about the importance of family and immutable bonds before you learn the calculus behind picking those worthy and capable over something like blood or the divinely designated.

I’m never going to get your experience though, am I? That’s what entertainers are for. To package the real experience into something with layers to unpack on television and fan forums or with a special license in comedy specials. People don’t talk or share what isn’t cultivated or safe. The memes are ready-made. The sentiment baked into their “engaging” platforms.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Aesop fable The Ant and The Grasshopper. Moreso, I’ve been thinking about the quality of “timelessness.” What can we expect to be true, like math, indefinitely? What moral truths or sets of behaviors? What expectations can you set and know beyond a shadow of a doubt, the “best” outcome probably doesn’t need to be in quotes despite whatever baggage may accompany it? If you’re unfamiliar, the ant spends the summer collecting food for the winter which he denies to the grasshopper who’s starving when winter comes after dancing all summer.

I feel I’m more ant than grasshopper. I feel the more my disposition flirts with being comfortable and smug as the world around me burns, I get the temptation to throw someone’s courted death in their face. Isn’t it all so obvious? Don’t you know what happens when you don’t face the reality of all you’ll need to eat to stay alive? Of course, I’m thinking of more than just food. You need good information to work with. You need standards to return to under duress. You need examples to act as guideposts to future explorers and moralizers.

The idea of nothing being a secret I find compelling. The only mysteries I really find entertaining are the yet-revealed plot points in a TV show or video game. I know there are things about the universe to discover and things we’ll probably never know. But, like, people? What we “should” be doing? The “secret” to happiness? The source of every miserable thought or wish I’ve had in life can be traced back to the same points. Dishonesty and isolation. When I refused to see my shared humanity, I refused to accept my shared responsibility. I, alone, could sit and spin on an endless array of dicks to fuck myself with.

We remain so convinced though. So close to the election, Trump flags are out in force. No one can tell us anything. Hell, even lived experience can’t crack a shell hardened by your own pretense! “That never happened to me!” That’s what makes me want to be incredibly selfish. Nothing I could say or do. Nothing I could offer. No dollar amount. No opportunity. No softening the edge of what cut me. No debate. No fancy package would make you open what was in front of you. Is it a binary situation though? That no one seems to answer when you knock, does that mean you’re no longer obligated to?

This is probably my central struggle. While I’m inclined to think you always and forever have to keep knocking, I don’t completely know why I’m inclined that way. I can habitually cite the good examples set by my dad and grandmother as having “saved” me the all-encompassing trauma of living with my mom, but that’s incomplete. I want to reap the rewards of my knowledge on how to take advantage of people, right? I want to trick you out of your resources. I want to intimidate you. I want to put out gag-worthy videos on social media and conjure my own kind of cult-like followers like Trump. It works, doesn’t it? What about our current level of existence doesn’t seem to suggest to you that it works? Do you just hope and pray Trump is as miserable as you imagine you’d be? Do you think every dollar paid to an “influencer” is like a little dagger in their back? Do you think any aging oil executive looks back at his life as a series of regrets?

Again I return to, I literally can’t imagine. I have no idea. If I were afforded the same opportunities, I’d come to the page, pick apart what the appeal of being Trump-like was, and find a timeless truth I’d have to choose to ignore. I like being a dick with the work ethic and evidence to back it up. I think a righteous bitch-slap is stronger than an insecure or angry one. If nothing else, I want to be a spiteful indignant cunt who shows you that well in spite of how absolutely horribly I’d love to treat you until the day I died, I managed to keep my shit together and create something that transcends. It isn’t about me. It’s about this sense in me that more people need to have. It’s about this habit of organization and accountability that lends itself to days where you can laugh, work, and drink, and expect to have more in service to the celebration instead of the escape.

Meanwhile, nobody gives a fuck, so I remain obligated to. I have to say I did what I could because fuck you. Fuck you in the way that’s fuck me if I behaved like you. Didn’t this start out sounding kinda light and fun? lol</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Where do I begin.. I suppose there is a lot in my post title to digest and wonder about.

Well the preteen experiences were with a teenage family friend. And I say they influenced because he along with others in my life (family and friends) used to bash gays or make fun of and use terms towards each other in a derogatory way. It was never ok to be gay the way they made it seem and act, not ok to like a guy, rude comments if guys kissed or anything in a movie, etc. And this teen let’s call him H was always a part of that and being one of the oldest in our friend circle he had more Influence and experience in peoples feelings. So it through me off when he made a move on me in a sexual manner. Him 16-17 me 11-12. Always one to bash and secretly he was gay or bi. It through me in a loop but I was also scared and pressured by his age and influence and threat of him telling others. 

It started with him verbally trying to get me into it by talking about hot women but him whipping out his cock and asking if I like it and want to touch it like the woman in a movie we were watching that had a sex scene. I denied and and denied and then was promised to be gifted things and persuaded in ways to my “benefit” even those it was clearly in his benefit. I eventually gave in. Hjs eventually we’re convinced into bjs with him receiving, and me trying to convince him reciprocated touch me and <mark>blow</mark> me as well because I was feeling it all be one way. He did but not in the same effort or manner or frequency. I didn’t enjoy it then, it was <mark>forced</mark> and convinced and coerced. It eventually made me hate him, hate myself, and hate that part and side of me. I denied that I was bi and that it was only do to what he convinced me to do. And what I was culturally and religiously brought up with my peers and siblings. The way I was <mark>forced</mark> to think and be was straight only and that gay or bi was wrong. I hated myself and those moments and him and it made me look back on that for years. 

Eventually I did have experiences with guys but mainly women but I still denied it and hated myself and him, I blamed him for influencing me but then I started to discover myself and maybe that is just me. Maybe I’m just bi, and maybe those experiences had a factor in that and maybe they didn’t. But I now self accept it and look at it as pleasure and a turn on and attraction to men and women rather then associating my bi side to the childhood experiences. 

Self acceptance is huge and is a strong step forward anyone in their life discovering being bi, gay, straight, etc. You need to be happy with who you are before you can bring your true self to be open with others. Don’t deny who you are and want to be. Learn, discover, experience life and yourself and love yourself. 

Not seeking acceptance or sympathy with my post just an experience to share and think about that may help others. I know childhood experiences can have lifelong experiences for people whether good, bad, traumatic, happy. It can live in your mind and influence you without you even knowing it. 

I just try to enjoy life and everything in it now. It’s too short to live denying feelings or experiences or pleasure and fun. Discover yourself and share it with the world.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m definitely not the type if person that should be typing this at all. I&#x27;ve been a liar, a thief, a cheat, and very dark person my entire life. I was attracted to it like I loved it. It made me feel whole and I&#x27;m not sure why. This story involves many ups and downs in my life. I&#x27;m not a scholar and I&#x27;m no one special I&#x27;m just a human being telling a story. With my own mind and my experience that I chose to share with you.

I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this to people who don&#x27;t fully understand the true meaning behind it. It&#x27;s like trying to show someone it is invisible a force that is unknown. Some people call this God, a creator, a deity, a intelligent being and some take as far as knowing the spirit doesn&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;m not religious in anyway, yet I believe in many religions. I was once and atheist, I thought I knew god didn&#x27;t exist. I was into physics and hated religion with a passion.

Those are just a short example of my background. I could be lying about this all completely. Yet, you can chose to believe it or not. These are all real experiences I&#x27;ve had and it is the life I live every moment I exist. I wish with every part of my being that at least one person can understand what I&#x27;m trying to say. Because, I&#x27;ve been talking my heart out with what seems like no success. The only success I can say I&#x27;ve had is my best friend and cousin.

This year 2018, me and him struggled with depression, break ups, and emotional pain. I was in a 3 year relationship with a close friend from high school and he was in a 7 year relationship. We depended on each other to get through the year. I wasn&#x27;t much help but I literally did everything I could even though I wanted to die every second. He never gave up on me and I never gave up him wanting me to succeed.

We are very close is what I&#x27;m trying to get at, best friends since ages 13. We spent almost every day together, sharing ideas playing videos games. We were best friends and we were blood. Something no one else can describe the amount of bond they gives someone. We are like complete mirrors. I didn&#x27;t like to talk, yet he loves to talk. I was always jealous and envied him. We are both Scorpios if that matters to anyone.

Fast forward through all the pain and living on the edge almost every night. He chose to never give up, I gave up many times. He took me with him to a life I couldn&#x27;t even imagine. I felt stuck in my current situation with my mind completely ruined and stuck as well. Using basically the last of his money and help from his mom. He bought a house. I helped him pack and move majority of his things. This is were my life started to change.

The first night after moving everything in his new house, he decided to trip on acid. We&#x27;ve tripped on mushrooms together a few times. I&#x27;ve never taken acid, but he has many times. I know how psychedelics lead to bad trips and such. I wasn&#x27;t really fully on the boat with the idea. Yet, I gave it no expectations and decided to take it anyway. This is about midnight on a Sunday, it was a new moon. If any of that matters. Yet, I think it has some sort of influence.

The idea was to setup the living room and watch Monty python quest for the holy grail. Something we&#x27;ve done many times before. It was a movie that we quoted and enjoyed together. We start setting everything up from the xbox to the TV and finding the movie in the boxes. We finally got everything setup and sat down to enjoy the ride. I&#x27;m not sure how much I took, but it sure was a ride I cant explain with words.

The come up to the trip was very intense and very happy and I was enjoying it a lot. There was a pattern on my entire vision, a pattern that was like the golden spiral or golden ration. I thought it was very amazing. I was staring at that pattern and I got sucked into a negative thought pattern that I could not escape.

I was sitting there, staring at the wall contemplating if I should live my life or not. It was in complete silence and i was hiding it from my cousin this entire time. I didn&#x27;t want him to know I didn&#x27;t want to live. I sat there talking to myself and just staring deep inside my actions. Then, I could hear my cousin talking. He was answering my questions I was asking myself. I could hide my emotions but not my words I was thinking.

That&#x27;s when i got the courage to show him how i felt. I turn to him, look him in the eyes. I conjure up all the negative emotions and thoughts about myself. It felt like a rock in the middle of my heart. A giant lump of anxiety and fear. I ask him with mouth if he can feel this. The first words I said in what felt like forever. He started crying and so did I. It was incredible he could literally feel how I felt about myself. I knew he could too. I&#x27;ve told him to point where I felt the pain months after.

This is when things started getting very weird. After that moment it was as if all my fears were gone and I felt free. I felt as if I was finally out of hell. I started getting super philosophical and religious. I didn&#x27;t understand any of the words coming out of my mouth. Yet, my subconscious grabbed onto it like gold. The thing though, all these thoughts I were getting were being answered or thought too with my cousin. All I had to do was THINK not even say and he would instantly answer. It was some form of telepathy or communication without words.

I didn&#x27;t understand any of this, as me being very logical and technical I didn&#x27;t want to believe what was happening. Yet, I enjoyed every moment of it and I learned so much stuff. We were getting onto subjects that people have written books about. For about an hour it&#x27;s about 3 am, we were talking in this way. He was laying on the floor and I was laying on the couch. It was a great time. The weirdest part has yet to come.

He sits down next to me, I start thinking to him like it&#x27;s natural. Then I become aware of what I was about to say. As if I knew what I was going to say before I said it. That is when I&#x27;m sitting there thinking and my thoughts are exiting his mouth. It shocked me, so I stopped doing it because I hide things from everyone. I felt as if I was speaking through him with my thoughts. Yet, he thought it was what I wanted I wanted to hear.

First about the next hour or two it&#x27;s almost 6 am at this point and the sun is up. We continue talking, yet it was just normal. The thing is though. We were doing stretches and just talking still. I never stretch and it felt amazing. It felt as if I was reliving ancient stress in my bones. It was amazing, I&#x27;ve never felt more alive in my life. All my back pain I had, I haven&#x27;t had since that night.

The entire time I didn&#x27;t even use my phone because I was told it would ruin the experience. I had a girl I wanted to talk to but I didn&#x27;t worry about it the entire time. He was on his phone for a part of the trip. Well, he wanted to contact a friend it&#x27;s like 7 or 8 am at this point. I not knowing what I was doing was like hey, let me try contacting him without a cellphone.

Not even knowing what I was doing, I sit down onto the ground. In a weird lotus pose pushing my feet together and start meditating and breathing. I think as if I know where he is, and push my mind into his? Not sure how to describe it, but it very weird. As soon as I try to contact him I see smoke <mark>blow</mark>ing out of what looks like my mouth. Yet, I&#x27;m at his house and I felt like I was him. I

The thing is, I&#x27;ve never tried or even read about the term astral projecting or mediation but I think that is what I did. A few moments after he texts my cousin &quot;woah&quot; and we dropped it off there. Because I honestly thought I was crazy and so did he. For the rest of the day, I had so much energy and I had no anxiety. I thought it was amazing. Well, that energy and freedom never left.

It&#x27;s been 4 months since that experience and I&#x27;ve never felt better. It&#x27;s been rough don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I feel as if I&#x27;m working towards something now. I feel like I understand many things much better. I have helped many people with emotional depression and life choices. Remember, I am no one special. I&#x27;ve used my own free time to type this and to study about how it all works.

This is sort of unrelated, but over the next month or two I was talking his ear off. He thought I went mad, yet I had information to back it up. I was always coming up with new realizations and sharing them. He&#x27;d look at me with this confused ass look. Yet, one night on MDMA I woke him up with a few lines I stored from a couple philosophers. Now, once money isn&#x27;t a issue we will share this knowledge.

I&#x27;m missing a bunch of details, yet I believe some spirit touched my soul that night. It opened doors to a whole new perception of life. One day everyone will understand how we are all truly connected. I think of it like this, I was a computer without internet. Maybe acid is a spiritual version of a wake up call to some. Because, I am no longer a computer without internet. I have been reconnected by something or someone. Because a computer can&#x27;t plug itself in.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Please bare with me while I stroke my raging nostalgia boner (figuratively, of course)

This is a long and complicated story, but I just need to put it into words, its been so long since it was part of my life...

Please note that this is all true, and none is exaggerated by childhood imagination.

In 2nd grade, me and my friend wanted to make a club that would be for something innocent (I think it was for telling jokes or something). 
We named the club Pie Inc., cause pie is good, I don&#x27;t know... We started it as a friendly hangout club on the playground... 

By grade 3 it had become a bit more of an organization. With the edition of new, enterprising members, we started organizing a bit. It wasn&#x27;t an overnight process. We didn&#x27;t go from a hangout club to a large group in a couple days. We slowly became more serious, starting with the creation of ranks. Us kids being influenced by war stereotypes, the ranks were things like &quot;commander&quot;, and &quot;soldier&quot;. Painfully unoriginal stuff like that. Me and my friend who created it, we were Pie Commanders, the highest rank. We started a black market of sorts then, letting people trade items like legos and cards, away from the prying eyes of teachers. We had &quot;stations&quot; all around the school and playground. These were basically areas that we deemed hidden enough, and we usually had members who volunteered to stay at their station for a whole recess (no joke). Basically we kept kids safe to do things we thought the teachers unfairly frowned upon. Two kids would bring cards to school and move to a certain station during recess, where one of the aforementioned volunteers would watch the area as the trade took place, as trading personal possessions (even with full consent from both parties) was not allowed at school. 

As 3rd grade went by, we started becoming like an organization, I like to believe that our purpose was to be an embassy and union for kids at the school. We were good leaders though, we never let anything bad happen. Money transactions were not allowed in the black market, and we would get our members out of trouble, usually by taking the bullet. We knew that we were asking people to break rules, and we were responsible. By 4th grade, we were (and I do not exaggerate when I say this) like a political party at the school. Imagine that the teachers were one party, and we were the other. 

4th grade is where it got very interesting. Most of us call this period &quot;The Corruption&quot;, because as we gained popularity and success, more people joined. The more people that joined, the less strict and careful our standards became. We started having higher ranked members that we trusted, to do the recruitment, because we couldn&#x27;t keep personally meeting new members. This explosion of poorly screened recruits meant we had less control over our people. Black markets started allowing money unchecked. When me and my co-leader friend would visit stations, we would find our &quot;guards&quot; doing nothing as kids spent real money on things. We would shut that down when we saw it, but I always knew there were more all the time. In addition to the lawless Black markets, we had members giving us a bad name by starting Pie Inc. mercenary businesses. We literally had our members being payed to teach other kids a lesson. It was terrible, and gave us a horrible name. Members also started creating new, higher ranks to call themselves. Our organized ranking system was being undermined by ranks like &quot;super pie god&quot;, it was becoming ridiculous. As the mercenary businesses gained traction and attention, we (me and my co-leader) were pulled from class, and double teamed by the principle and the bitchy school therapist. They told us to stop Pie Inc. or be punished. My co-leader cried, but I was a tough goddamn cookie. I calmly told them that we wouldn&#x27;t stop it, but that we agreed the corrupt mercenaries were bad. They seemed annoyed that Pie Inc. was to remain, we weren&#x27;t some club anymore, they couldn&#x27;t scare us into stopping. I placated them by promising to write formal laws for the Pie Inc., and start a cleanup of the corruption. As Winter crept up on us, the peace was broken. 

Prior to the Winter of 4th grade, we were unchallenged aside from the teachers. But as we started to make stricter rules for Pie Inc., those who started the corruption defected and started a rebellion against Pie Inc. It was a huge <mark>blow</mark>. The leader had been our friend since before the creation of Pie Inc. The rebels were much less organized, and more violent, and lawless. They went as far as to throw small rocks, we started literally carving small shivs out of bark, not sharp enough to penetrate, just for a warning jab. The Rebellion started telling the principle vital info about members and operations we had going. It got so bad that at one point we had to do all business in secret, and had to call Pie Inc. &quot;3.14&quot; as a code name. As it began to snow, we started rebuilding our empire. We began building huge (lots of snow had fallen, so I mean **huge**) snow forts for our operations. These were all out in the fields around the playground, so they served as much more hidden stations for us. We made windows, seats, tables, all out of snow. We even made trenches connecting the forts. We now had a good base, much better than our previous scattered stations. We created a larger fort with two seats and a table, for me and my co-leader to plan and receive info, it was wondrous, my young fantasies come true. We created a map of the school, and kept it on the snow table during recess, for planning and strategy. Then it became a real war. On a cold Wednesday, a medium sized rock crashed into one of our fort walls. I had been inspecting a recently collapsed trench when it happened. Me and my co-leader were called to the site, and we found that the Rebellion had started throwing rocks from the playground at our forts. We bunkered up, to keep safe. We knew we couldn&#x27;t force our people to be in danger to defend the forts, so me and my co-leader threw icy snowballs back to suppress the Rebellion attack, alone. After they left, we all removed stones from the fort walls. We knew now that it was serious between us and the Rebellion. Over the winter we slowly beat them back, and used some very brave sleeper agents (not kidding) that embedded into the Rebellion, to give us info. We used that info to steal their stashes of shivs and rocks, and to sabotage their small, scattered forts. Eventually they died down, and some rejoined us. The rejoining recruits started back at the bottom, but we made one mistake. We gave into stupid nepotism and welcomed the leader of the Rebellion back as his previous high rank. He soon weaseled up to our rank, and made himself a leader. 

After the Rebellion, we had calm peace. We started training special members to sneak through the school halls for various reasons during recess. You had to have a mark on your Pie Inc. card (everyone had one) that showed you were qualified, before entering the halls during recess, because going into the halls and classrooms during recess was not allowed, so we needed to trust every person who went in. These sneaks were used for different reasons. The main reason was benign things, like sneaking into classes to find out the lesson schedule for the week, which was a great help. But we also had them doing things like sneaking into classrooms to take back confiscated items that had been kept for too long by the teacher, as our teachers tended to forget to give these items back. 5th grade was all peace and more building of our organization. 

At the end of 5th grade, before graduating, we gathered all members in our main station, and gave a small speech, thanking them for their time and loyalty, and saying a sad goodbye to our 5 year old empire, which we had poured our energy into for all those years. It makes me sad just remembering the goodbye, it seemed like the end of our childhoods. We all went our separate ways after that, as we entered different middle schools. My co-leader is still my best friend, and he lives right next to me, so we keep the last vestiges of our Pie Inc. alive in our friendship. I think running this made us much closer and trusting of each other, as we are still great team players together. 

It&#x27;s been 5 or so years since the end of Pie Inc., and it is surreal looking back and thinking how we had a whole empire, with considerable power, and it&#x27;s gone now. Imagine having that power, then moving on. We moved on from 5 years of controlling a large union for the kids of the school, we survived a rebellion, we met with the principle multiple times and talked calm school politics with them, and now it&#x27;s all gone. It&#x27;s a bit hard to believe that so much work can go away so quick. I was inspired to write about Pie Inc. when i found some old documents from those days. I found my Pie I.D with my rank and name, a log of all recruits, and a couple maps with strategic points added. I also found my trusty wooden jab shiv, which brought back a wave of memories. Thanks to those who read this, I just had to tell someone about Pie Inc., I don&#x27;t want it to be forgotten completely.

I know this is painfully long, so if you couldn&#x27;t read it:

**tl;dr** Spent elementary school as the leader of a organization which aimed to protect us kids from the teacher&#x27;s strictness, then survived a rebellious civil war.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dviss/allergy_empathy/" target="_blank" class="title">Allergy Empathy</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I suffer from allergies. Probably got it from mom...somehow...and was born on one of the first days of spring--a factor, I&#x27;ve long suspected, half-seriously. But regardless, I think the general population of people who do not suffer from allergies have never really quite gotten the hang of understanding the devastating effects of it all. They seem to either dismiss the yelps and wails and gnashing of teeth as exaggerated posturing and whininess, replete with attentionwhoring, or they seem to show genuine concern but have no real idea of how to help. Here are two things you need to know about allergy sufferers.
 
1. The effects of allergies, at their very worst, can be utterly debilitating. A person is reduced to nothing more than a bag of flesh and bone. They are rendered useless, a non-functioning human being. The stress of dealing with something seemingly beyond your ability to change or effect, combined with the literal physical and mental pain induced by the constant agony, produces a *Pi* drill-like effect. You want to simultaneously scream and die. Any allergy sufferer will tell you that we have, literally and without exaggeration, seriously considered putting out our eyes or ripping our nose off our face or jabbing sharp objects into our ears...things that would no doubt hurt but yet seem inconsequential compared to the imagined relief. I think people don&#x27;t understand how seriously we entertain these barbaric thoughts, usually brought to a boil after years of quasi-constant internal chaos. Note: this is also why non-allergy sufferers need to be careful with their pitiable colds and how they&#x27;ve used, gosh, like twenty tissues in two minutes. Imagine! Allergies affect quality of life, no two ways about it. Studies have shown that they can affect sex lives and self-esteem. I wouldn&#x27;t mind singing for a career, but then I remember that a single off night would nearly prevent me from breathing, let alone singing in front of a group of people as my job. 
 
2. Allergy sufferers generally hate pity and rote advice. Please, no &quot;oh you poor baby&quot;s or &quot;awwww, I&#x27;m so sowwy&quot;s. We get that enough from our mommas. A genuine &quot;damn, that sucks&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m sorry your allergies are bothering you so bad today&quot; would be a pleasant and surprising change of pace. To go along with that, please try to refrain from suggesting panaceas; just assume we have tried it. That may not always be a perfect assumption, but damned if it isn&#x27;t accurate most of the time. Allergies cannot always be turned off so easily. For some people, the medicines from TV do jack all. Combining medicines doesn&#x27;t even help sometimes. And when we&#x27;re lucky enough to get something that does help, there are usually side effects. I tried to type a text message this morning under the influence, and my brain and body were moving so slowly that I was probably only hitting one character every second or so. I literally could not even force my fingers to type faster. Now imagine having to driving a car or do your job like that.
 
And yet non-sufferers don&#x27;t seem to grant us the understanding of someone battling a permanent disability or an incurable disease. Because allergies are temporary/intermittent and &quot;curable,&quot; right? That&#x27;s like saying if I cut your leg off for an hour and then magically restore it, you shouldn&#x27;t whine about the pain in the meantime. Walk that shit off...oh whoops. Really, though, I&#x27;m only writing this to vent a tad, and in the hopes that non-allergy sufferers can empathize with us a bit more. Yes, we&#x27;re annoying when we sniffle and snort and <mark>blow</mark> our noses and wheeze and breathe heavily through our mouths because our noses don&#x27;t function. I bet we&#x27;re *really* damned annoying. But you know what? We usually aren&#x27;t even thinking of the inconvenience to you. Sorry about that.

            <div class="content collapsed">This is going to be very long. And as long as it is, I leave out A LOT.

The first time I noticed my ex-friend&#x27;s less than desirable treatment of her stepchild was several years ago. I later spoke to her husband’s sibling about it. I thought this was something that needed to be discussed but I was worried maybe I was <mark>blow</mark>ing it out of proportion. The sibling told me she is probably just stressed being a stay-at-home mom to two children while her husband works really long hours. I decided that maybe that was it and I was determined to lighten her load more to prevent her from having the kind of stress that causes that behavior.

I should have spoken up.

Things became worse when one day while playing stepchild accidently broke bio-child’s arm. She wasn’t in the room when it happened and the two were playing with an indoor trampoline. She was convinced that the stepchild didn’t care that he had hurt his brother, that he did it on purpose, and began to complain that he was evil. I disagreed and told her she was just upset but she knows he didn&#x27;t do it on purpose and that he wasn&#x27;t evil. She sort of dropped it.

During hangouts with her and my other friends she would frequently bring up the topic of her stepchild and how awful he was. My other friends would ask about it later and I would say, “She’s just not good with kids, and he can be a handful.” I thought she just needed to vent. I just didn’t want to face the idea that someone I cared about wasn’t as good a person as I thought.

I was also helping my ex-friend with a lot of other things. She didn’t have a car or a driver’s license and her husband worked out of town. Them being my friends, I would gladly help whenever they needed me. I am big on acts of service, and I was certain if the roles were reversed my ex-friend would do the same.

Her husband (my friend) shared a mutual friend with me (who at the time was also my roommate). E (as I will call him) I suspected did not like the new wife of our friend, but I didn’t ask. Though it was pretty evident that he did not care for her as my friend. E would tell me that ex-friend would never do for me the things I did for her. I would argue that is because she wasn’t in a position to, and, friendships aren’t transactional.

To add another layer, but an important one, I have bipolar disorder and because of that I tend to question my own feelings and reactions. I would often blame myself if I felt the ‘vibe’ was off and claim to my own mind that I was just being paranoid.

Ex-friend claimed we had miscommunications. Often. We would set time’s and dates or try to plan things and I would recall we had agreed on one thing and she would insist we had agreed on something different. Or that I had not communicated something at all. Due to my disorder I have memory issues and so I would go with her word over mine even though my gut told me differently. E was on occasion privy to the original conversations, and he would remind me that I was correct and she was wrong. I would then say something along the lines of “Maybe she forgot because she has so much going on.”

My denial game was strong.

I found myself at her beck and call. I can’t say that was necessarily a bad thing as I love helping my friends out and she seemed to need it so much. Her husband would thank me and send us out on girl dates that he would pay for in gratitude. She would call me her sister and say she didn’t know what she would do without me.

Honestly, I enjoyed our friendship. I loved her bio-child so much it hurt to leave him and helping them out gave me such a sense of accomplishment and belonging. I think that’s why I tried to sweep her behavior towards her stepchild to the side. He was only there in the summer and around Christmas. Maybe she’d mellow? Maybe I could blame it on my own paranoia?

With each visit after the broken arm she got worse.

It came to a head late spring of 2024. The child had requested not to spend the whole summer with his father. She was livid. She was going off about what an evil child he was. That he was a monster (not the first time she had referred to him as that) and that everything he did was with the intention of hurting his father. I disagreed that his intention was to hurt his father (he was 10) he probably didn’t give a second thought to his father when he asked. I said if anything this was definitely his mom’s influence (ex-wife is super crazy. I knew her when the husband was married to her. She’s crazy.) Ex-friend then began to angrily reiterate the child was evil, and a monster, and that he was just like his mother and wanted to hurt his father.

I could feel the years of repressing my feelings toward this matter about to break.

She then stated, “I do NOT want THAT CHILD in MY house!” Followed by, “I can’t wait for him to turn 12 and tell the judge he doesn’t want to see his father anymore!”

I said, “That is your husband’s son!”

She replied, “I know it will hurt him, but he’ll get over it.”

By this point I had found a really good medication. My memory had strengthened, and my symptoms had gone and I could no longer blame my reaction on paranoia or faulty emotional processing. 

So, I told her it was wrong that she felt that way. He was a child and her calling him evil and a monster crossed a line. She laid into me. She accused me of loving her stepchild more than her bio-child. She complained that everyone did. That whenever he came around everyone paid so much attention him and not her own child. I interrupted to remind her that they get to see her child all the time. She didn’t think that was a good enough excuse. She accused me of preferring one child over the other, and that I was only friends with her and her husband to gain access to the stepchild (gross). I argued back that her child was bright, and deeply loved by everyone around him, that he had every advantage including financial that his brother did not have. That his brother had no stability, and a crazy mother that definitely had some emotional incest issues as well as using him as a weapon against his father. The least she could do for him was show him some fucking empathy for what he had to go through when he isn’t at his dad’s house. She said she didn’t care what he dealt with. I told her that was fucked up and she needed to consider his feelings at least once. She then told me I cared more about his feelings than I did her husband’s or hers. “Yes!” I said, “Because he is a 10-year-old boy and children matter more to me than my friendships.”

I wanted to hit her. To scream for her husband and make her repeat every word to him. I found myself backing down. I didn’t want to cause him any more upset than he was in at the moment.

I should have spoken to her husband then. He was my friend after all. His child’s well-being needed to be my top priority like I had just claimed. 

Like the coward I was I decided to wait and see.

I made the mistake of thinking my friend and I would get past this. It was our first real fight and I could see how my aggressive reaction to her situation would be taken badly.

It was also around this time that I began to need help. Really, deeply, need it.

I began to ask her for assistance. Nothing major. She now had a driver’s license and access to a car regularly. I just asked her to come over and be my cheerleader while I tried to force myself to do housework. I told her she could bring bio-child because he loved it at his aunt’s house, and he wanted to see the chickens and I would make sure to buy her whole family dinner so she didn’t have to cook. She would vaguely agree and then back out last minute.

I asked every week for two months. Not once did she try. Her excuses ranged from “I forgot” to “bio-child isn’t feeling well” and “husband wants me to stay home.” It was the last excuse she started using that made me realize she was lying. If I told her husband I needed aide, that man would drop anything to help me. I had done so much for his family and he wanted me to know how much it was appreciated.

One day I decided to test her lie. I spoke to Husband while she was in their kitchen. I told him that I was sorry that he had been feeling so badly this week. He looked confused. I then said something along the lines of “Your wife said you were feeling too bad to come over on (insert day of the week).” He looked extra confused and before he could answer ex-friend practically ran out of the kitchen, “Remember Husband! You said you didn’t want to do anything or go anywhere? Remember?!” She looked so panicked, and he looked at her and said, “You didn’t say we were going to OP’s house! That’s different. I just didn’t want to go shopping.” Ex-friend looked between the two of us with such wide eyes I could tell she knew she had been caught. I still didn’t call her out. I let her pretend it was one of her classic ‘misunderstandings.’

From that moment on I began to question our entire friendship. Was it really so weak that it couldn’t handle one fight?

Soon she was lying to me to keep me from being involved with her bio-child.

Then she tried to bring up her stepchild in a negative light but gently. I guess to gauge my reaction. I told her point blank I knew she didn’t love her stepchild or hell even like him. I also told her I didn’t expect her to. If she couldn’t love a child that wasn’t hers I wouldn’t judge her for that. However, her mistreating her stepchild needed to stop. If she couldn’t get that under control, I understood it being too hard to talk to her husband about, but she needed to seek professional help to deal with it. She looked at me so coldly and I quote, “You see inside me so well sometimes it’s scary.” The conversation ended and her extreme pettiness ensued.

After that she went through a number of passive aggressive tactics towards me. It’s now September and I am no longer blaming myself or thinking it’s in my head. She began to act like I was insulting her when I complimented her. She began to argue with things I said for no reason.

I was faced with a dilemma. I loved her husband and her child so much. I knew if I ended things with her I ended things with them. There was no dropping the one without the other two being taken from me. I determined to try to be civil. She definitely noticed.

By this point she had taken to calling me high maintenance when no one was around. I’d get very angry at this considering how controlling she was and how much she refused to help me with anything. I know I never reacted well to this. She would never explain what she meant by it either which just made me angrier. Not my finest moments.

My birthday at end of September rolls around and my favorite relative died. I was grieving. My birthday party became a grieving party. She told me she wasn’t attending. I was relieved. I took to drinking and low and behold who shows up to the adult birthday party with a kindergartener in tow. I almost turned her away at the door. In my grief I didn&#x27;t want to watch her be a fake friend to me in front of everyone else. She wouldn’t set foot in my house for months no matter how much I begged for help and here she was when there was an appearance to make and no help to have to give. FUCK HER. I’m still boiled over not throwing her out. I sent the child to see his Oma (my mother) in a back room because this is a house filled with adults drinking and I don’t play that.

I knew the moment I saw her (she was all smiles and no condolences) that in one hour she’d get a call from her husband and she’d have to go home. Like clockwork call came, she bounced. I was relieved.

I didn’t handle my Uncle’s death well at all. In October I fell back hard on the bottle (recovering alcoholic) and I went through two different bipolar episodes. I can’t say I was never a bitch to her in that time. I can’t say I wasn’t outward in my displeasure of her as a human. She’d let me down in every possible way and I’m not good at pretending to like people I don’t.

She invited me out to have a girls lunch almost two weeks after my birthday. She said just us. We never do that anymore. I was so excited. I thought for a brief moment that maybe she’d finally come around. I agreed to meet up with her for lunch the next. After we planned it all out she suddenly added. She wouldn’t have the car and her neighbors will be gone so she needed me to take her to run some errands afterwards. My heart broke. My fault. I believed her. My weak, doormat ass went anyway and did the errands and then left after I got to see bio-child. It had begun to hurt to be around him because I knew the days were numbered.

October was a mess and when Halloween came around I started telling her I wasn’t doing Halloween at her house (a tradition we had formed). She kept insisting on it and I kept saying no. Finally, in what I realized later was a manipulation tactic she had used for years and it took all this for me to see it, “Husband will be so upset if you don’t.” I caved. So, in near full-<mark>blow</mark>n psychosis, I white knuckled clung to some form of sanity and handed candy out at their house. Every time she came near me my skin crawled with a need for escape. Crazy is a hard thing to choke down and I hadn’t had to do that in a while. Whether she and her new friend really were talking shit about me in front of me or not I don’t know. That could have been the crazy and the paranoia. But they certainly weren’t whispering around me when Husband was outside.

On Thanksgiving we all got together with E and I cooked the worst meal of my life. I was so uncomfortable. She kept coming in the kitchen and then walking out. I’d try to be nice for the Husband and child’s sake, but she’d act like I was being bitchy. The food was bland and unserviceable.

When E and I were leaving she hugged him and said she was glad he came because they had no friends that lived nearby and the bitch looked dead at me.

After that E asked me wtf was the problem. I finally broke down and told him everything. Something I hadn’t done because he had been warning me this would happen for ages. Why? Because he never believed she was really my friend, and she was only using me till she didn’t need me anymore.

Weirdly, I don’t think that was entirely accurate, even now. I do believe, however, that a friendship with me afforded her a lot of conveniences that made dealing with me worth it.

Sometime in November I had agreed to watch the bio-child while her and her husband went to a thing in December and she didn’t think she had anyone else to watch him. I guess I was still useful.

I was excited too because she had been limiting my access to him so much and even what I suspect was weaponizing him on a few occasions. Something I had previously not thought possible of her. E was not surprised.

I told my mom that we were going to take him out Christmas shopping and buy him whatever he wanted because I was going to end things with his family and we would not be seeing him again. My mom understood. Turns out she thought my ex-friend was using me the whole time too. I’m still not convinced that is all it was. (Side note: My BFF who lives in another state also didn’t like this friend and thought she was fake. Why don’t I listen?)

The night before I was to watch bio-child I was at a party. Husband was there too. I asked him if bio-child was excited for his weekend at Aunt’s and Oma’s house. Husband looked confused and told me ex-friend said I couldn&#x27;t and they got someone else. I was not able to hide my displeasure. I almost spewed everything about everything all over on him. But it wasn’t the place. Not cowardice this time. It really wasn’t the right time and place. I texted ex-friend about it and she said “just another misunderstanding. Not the first time. Won’t be the last.” I immediately said in my head. “Yes, the fuck it is.” She told my mom a different story. She knew damn well I could watch him. She just decided to weaponize her kid against me. I was done with all of them.

I didn’t speak again till I was ready to end things. That was after Christmas. Let Husband be happy through the holiday. He didn’t do anything but be oblivious to his own wife’s lying and manipulation.

I fucked up on the finish line. I started messaging wanting to know why she was mistreating me. She accused me of everything she had been doing. Passive aggression, pettiness, that I changed as a person and she was just “stand-offish”.  She then said she still wanted to be friends, but only in a group setting? What the fuck does that mean?

I accused her of using me. I expected a fight from that but instead she insisted on meeting up and talking it out in person.

I paused. What?

I talked to E. He told me not to do it. He said just go ahead and break it off. She doesn’t care. She’s not trying to fix things.

I knew she wasn’t trying to fix things, but damn it I was curious as to where it was going. I figured I’d meet up with her. Let her play the victim. Then I’d break things off with her.

Bitch brought Husband and bio-child with her.

I ended up just talking about how great my life was going and I genuinely regret only talking about me to Husband, but I could barely look at ex-friend and seeing bio-child was destroying me. I asked to take him on the Christmas shopping spree I had planned on taking him on and Husband said yes. Husband even tried to set up going out to lunch with us. He clearly had no idea. I gave him a farewell present disguised as a birthday gift. He loved it.

I never brought myself to say anything to him. I am a coward.

We parted ways. I hugged bio-child for the last time and he asked me to come over and stay the night. I said not today. It hurt so fucking bad. It still hurts to think about. I loved him for years and I still love him and I will never see him again.

I considered pretending to fix things with her so that I could occasionally see the other two. I’m not good with that. I decided to sleep on it and when I woke up I was going to text ex-friend and tell her it was over, except I had received a very early text that morning from her ending things.

I was angry but mostly at myself. She stopped me from breaking up with her so that she could break up with me.

I felt so stupid.

I failed Husband. I failed him as a friend. I should have opened his eyes to his wife’s mistreatment of his first born. I’m sure he sometimes sees but doesn’t wish to see. I want to apologize to him so badly.

I miss bio-child. I miss him so much it hurts.

Most of all. I am so sorry to stepchild. The one I failed the most. She doesn’t hit him. But emotional and psychological scars run deep and who knows how many I allowed with my silence and how many more he will receive now that my silence isn’t my choice.

I screwed up. Fuck that lying bitch. But I definitely screwed up on so many levels.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m not really sure where to start. Apologies in advance if this is ramble-y, it will probably be mostly word vomit and will definitely be long but there&#x27;s just a lot to get off my chest, and as the title may suggest, this whole thing makes me quite a bit nervous. 

Within the last week or so, I, 24f, passed the two year anniversary of graduating college and it&#x27;s caused me to do a lot of reflecting about where I am post-grad and where I thought I&#x27;d be and what my current potential is and I realized that I&#x27;m depressed. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety while in high school so this isn&#x27;t anything that&#x27;s new necessarily but it&#x27;s something I had been managing and something that I think snuck up on me. Or maybe I just willfully ignored it. 

While in college, I was in an abusive relationship for around 3 years and 9-ish months. Pretty much from the beginning of freshman year to graduation. I was 18 when we started dating and he was 20, we were both freshmen in the same class, same major at college. A post about our relationship would definitely be a whole other story but it was nice at first. The abuse started a couple months in, it evolved into constant manipulation, gaslighting, trauma dumping, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, etc etc etc. My ex - &quot;P&quot; - experienced extreme depression and anxiety. Towards the end of our relationship he was diagnosed with OCD, I suspected that he had some sort of personality disorder as well but I am not a psychiatrist. 

When P was 19, he was seeing a new therapist who had a fear of technology, automation, the advancement of AI, you name it, and brought that up during his sessions. P&#x27;s mind is extremely obsessive and malleable, once it latches onto an idea then that&#x27;s it and P&#x27;s mind latched onto the fear of AI and technology advancement like nothing else. When we were dating he would frequently wake me up by calling me in the middle of the night to have a panic attack on the phone with me about some random article he saw about some random scientist being &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that AI was going to take over humanity. I would talk him down for about 20 minutes, hang up, finally fall back asleep and he would call me back 15 minutes later because &quot;Well what about this other article?&quot; The obvious solution to that was to put my phone away and turn it on silent or do not disturb. I did, originally. I had DnD set for everyone but my emergency contacts (just my Mom) during bedtime hours but then there was the first of those nights where P called me and I was asleep and didn&#x27;t answer. He blew up on me the following day and accused me of not caring, of not being there for him, that maybe we should just break up, and that he knew this relationship was a mistake. So, naturally, I added him to the emergency contact list. Anyway, that&#x27;s probably off topic. 

P&#x27;s fear of technology was intense. We were in a video production oriented program in college and so we dealt with gear and cameras on a daily basis. He would have weekly panic attacks about the cinema camera becoming obsolete because the iPhone camera was getting better and other technological advances like that he saw as a threat. However, during junior year of college the fear shifted from the fear of actual technological advances to the fear of social media and cancel culture. 

In December of junior year, after we had been dating a little over two years, an ex of his from a year or so prior to us dating sent him a message on Instagram and accused him of raping her when they were together. 

It happened when I was home for winter break, I lived about 3-4 hours away from campus and he lived with his parents in the town that our school was in. She messaged him on Instagram out of the blue and said she wanted to talk. He said sure and then as the text conversation went she alluded to him being extremely pushy during sex and that he <mark>forced</mark> her into sex when she wasn&#x27;t ready, especially the first time they had sex which was her first time. He called me panicking. I&#x27;m not proud of it, but my first reaction was to just tell him that of course she&#x27;s lying. She couldn&#x27;t possibly decide now that you raped her then, it just sounds like she wanted to lose her virginity to her current boyfriend and so to make him feel better she&#x27;s accusing you of rape. It calmed him down a little but not really. His parents intervened, he almost was sent to the hospital but eventually calmed down enough for us to not fear that he was going to hurt himself. This was the first inkling for me that maybe the way he treated me wasn&#x27;t normal or right. That maybe yeah, he was very pushy during sex and that&#x27;s not okay. But I wasn&#x27;t ready to admit to myself that the person that I was in love with (maybe it was love, I&#x27;m not so sure anymore) would be that kind of person. 

He spoke about it to me a lot. It became the only thing that we talked about. The fear that he was a rapist and that he was a selfish and irredeemable piece of scum and I would have to talk him back up and tell him that he deserves to live and that he&#x27;s not a rapist and certainly not irredeemable. It was exhausting. It was constant. But it was internal, I could handle it because it was happening just between the two of us. The girl didn&#x27;t go to our school or anything so there wasn&#x27;t a spread of people knowing.  

After that I became less and less interested in the relationship, I think that&#x27;s the seed that started the downfall. He was an asshole the whole time so I would&#x27;ve always been justified in leaving him but this was the first time I was like &quot;Oh, fuck. He&#x27;s manipulating me. He&#x27;s taking advantage of me.&quot; 

In late January or early February, at around 3 in the morning on a Saturday I was woken up, yet again, by P calling me and when I answered he&#x27;s crying on the other end telling me how he messed up and how he&#x27;s so &quot;fucking stupid&quot;. I get him to calm down and tell me what&#x27;s going on. He tells me that he went to N&#x27;s house and got really high with her. N is the best friend of H, a mutual friend of P&#x27;s and I. H was closer to P than with me but I did definitely feel like we were on the same friendship plane. Neither P or I were really friends with N, in fact, I didn&#x27;t really like N. I thought that all N did was get high on various drugs and that she was a bad influence. So waking up in the middle of the night to hear that P had been to her house and got really high with her, did not make me happy that&#x27;s for sure. But I just rolled my eyes and said okay because I wanted to go back to bed and him calling me in the middle of the night to tell me he had just done drugs at someone&#x27;s house was not new. But, he said that there was something else. That he had messed up some other way. I asked him if he had sex with her and he said no that he hadn&#x27;t had sex but that she had given him a <mark>blow</mark>job. And because they were both high he just let it happen and that he was so sorry and he&#x27;s going to do everything he can to win back my trust. At the time, I remember just feeling nothing when he told me. 

We stayed together and pretended like nothing happened for a few weeks after that but right before Spring Break, early March probably a month or so after the phone call from P, P gets a phone call from N telling him that what happened on that night was <mark>forced</mark>, she was drugged and nearly unconscious and P <mark>forced</mark> her down on him, and that P is a sexual assaulter and he should come clean about it. P had a total meltdown at the accusation. He started hurting himself on his hands so that way he could never forget what he did. It was a lot. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a lot of it, and it was his parent&#x27;s dealing with it. I was just dealing with all the stomach twisting anxiety on the other end the entirety of the week of Spring Break. At one point N sent both me and P a Google Doc that was titled &quot;Your Boyfriend Assaulted Me and You Need to Accept That&quot;. If I could apologize to N now, for how I handled the whole thing, I would. 

H, who was also in our class and major in school, ostracized us. Me, really. It was a male dominated major and so there were only 5 girls in the class. I was never really all that close with the other three but suddenly it went from all five of us in the class to Them and Me. And honestly, I don&#x27;t blame her. Her friend had just come out about a sexual assault and the perpetrator was my boyfriend that I was supporting for the most part. I didn&#x27;t come out at any point and say &quot;P did NOT do that thing!&quot; but unfortunately, I know that I shamed N to P and to other people. Called her story bogus and that you can&#x27;t figure out an assault happened a month after it happened. I hate using the self preservation excuse but I truly have no idea what would&#x27;ve happened to me if I told P that I agreed with the people accusing him. 

Acknowledging that he had raped the girl from before me and had assaulted N meant that I had to accept that everything he was doing to me was rape or assault and I was not ready to accept that. I would never be in the mood, because he treated me like shit, and he would beg and plead and keep me up at night for hours until I gave in and either had sex with him or gave him a <mark>blow</mark> job. He would then tell me that he felt so unloved in our relationship and start crying and asking me if I know how it feels to feel so unwanted and so then I would respond with the fact none of my needs are met. He didn&#x27;t compliment me, or focus on me during sex, or do things for me, or plan any sort of dates, I mean the man didn&#x27;t even keep up with a regular shower habit despite me asking him to, and so I would bring all of this up to him and his response would be that he would feel more inclined to do all of those things if I were to have sex with him more often. 

I knew that the relationship was over but I was so afraid to break up with him. Our school was small, less than 30 in our class for our major and so we were intertwined with everything each other was doing. There would be no easy way to break up with him and still continue on in classes, especially not with a person who is incredibly manipulative and likes to make everything about himself. So I endured. 

Everyday I listened to a constant revolving door of &quot;Am I going to be canceled?&quot; &quot;Am I a rapist&quot; &quot;What if N goes to the police?&quot; &quot;I should just kill myself because I am the worst person ever&quot;

I got so burnt out so quickly. It was all about him. His feelings his emotions his artwork his projects. All of my personal projects stopped getting any attention so they stopped existing at all. He consumed every ounce of my life with his negativity and with his fear and with his wrongdoing and I&#x27;m really mad at myself for letting him do that. I became a mean person while we were together and while I blame him for giving me the environment to do that, I can only blame myself for my actions. 

Prior to this, because of the technology fear, P never posted on social media and only had it downloaded on his phone because of the nature of the business. After the first accusation he deleted Instagram permanently and after the second he deleted all his other forms of social media and almost downgraded his phone to a flip phone. All I would hear every day is about cancel culture and how everyone can see everything that you do online and how everyone is watching you and how everyone just cares so much about every individual thing you do. 

Rationally, I know that&#x27;s not true. There&#x27;s 8 billion of us around the world, no one is paying attention to you as much as you are paying attention to you. However, the fear is there. The fear of perception is now there. I feel like someone is always looking over my shoulder while I&#x27;m using an electronic device. I can&#x27;t post something to my Instagram story without my heart racing, wondering about who is going to see it and how it&#x27;s going to be used against me somehow. I haven&#x27;t made a post on instagram in almost two years because I can&#x27;t bring myself to posting something that people can see. I can&#x27;t even make a post to Reddit, a mostly anonymous site, because I have a fear that something somehow is going to happen because of me posting. I know that some healthy caution with the internet and electronics especially in today&#x27;s world is good but I think this goes beyond healthy. 

I&#x27;m a photographer, I can&#x27;t even publish my website because the idea of putting my photos on a site that people would go to on purpose makes me want to puke. So I&#x27;m not growing as a photographer, my brand is not progressing. I work in a world of networking, a website and a social media presence is necessary, and I&#x27;m lacking that ability. I need clients, I can&#x27;t reach out to people because I don&#x27;t have a functioning website. The fear that I&#x27;m not good enough or the fear that I&#x27;m disliked, I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s stopping my growth. I have plateaued and I know that I haven&#x27;t peaked yet and so I need to move through this. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s stopping me. So many other people have the ability to do anything online with no shame and no fear and my hand is shaking while I write a text post. 

This is a lot, if you made it this far I&#x27;m sorry for all the word soup you had to swim through to get here but I think it&#x27;s finally time for me to take a step forward. Hopefully I post this. lol. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I was born a year after the death of my sister, parents in depression they separated around the age of 3 for lack of love, my father a musician and banker my mother unhappy in an accounting job. I fall straight into a kind of weird melancholy, I cry and I&#x27;m seen as strange but I fall in love with a guy as if to forget my pain, the need for love. Need to know that love exists. I hate school and kids, sports and socializing, I don&#x27;t particularly like creating either but ultimately it&#x27;s the only activity I can do without being deathly anxious. So I draw a little, I sing and I dance very well. I like dancing, I even do it in class and I want to be a classical dancer, I want to be a star. A star. But for now I have to stop classes because my mother doesn&#x27;t like the teacher. I love my father, my mother worries me even if she knows how to give love, I prefer my father because he is chill. And he makes music which is super stylish. My mother meets a guy, they get married, they have a kid, I&#x27;ve rarely seen her so stressed, she wants to lose weight all the time. At least she gets off on me because she follows me until the first minute of school to make me learn my homework by heart, something I don&#x27;t enjoy doing. I&#x27;m only good at languages ​​and anything that requires being creative, writing stories is probably what I prefer. We write about it with Dad, in a notebook that I have kept carefully despite moving far too many times. I find myself ugly, short, fat, uninteresting, I think I have a big nose and brown eyes, which is bad. I try to arrange hours in front of the mirror, based on clothes and hair, my worst nightmare is arriving at school with my hair disheveled. I like a lot of guys I&#x27;ve never talked to: in the end dreaming about these guys remains my favorite activity. Dreaming and thinking. The holy J that I will be called in 6th grade, returning to ND being the beginning of the end. Private and Catholic school with the atmosphere that one imagines, very austere, very gloomy. I run away as soon as I can, I escape, I am there but not there. My grades are average. I do the bare minimum. I know what to do to get through without overdoing it. I am jealous of those who are motivated, more talented, more beautiful, more elegant, richer. I am nothing. I am with the recluses, those who are discreet. I meet C, we begin a life of rebellion, we smoke, drink, go clubbing, fuck, steal, eat, run, fall in love, travel, in short we try to imitate life as we imagine it to be better. We take advantage of every opportunity to do something new and in Paris there is no shortage of that. I have other girlfriends. But I can&#x27;t go out too much, my mother stops me, so I quickly move in with my father. What hasn&#x27;t helped me feel good all this time is this disgusting lump in my heart that keeps me from <mark>sleeping</mark>, from just being, from thinking, from living, that&#x27;s what makes me want to die and makes me write suicide letters at 14. It&#x27;s only my friends who see that I&#x27;m bad but I can&#x27;t even explain why I don&#x27;t know. The truth is that when I was 9 years old, my stepmother infiltrated my father&#x27;s heart without me realizing it to destroy him from the inside. An American who arrives, met on a dating site with whom my father will make a magnificent child, I. We live through hell together: my parents have a relationship based on sex. They don&#x27;t travel with us, they don&#x27;t calculate us, especially me. At 17 my stepmother admitted to me that all this time she didn&#x27;t love me because she was jealous of me, wanted my father&#x27;s attention. Basically, that explains everything. She did everything, to the worst, to disgust me with life. Until I saw her sex tapes with my father, heard them and saw them having sex every day. One day we had a cat, they left for two weeks without warning, lying so that I would stay with my mother but suspect nothing. The cat is dead, in the toilet. I came back and learned that they had left by lying to me and that even a cat would not survive more than a year in this hell. I said to myself that yes, it was the head in the toilet that we had to finish. I didn&#x27;t do it. My friends supported me, despite some distress, I have an energy that leaves no stone unturned. I have second and third families. I&#x27;m going on vacation with some friends. I love them. I like. I make love the center of everything. My whole life and especially my decisions. I had my first time at 14 with a guy from the far suburbs. Very far from home. I was high. As often. Smoking was my only solution, my only answer. My only refuge. The only place where I felt good and understood. Toxic relationships accumulate. I too am addicted to sex while my father has orgies at the apartment. But I&#x27;m starting to get attached to my sister and she doesn&#x27;t have to go through what I went through. She was around 5 years old. So I finally scream everything I was silent about. I was mute throughout my life but especially throughout my childhood. I opened my mouth at 17, to save her, I wasn&#x27;t fooled, it was too late. I was yelling. I had become the relinquished teenager. But no, I was yelling for good reasons. The three of them started as a couple. When the third moved in, she quickly told my father who had a problem. Why is this kid screaming in this house and no one listens to her? She realized that no one had listened to or believed me for years. No consent. She told my father there was a problem. My father only listens to the women he fucks. Not his daughter. He left his first wife. That&#x27;s when she apologized and so did he. In sorry mode for these 10 years of suffering, now I&#x27;m breaking up, I&#x27;m leaving you with my disgusting vision of existence, I don&#x27;t wish you good luck, I don&#x27;t have any myself. In disgust for life mode, wasted childhood. She demolished what was most precious to me: my innocence. And my father was complicit. Then in the middle, an innocence which, by miracle, was saved a little, I hope. We will have spent unforgettable moments of pure love in an ocean of torment. Magical moments. Such complicity and such a strong bond that he even called me mom. But that’s between her and me, and I don’t even know if she remembers it. It’s so sweet and beautiful that I don’t believe anyone can believe me or understand me. I don&#x27;t think I believed it myself. And I didn&#x27;t see what I had. I didn&#x27;t see how lucky I was to know her and grow up with her. At 17, the work was done, I went to prep school. I let go of everything, Paris, my friends, my asshole father, my mother, all my landmarks. She. I went to art prep. I was inspired by my art teacher. It was when I met him that I first had hope for the future. He was the one who allowed me to express myself, I think that deep down he saved my life. How did I end up in this art class? A miracle too. Already every year I passed the next year with precision in this private high school. I went to general because I wanted to become a writer and my French teacher believed in it, she had read my essays. I had a talent for that. She pushed me towards khâgnes, take svt and philosophy, art you will withdraw, we put that otherwise you will not be accepted anywhere. Nobody asks art. I asked for art. I was refused where I wanted to go. I am transferred very far from home. I&#x27;m going through this alone. My mother hates me for what I&#x27;m becoming. Everything I represent. She wanted me to stay at Notre Dame. My father continues his depression. I&#x27;m no longer with my friends. I only have one boyfriend who is 10 years older and I&#x27;m 15. But on the one hand, I needed him. Brief. I enter this new high school for the first time and I meet this teacher who believed in me, but for real, not even what I created. He just believed me. And for the first time a teacher showed me in his eyes that he believed me when I told him that I was doing my best, and that this year, what I said every year, I was going to smash everything. Usually my depression caught up with me. And then at the end of the year all the teachers hated me. But in the end he still believed in me. So I went from last in my class to first in a year. And prepared her at 17. I left everything behind and took as much stuff as possible. I worked. I only did that. For a year, I fucked the bare minimum, once every two months, I had a suicidal boyfriend whom I left because his attempts interfered with my academic results. I wanted to focus on myself. I got lost. What I loved, I no longer knew. My life was creation, but a meaningless, <mark>forced</mark> form of creation. Deep down I just thought I was doing well to get by in life, to have a job, but above all the fine arts of Paris, to be gifted and admired one day, somewhere, by someone. I had the fine art of L, hierarchically just lower than Paris. Equivalent to second place in my head. Disappointment took everything away from me at once. The weight of the year I had spent thinking only about that was suddenly lifted from me. I&#x27;m going to L. I don&#x27;t really know why I&#x27;m doing this anymore. I remember this promise which led me to seek a future, to become rich. It was a sunny day. We were out with her. We laughed. As always, we held hands. I told him “we will have a house, just for the two of us, before I will become rich and famous, I will go to fine arts. It’s a school for artists. They say I am a good artist. » and she looked so happy that I no longer had the right to disappoint her. She wanted to leave. She wanted to go with me. I finally gave him a healthier space. But I didn&#x27;t know how to offer him the only thing I had, and that I ultimately lost: me. I left with my promise. The house, the money, I didn&#x27;t even realize it, she didn&#x27;t care. Anything would have done. But you don&#x27;t take a kid away from her father, even if he has mistreated her all her life. So he had to change. My head didn&#x27;t want to know but my body knew and it did the job, automatically. When it was needed. He spent his entire adolescence recovering his strength to fight against the attacker. The aggressor who is this damn depression. This generational evil that no one in the family was able to stop. L. A year in the void. Once again I was there, but not there. I was creating shit. I had a lover, it was cool. friends. But depression was hitting me. And then a hammer <mark>blow</mark>. I didn&#x27;t really expect it. Trip. A year that doesn&#x27;t even count in my record. As if she had never existed. As if I had never spent my year there, never set foot there. My parents believed it. They never thought I could tell the truth. I was there. I tried everything. I even have pictorial proof. Entire rooms full of tests. Of works. I could fill so many rooms with just the paper I scribbled. The tears that I shed in my songs. The dances I wanted to perform. Nothing. No impact. No interest. For no one. But even less for my mother whom I continued to disappoint. In a loop. For her, the outcome is clear: I did nothing. She called the school principal who cited absences from a theory class on a Friday morning that we all missed badly. She said that was why I was fired. I was told that I was made for illustration, or that I should think about stopping creating. I found it weird. I never really started, actually. I had the idea to prove them wrong. 
I plan to make comics for B. And for the first time since my sister, I find something that makes sense. A great common work. The underground. Those who create beneath the earth. Those who are hated. Like me. Those who stink. Those who are scary. The crazy ones. The sick. Drug addicts. I had stopped smoking, I had started exercising too intensely. I tried to become what we wanted but it didn&#x27;t work, I continued to disappoint, I felt infinitely closer to wasting shit which lives up to its name. And I was obsessed. While I was saying I&#x27;m going to B I was thinking of only one thing: getting good enough to do this guy&#x27;s covers. And all his friends. I loved everything that had to do with him. I isolated myself at my father&#x27;s house all summer. I was at 2000%. My sister wasn&#x27;t there. She was with her mother most of the time. Everyone wanted me to work. I did some research and the day I found a job I realized: why? I tried it for one day and stopped. Yet everything was perfect. Barmaid. Well paid. My father clearly told me, no work, no more help. I replied: I will live in a squat. Simple. But I didn&#x27;t know anything about it. And above all, I didn&#x27;t know anyone there. I said to myself, I&#x27;ll see then. Naively I prepared a bag, nails, a hammer, to close the door and above all no clothes, so that I could travel light. I wanted to do this year in school and in squats. The good life. Nothing to pay. The idea came to me from my new artists at the moment. I met one. He came from B. We had a crush on each other. Nothing could stop me from going there anymore. My uncle takes me in. He lives in B. Then, I find maps here and there. I have a little money, I don&#x27;t even know how, actually. My mother stopped telling me the time several months ago, but she helps me when I&#x27;m struggling too much, I find a babysitting job. Under rental. I&#x27;m stopping school. After two months. Impossible to tell my parents, I disappoint them over and over again. And it’s impossible to work more than that. I can&#x27;t do anything anymore. Stopping school was the bare minimum to be able to breathe. I couldn&#x27;t create in there. Impeded. Again. I discovered tattooing at that time. So. First tattoo, it takes. The same influences. The same artists. They become my main acquaintances. But they don&#x27;t really know me. I sing. Meet a great friend on sond cloud. Where I post my sounds. I tattoo. For the money but above all for the fame. I found it beautiful. I struggle at first. I discover other people. Tattoo artists, with whom the feeling goes better than with those of B. But I meet a guy who wants us to get married and have kids but with whom we actually only take k every other evening. I dance a lot. The tattoo progresses more from the moment I live with him. I live with him. Out of spite. But also out of love. He starts to become violent. I&#x27;m leaving as soon as possible, I don&#x27;t have the strength to get up. In the meantime I met a girl: C. A tattoo artist. We were hooked. But nothing more. No matter how hard I tried, I didn&#x27;t seem to be that interested in him. I&#x27;m already in love. Flying through Paris, I met a designer and musician to whom I had been talking for a long time. We fall in love straight away. Something stiff. I&#x27;m leaving the violent guy, I&#x27;m leaving R. A plan found on Instagram. I couldn&#x27;t stay in Paris, my parents thought I was at school and the reception was disastrous. My father didn&#x27;t want me to come and my mother hasn&#x27;t had a room for me for a long time. I had the money to pay for a 2-month sublet on R. In fact, that was a miracle too. I always tried to keep in touch with my father despite my PTSD. I wanted to see I every time I came, it was the only thing that was really important. For that I had to play it cool with my father. My best friend fished me out when I was at the bottom with the violent guy, she took my phone and arranged a trip to a friend&#x27;s house for 2 weeks. A miracle. I was able to breathe, my head was clear, he told me to go to my grandmother. The great outdoors. 3 weeks of sobriety. It was rebirth. I was finally taken care of. Then back to my father. My grandmother didn&#x27;t want me to stay like that. I was in serious depression. Suicidal urges too great to ignore. It was visible. I couldn&#x27;t stand because my heart was giving out so much. More love in me. A limp remnant of energy that I could only use to call for help. Everyone in the family knew it: I pay my bills by taking photos of my body. Naked. With old people who pay me well for that. Since I was around 15. My grandmother feels it, I am going to pass the course of prostitution. She warns my father. He&#x27;s making fun of himself. Then he says to himself that despite everything, I don&#x27;t look good. They are trying to take me to the hospital. No one can take me because I&#x27;m homeless. Too bad. But at the moment when I have my bag on my back and I literally have nowhere to go, when I&#x27;m in the red, when I just want to kill myself, I get a sudden call from my father telling me I&#x27;ll give you 500 bucks a month if you continue tattooing. And there you have it. I&#x27;m going to R. But first I pay for a ticket to Bangkok. I wanted to die in the ocean. My father told me this money is not for going to the other side of the world. I didn&#x27;t care. He knew me well. A week before departure I realize that I don&#x27;t have a passport. A. This guy. 2 months. Then what? We want to find an apartment in Paris. But in the meantime I made tattoos like I&#x27;ve never done before. I&#x27;m finally proud of myself and it feels good. I breathe a little more. We&#x27;re going to Paris. Probably thanks to the tattoos, C who is in Paris by chance suddenly wants to see me. In fact, she is grieving for her lover. I had the words when she needed them. I came to get a tattoo. A face tat on the eye. I didn&#x27;t leave for 2 months. There was T with her. He was there to help her overcome her grief but he himself was in quite a depression. The atmosphere was fun, creepy, arty, weird. It spoke to me. It was everything I had wanted to express for years. Everything she expressed. I felt alive again. I felt good. My boyfriend of the moment came, jealous of C he became oppressive I left him. Then when he left and C was committed to the psychiatric hospital, T and I both ended up feeling like idiots, and then we realized we were in love. We had spent 3 months bonding to help C, to manage my ex&#x27;s jealousy, to manage our emotions, to make cabins, to play, to annoy each other, then without me expecting it, I saw nothing coming but lo and behold: we made love and it was an extraordinary experience. Indescribable. He had broken up with his ex a few months ago, 4 years of relationships in the trash. He didn&#x27;t know where to go either. We had a huge house. The house of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend, empty for two weeks, really good people. There are things like that. We don&#x27;t expect it. Then it allowed us to breathe again, I have breathed 4 or 5 times since the beginning of the story and in a lifetime that&#x27;s not a lot. But the rest smells good. He has a project: the family home, by the sea, far from everything. His parents conceived him there. It&#x27;s scary but it makes you dream. I am. But not for love. I no longer wanted to do anything for love. Not out of love for others. He was the strongest in this decision. No one could contradict her. Challenge it. Because I did it out of love for myself. What if someone asked me why? I simply said: it makes me feel good. It makes me feel good. I want to see the sea. I had my father&#x27;s money for a few months. Time to actually be there. We spent 5 months here, and a month with his parents, whom I loved. His parents loved me too. I&#x27;m welcome there. More than at my parents&#x27; house. And now we&#x27;ve known each other for 9 months with T. C was obviously disgusted that I was leaving. And let T go. It was hard. It&#x27;s hard. But we plan to return to Paris. My father offers to help me find an apartment for T and me. If we do that we&#x27;ll have to pay. We&#x27;ll have to manage. We want to try. Even if we get confused sometimes, we consider ourselves lucky. We know that alone it won&#x27;t be any more fun. We know we have to heal. We know we can help each other. We want to be there for each other in this painful journey that is life. Above all, we know what a life without love is, and we reject that. But everything gets mixed up. We are afraid of getting lost. So scared. Maybe we&#x27;ve already gotten lost. That we live on memories. If so, at least we live. And we will recreate other memories. We do it every day. We make love. We get confused. We sleep and eat regardless. It feels good. It&#x27;s chaotic. It&#x27;s a <mark>blow</mark>job in the sea. It&#x27;s a kiss on the forehead when he sleeps. It is a gentle massage during menstruation. And I no longer have anorexia. I call my brother often. I&#x27;m talking to my friends again like I liked to do. But I don&#x27;t tattoo. I haven&#x27;t been able to do it for 9 months. Blocked. I&#x27;m afraid. So scared. What will happen? What is this hectic life? I need to transition. I am neither he nor she. My breasts my butt bother me. I want to be non-binary through and through. When will I be ready for this drastic change? How will I feel accepted in a society that rejects everything I represent?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I’ve just realized why my sister and I are struggling to get along after 5 years apart. Or at least I think so. 

We received different types of parenting which affected how we are in present day. I was expected to do everything right. I was punished for the smallest things in the form of being beaten up (which was somewhat acceptable in my society) which sometimes was extreme and left me bruised and really sore. I was punished for when my little sister did something wrong too because they said it was due to my influence. I was made to fear and respect my parents. If I talked back I would receive a beating. I couldn’t make my own choices of what I wanted to study in school. I couldn’t break curfew. I just couldn’t defend myself during arguments which were often physical and verbal. If I tried to 
defend myself I received a beating. I was badly emotionally abused by mum. There was a lot of emotional blackmail. I’m sure you sort of get it. 

My sister didn’t get into trouble as much. She was able to talk back and even speak her mind without being beaten almost to death as I would have. She had a choice of school, subjects etc. she basically could get what she wanted. I remember at the end of primary school I was threatened that I only have to get the best grades and I actually did I was top of the school. When her time came they gifted her and praised her for whatever she got. 

So basically I grew up being <mark>forced</mark> to do right, follow rules, being guided by fear. I’ve somewhat forgiven my parents for that but unfortunately it doesn’t change the fact that it has an effect on who I am today. I am someone who prefers to follow rules. Some may think then I’m uptight. I’m a medical doctor so it’s not bad that I want to follow rules. I’m more logical. I like to plan and I think about consequences. I also tend to try and fix things and come up with solutions. I’m always the one to make peace first and be the bigger person regardless of who was right or wrong. It’s rooted in how l grew up.

So I met my sister after years and years apart. So far we haven’t been getting along that great. I don’t think she realizes when she snaps at me or responds rudely or her body language is passive aggressive and she does that over actually talking about what’s wrong and trying to talk it over to smooth things out. It triggers me. When finally prompted she said I ruin everything, I am too fixated and boring and I need to relax. I’m too emotional and I <mark>blow</mark> things out of proportion. She had no sympathy or empathy at all when I broke down in tears and explained that I’ve not been doing great- I am stressed and burnt out and depressed at work, I’m not financially stable, I have gained nearly 3 stone because I’m not coping with healthy mechanisms and I’m just not in a good place. Work is physically and mentally taking a toll on me. I work really really long hours and that’s why sometimes I’m not up to do much or turn things down. Plus the money issue really is a thing. She later on with disgust on her face called it making a scene and being too much. I was shocked that she could be that cold to me.

I don’t know where I’m going with this but I’m just frustrated and I feel I’m being made out to be a terrible person due to things I can’t control. What’s worse is when I talk to my dad about it he said just be patient allow her to grow up. For context we’ll be 27 and 25 this year. She’s never been accountable on how her words and actions affect people she just gives silent treatment till you apologize first and when I told my dad she needs to be accountable and that he’s always defending her and never once defended me he ignored my messages. There’s now bad energy in the house and she’ll be here for another 3 weeks but yesterday I was fed up to an extent I asked my dad to facilitate her changing her ticket so she can leave this week. I don’t know her anymore and neither does she and I’m ok with the distance.

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m sorry if this turns into a rant, but I just have to <mark>blow</mark> of some steam right now.

A bit of backstory. Like the title says, I&#x27;ve had traumatic experiences in my past.
When I turned ten I switched to a secondary school, as is custom in my country. It was a way bigger class than I was used to and a lot of them were from a rougher part of town.
I can&#x27;t exactly pinpoint why it started, but me being the smallest and youngest probably didn&#x27;t help. Anyway, I started to get bullied - a lot.
Personally, I came to hate all these words for it. Just call it what it is: physical, mental and emotional abuse.
Everyday, I would get punched, kicked, insulted, degraded, ostracized, told that I don&#x27;t have any friends, I&#x27;m ugly, I&#x27;m unlovable.
It got really bad really fast. With eleven, I started to develop psychosomatic symptoms; I would always get these stomachaches when in school, that receded when I went home. Because of this I missed almost a whole schoolyear. I started to have suicidal thoughs and was depressed all the time.
Most of my peers and teachers just watched. What was probably the fear of becoming the next victim from my peers, or apathy from my teachers, felt like condonation, like I deserved what was happening to me.
It&#x27;s very hard to imagine if you didn&#x27;t go through with this yourself, but believe me, something like this fucks with your head in a major way, especially if you brain is currently developing your social skills.

For me, I got a nice little panic disorder out of it, as well as social phobias, and all those other little gimmicks: a bit of depression, trust issues, a complete lack of self-confidence and so on.

With 19, I was finally out of school and joined the work force, where people treated me more profesionally and respectfully. But I still suffered from anxiety and depression, and this limited my everyday life greatly.
I&#x27;ve finally had enough and looked for a therapist. Found one and went through months of therapy. Everyday I faced my worst fears, confronted them head on.
And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, I did get better at it, day by day. I was finally at a decent place, not a good place mind you, but decent enough for me and started to enjoy life!

Then, about two years later, I started to develop some health issues that greatly influenced my mental health. This hit me like a truck. I felt worse than I did for a long time. I was right back to square one.
I was fighting to get back on track but couldn&#x27;t manage. More and more suicidal toughts started popping up again and at the same time, Corona hit. Honestley, it was a bit of a blessing in disguise, being able to hide at home.

Finally, it got worse enough that I went to my doctor again. They prescribed me some light antidepressant/anxyolytic and recommended doing more therapy. I really wasn&#x27;t in the mood for even more therapy, since what I&#x27;ve learned the first time wasn&#x27;t really helping me anymore anyway, but I still tried. Called about a dozen, all of them booked out, none taking new clients (thanks &#x27;rona). So I just suffered on.

This brings me to today (and the title). I want you to picture it and tell me how my life sounds: I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and have a great job. Good salary and I enjoy doing it, plus I can work fully remote. I have multiple circles of friends that I all love very much, and a caring family. Volunteering  in my free time. Recently I also became a proud uncle!
Just this year, I&#x27;ve been canoeing in France, motorcycle trip to Italy, visited a festival for the first time, doing stuff with my friends every week and enjoying all my hobbies in between. A few weeks ago I was partying on saturday, and when I had to go they barely wouldn&#x27;t let me leave. I had two beatiful girls not leaving me alone, asking me to stay just a bit longer. The next day, we celebrated a friends birthday. He and his wife have a newborn and with some other friends there as well, and even some strangers I didn&#x27;t know, it still felt like a second family. And the day after that I invited my friends over, chilling, talking, watching a movie, it was a great evening.

If my teenage self could see me now, he wouldn&#x27;t believe it. He would think that I made it, that I have it all. But do you know what happened when I went to bed that evening? I just started crying, it was just too much. Because after all these years, this stuff is the best thing to happen to me, and it still takes everything out of me. In these times, I get lost in the moment, and for a brief few minutes, sometimes even a few hours, I&#x27;m happy. But it always comes back, the panic, the anxiety, and then life just starts tasting stale again. Then I just want to be alone, but I hate feeling lonely. And I&#x27;m angry, because all this is the fault of some fucking kids that couldn&#x27;t leave a fellow boy alone! And now this whole fucked up thing is my responsibilty! In these moments I just don&#x27;t want to exist anymore. What a blissful peace that would be.

And all my friends? They don&#x27;t even know about it. They think I have my life under control and thats just how I want it. Because whenever I tried to talk to someone about it, they don&#x27;t understand. And I don&#x27;t want this to sound edgy, but thats just the truth. To understand some things you just have to experience them yourself, and I&#x27;m happy they didn&#x27;t. And I have to admit, a part of me is proud of it too. I managed to make all those friends solely because of the person I am. I earned these relationships with hard work, and I want them to know me as the person I want to be.


This all got a bit longer than expected, so if you made it this far, thanks for letting me rant to you. Also, advice is not really needed. Should you be worried about me, I recently started a new (additional) antidepressant/anxyolytic and I remain hopeful that it will help. If this doesn&#x27;t work, me and my psychiatrist will just keep trying I guess. And maybe one day, I will truly be free. Until then, the next best thing will do.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">What a sad state of affairs we find ourselves in, brothers and sisters pitted against eachother in an idealogical war for a so called better world, a new world. 

Despite the bots and the government agents that litter these forums, the picture of this world is perfectly painted, with crayons, this world has become a childrens art class divided down the middle on the idea of what the best colour is, red or blue. 

I remember in my elementary days the teachers made a point of telling us how the colour purple was reserved for royalty, something to do with it being hard to mix the colours red and blue.... 

Here in canada, our legislation tells us that purple still ultimately rules the land, but we still have the brainless bickering over the red and the blue, in america however, you have been told that your imaginary lines were founded by defeating the colour purple, but if you look at who founded the imaginary lines, it should be clear that their allegiances always sided with the colour purple. 

The red lodge and the blue lodge, goofmasons... 

It is no secret that your so called nation was founded by these goofs, and it&#x27;s no secret that members of this cult answer to those at the top, the master goofsons, who come from the colour purple, those who claim royalty ultimately own freemasonry, again, this is no secret, look into it yourself. 

There are many different cults that infest high positions in all of our countries, we can see that the jesuits and the knights of malta founded the cia, we can see that freemasonry and the knights of columbus dominate our military and police forces, and if we truly understand how these organizations work then we know that they are not on our side, because this isn&#x27;t actually a war of colours, this is a war of us vs *them*, and they are winning this war by pitting us against us. 

So here I am hoping to show you, to show us, that if these so called leaders actually wanted the best for us, they would be doing things very differently... 

**We will start with the physical poisons.** 

It is no secret that flouride, the aluminum waste byproduct that is purposely put in our water, lowers our IQ&#x27;s, this is admitted to in various university studies, but still, no politician to this day ever talks about the possibility of removing it from our water and drink sources, they never talk about the various other drugs and chemicals found in our water either, a true benevolent government, would seek to eradicate this. 

Then we have the sugars, the salts and all else that is known to cause diabetes, heart problems, dependencies and et cetera, that is knowingly sold to our children and us, again, a true benevolent government would immediately eradicate these poisons that are known to weaken and harm society. 

Move on to monsanto and the likes, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and gmo&#x27;s that completely take over privately owned farmlands, it should be pretty obvious where much of the cancer and various other diseases come from, but has your favourite crayon ever mentioned this? 

Fast food, full of aborted fetus&#x27;s and hormones, also known to cause huge problems for us, from obesity to more disease, again never talked about... 

Don&#x27;t get me started on vaccine ingredients.

It can not be argued that these poisons don&#x27;t weaken us as a society, but it can be argued that either crayon wants us to be weak, and so we are... 

**The war on drugs.** 

Again, it is no secret(it&#x27;s almost as if there can&#x27;t be any secrets through some natural law), that the cia was heavily involved in the drug trade, and for my canadian friends, again, through the 5 eyes alliance it is no secret that our intelligence agencies work together, so clearly we can see how our own governments are bringing in the cocaines and heroins that plague our societys, a true leader would make this known to all, and they would end this immediately, but all of them follow the suites. 

If a government didn&#x27;t want people in *their* society to be hopelessly addicted to drugs and alcohol, then they wouldn&#x27;t allow the media to glorify the use of drugs in front of our children, there would not be another teen movie, there wouldn&#x27;t be a cheech and chong, there would not be another <mark>blow</mark> to society... 

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love ripping dingers and smoking joints as much as the next guy, but if cocaine were wiped off the face of the earth I wouldn&#x27;t shed any tears, I&#x27;ve seen many a people fall from it.

**The mental poisons** 

This is where *they* truly trap us, in the ists, isms and ions, this is where they get us fighting eachother, this is the great divide. 

These are the boxes we cling to, be it conservatism, liberalism, capitalism, communism and nationalism, these idealogies were all created by the *they* that we are at war with. 

We all see that this world has problems, but these ists and isms serve to divide the problems, they serve to divide us, they serve to convince us that these problems we face don&#x27;t all stem from one problem, from *them*... 

They truly are behind all the problems, from poverty to war to the modern day slavery that we find ourselves in, it is all manufactured by *them*. Just look at the Vietnam war, look at 9/11 both clearly stem from false flags, but does any politician this day ever mention this? No, they don&#x27;t. 

Look at ww1 and ww2, a little research shows that these wars were funded by the royals on both sides, we can see that hitler was heavily influenced by the thule society and the jesuits, the same jesuits that head every intelligence agency in the world. 

A true benevolent government would immediatly expose this, but they don&#x27;t. 

Then we have our religions, which simply serve as more great divides, again, a true leader would not allow this, they would seek to unite us, and not just those of us that reside in these imaginary lines, they would seek to unite the world, because there really is strength in numbers, so divided we have fallen... 

**Our Media.** 

Look at the television shows children are raised on, it is absolutely moronic, but still it is allowed on the airwaves, and so we sit our children in front of the teletubbies, while we wonder, where did we go wrong? 

I&#x27;ve already spoken about the degeneracy that plagues our movies and television shows, so let&#x27;s look at our music industry. 

Our music industry is raising a society of sluts and degenerates, from pop to rap, it&#x27;s all programming us to fail as a society, but does your dear crayon ever talk about this? 

No, neither crayon does... 

**Education** 

What does the education system churn out? 

Obedient slaves, trust the crayons we are told for over a decade of our lives, and so we do. 

I am a big fan of the open source philosophy that believes all information should be free, any true leader would agree. 

So that being said, all education should be free and easily accessable to all, but it&#x27;s not, instead people are going into a life of debt just to be able to get a decent paying job, which is no longer decent paying considering the debt. 

So if a so called leader fails to do anything about this, we can be sure once again that they are corrupt as fuck. 

**Corporate greed and resource depletion** 

When a corporation that operates world round tells us that clean drinking water is not our right, that corporation should be shut down immediately and their key players should be locked in zoo&#x27;s for life for crimes against humanity. 

Instead though, these types of corporations are allowed to sell their no longer clean products in every single little town world wide, and the more of it we buy, the better we are told this mythical economy is doing, buy, buy buy little consumer. 

This is not just companies like nestle at fault, it is also our oil and gas corporations, our forestry corporations, our power corporations, they are all bleeding this world dry with complete immunity. 

Instead of keeping our resources local, we ship them all over the world risking large spills and other pollutants that are literally destroying the environment and its inhabitants, even though every contintent has these resources already. 

Then there is the problem with these corporations exploiting labour from 3rd world countries, to make our pretty shoes and our pretty shirts and our fancy black mirror tracking devices, but we pay no mind, because after many generations we have been taught to only care about ourselves, again, a true leader would...

**Banking and the Monetary System.** 

Well, in my eyes this is a given, but clearly in the pit it isn&#x27;t, so many bots, agents and useful idiots cheering on the current crayon for making america goofs again, or whatever maga stands for... 

But yeah, banking and the monetary system, another head of the beast system that enslaves us. 

Banking has long surpassed the day where it just stored money, now it creates money out of thin air, be it by bank transactions, loan interest, or just adding digital zero&#x27;s to whomever&#x27;s account it pleases, but it does not please us. 

Banking is another good example of how the purple crayons are in control in all our countries, because if you look at the the top positions in the top banks, you will find various ancient bloodlines at the top such as the houses of torlonia and colonna, and if you look up the torlonian poem of long ago you can see that they view us as lower than dogs... 

So this system that allows the select few to print unlimited money out of thin air needs to change, and again, if the politician doesn&#x27;t address this.... 

**On and on we go, where we stop, I know** 

People fear change, we are very habitual creatures you see, we all have our habits and routines that we stick to, so it is in no way a suprise that people fear this new world order that we keep hearing about, problem is though, there is nothing new under the sun, so this new world order that our politicians and the likes tell us about, is nothing new whatsoever, this system that enslaves us has been around for 3000+ years, the only thing that&#x27;s changing is the level of control. As technology advances, so does does the control, and my fuck if that isn&#x27;t getting scary as fuck, but we need to stop fearing change... 

Sure, fear and oppose *their* new world order, but don&#x27;t be scared to help create *our* new world order, because we certaintly need one, and we need you, each and everyone of you is needed to fix our world. 

They say change comes from within, and I agree to a slight extent, real change though, it can only come from within the collective conscience, and right now the collective concience is as fractured and divided as its ever been and this is all because we give in to the parasitic purple crayon that has coloured this world red and blue.... 

Politics and therefor democracy, is fake as fuck, it&#x27;s all just theater and actors play fighting on the not so grand stage, but behind the stage, they are all partying with the likes of the epstains and saviles. 

Until this is realised, we are on the road to destruction... 

The solution here is to make this known to people while also coming up with something actually new under the sun, and that is a system that allows all to live free and easy. 

The choice is yours folks, what the fuck are you gonna do?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This is gonna be seriously fucking long for those of you who don’t enjoy reading. I don’t think a TL;DR would seriously do this whole mess justice so I apologize to those of you who aren’t able to read the whole thing. I’ll be happy to answer questions in the comments, even if the answer to said questions are in this post. Thanks.  

For some context, I work at a gas station and I work with about 6 other people. I had somewhat of a spat with one of them in which the resulting fighting and disagreements has lead to the current situation I’ve been air dropped into. 

The incident in question happened during one of my usual night shifts with a coworker who (while she did mostly nights) preferred working days with one of our other coworkers. Besties and all that clique-y high school crap. We’ll call them R (the one I fought with) and D (her friend/our coworker).

Earlier that day our store got a truck delivery, which is just when we get product to replenish the store for all you non-retail folk. It was the work weeks second truck day and on second truck days the truck tends to come later the day, leaving most of the truck left for the night shift to sort and stock. 

I had come in around 2 and got to work on the truck. I finished all but two totes of the dry/non-walk-in cooler stuff when my boss (we’ll call her P) asked if I wanted D to come in on her day off to help stock the walk-in cooler totes. I normally wouldn’t have said yes, but because of business hours being changed (thanks COVID) and being left with less hours in the shift, I agreed. 

Fast forward an hour, R comes in, I start making the next days breakfast and she hops onto the main register. Now, R has had issues in the past with being on her phone too much. I don’t mean like the typical boomer shit, I mean she was taking calls while ringing out customers, making tik toks when she’s supposed to be working, that sort of thing. 

I’m halfway through breakfast when I look up and notice she hasn’t moved from main register in about an hour. I decide I’ll just politely suggest  her to do work. 

Me: Hey, R, do you think you could finish up the dry totes out there when you get a minute? D is coming in to help with the walk-in and I just don’t wanna leave her more work than necessary. 

R: Yeah that’s fine, I can do that.

Me: Cool, thank you. 

I go back to the breakfast figuring she’ll get to it soon since she isn’t doing anything else. Look up about 10 minutes later and I find her reorganizing the Bic lighters by color, something that she does quite a bit to pass off as her “working”. That’s when I decided to walk over. 

Me: Hey um... what are you doing?

R: I’m reorganizing the lighters... why?

Me: Well, it’s just that the dry totes are more important and they need to get done fir-

R: Alright, I’ll fucking do it. 

My head has been bitten off. I’m peeved. The main reason I’m peeved? This has been a consistent problem with R. She does not have initiative to do work, and in the past, rather than make her do the work, I’ve done it by myself and kept my mouth shut. So the one and only time I ever decide to be more forceful about her doing work, she snaps on me like I’m interrupting her discovering the cure for cancer? Not gonna fly. 

I zip my lip and get back to the breakfast, just pushing through my work so I can call my boss (P) and sort this whole situation out through her. 

The next half an hour of silence between us ends up being broken when D shows up to do the walk-in. R immediately drags her outside to start venting about what happened. I keep my mouth shut and don’t speak to either of them unless I absolutely have to. 

Now, D and I had been fairly decent friends. Hung out a bit outside of work, chat about our personal lives, shit like that. I can tell she is more friendly with R and than she is with me. To the point where her nickname for R is “mini me”.

So I immediately assume she takes R’s side. I end up not really speaking to her or our other coworker (calling him F) for about two weeks. 

End of the two weeks, find out R has to go to Florida for about 2 weeks. This puts her out of work for 6 weeks, having to stay in a 2 week quarantine for the trip there and the trip back. 

The whole time she’s gone I finally begin opening up to D and F again, explaining to them what exactly happened. I was expecting them to understand my side and make a better judgment call of the situation rather than try to get involved in it directly. 

Nope. 

F completely shuts down anytime I bring it up. Won’t comment, won’t respond, won’t even look at me. 

D fakes a neutral stance while still defending R with R’s “shitty home life.” Because apparently having outside of work problems excused you for everything. We all have shit to deal with. 

Around the same time of the incident, D told me she wasn’t going to be hanging out with anyone outside of work anymore. She meant this for everyone we work with. And even before this I had no luck at all in trying to hang out with F outside of work. Always either too busy, too tired or a combination of the both. 

Fast forward to just this past Sunday. The 14th. 

R has come back from Florida and has to be in another 2 week quarantine from work. 

I’m working the register when R, D, and F come through the door. None of whom are wearing a mask. R doesn’t talk to me, D and F don’t talk to me either. I keep my cool and ring them out and get them out of the store. I decided to immediately text my boss (P) asking if she’s even allowed in the store without a mask, let alone allowed outside when she should be quarantined. 

P is livid, and a quick side note, she is the best fucking boss I’ve ever had. She has been with me and let me actually talk about this whole mess while still giving me advice and resources on how to deal with it. Anyway, she is NOT happy at all that R is back. 

For one, R had told her she’d be coming back on the 15th, not the 14th. And for two, R was supposed to be in quarantine. Florida has been seeing a huge rise in cases since they’ve started lifting lockdowns. She could be an asymptomatic carrier and not even know it. 

P tells me to disinfect and wipe down anything she touched, which luckily was just the card reader when she bought herself gas. I go back to work and pretty much just brush it off as nothing huge. 

Later that night D and F come back in, this time without R. They immediately come over and ask me how I’m holding up, if I’m doing okay. Which... to be completely honest, took me off guard. I was fine and I told them I was fine. They both seemed happy to see me and I was happy to see them for the most part. I tried to ignore the fact of them still being friends with R because the whole incident was just between us and I didn’t want that to affect their friendship. 

They leave and my other coworker (calling him T) comes back from doing the garbage to tell me that while he was over by their car, he not only saw R sitting in it, but heard her shout out the window:

“Glad I’m not working with you after everything you put me through.”

I had to fucking laugh. She spent numerous nights just trying to fuck with me. Calling up her friends and indirectly cussing me out, implying I don’t do my work, bitching to everyone about how shitty I am. The same exact time I spent just not talking and doing all my work. 

I decide to hit up F with a text, because I know he’s in the car with her. 

Me: Hey. You know T sometimes likes to tell people things that other people have said in order to start shit or cause drama?

F: Yeah... why?

Me: Alright. It’s nothing. 

F: No, what is it?

Me: Don’t worry about it, go have fun. 

F: I will. Because I don’t let what other people say or do affect or change my world. 

Me: Sure. 

We haven’t texted since. I could tell he knew what I was talking about and I didn’t want to escalate the situation further than it already had. 

It had me thinking the whole rest of the night. 

They’ve been hanging out with R. REGULARLY hanging out with R as if nothing ever happened. Treating her like a friend, talking to her, all that stupid bullshit. 

What have they done to me? Nothing. Less than nothing. I haven’t hung out with either of them since, took two weeks before I felt like I could open up to them and when I do they <mark>blow</mark> me off. 

Every action, every choice, every single fucking thing they have done since the fight has done nothing but make it appear as if they are taking her over me. 

I’ve had it. I’ve fucking had it. The level of unequal treatment they present while still trying to claim they’re being neutral and just don’t wanna get involved... it’s ridiculous. 

The incident and subsequent incidents influenced a decision I was hesitant on before, that being moving into an apartment with my current boyfriend. I’ve realized the place I’m working, and the town I’m living in no longer makes me happy. 

I don’t look forward to work anymore. I don’t enjoy seeing my coworkers like I used to. My home life is getting more and more tense as the lockdowns and quarantine persist. 

After coming back from my boyfriends today it became painfully obvious that in order to GENUINELY be happy, I need to be with him. 

It will take time and it’ll take a lot of saved up money, but I’m determined to better myself now. I’m determined to give myself the happiness I deserve. 

Thanks again for reading all that.</div>

*This post was written last year*

Assalamualaikum,

So I was really reluctant to post this, but here goes…

My city was celebrating Pride Week last month. Their rainbow flags and stickers were everywhere. Everybody was really making a big deal out of it. The most upsetting thing was seeing the rainbow flag at a kids school! That weekend, I really didn’t even want to step out of my apartment. 

For some months now, I have been volunteering at the Islamic Center to help the poor and the needy. We were helping orphans and those less fortunate. And they wouldn’t stop needing help just because these people over  here wanted to celebrate their “pride”. So I went.

I went; Knowing my subway route would come close to the pride paraders. I would just have to do my best to avoid them. 

In my experience these folks act so overly lustful and provocative. They make it a point to be loud and flamboyant. Some of these people(both male and female) wear short shorts exposing their asscheeks. They march around proudly in the presence of teens and preteens. They say shit like: Yasss queen! Get it gurrrl! They do trashy actions like twerking and making duckfaces at random people. They usually take selfies with their tongues out to show everyone what they’re all about. I am not too fond of people like this.

While I waited at the train station, my childhood memories of being terrified of chakkas and hijras

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)

 were coming back to me. They are also known as khusras ( in some regions. I hated how they would walk from car to car in heavy traffic; sexually harassing passengers till you had to pay them to go away. Even rolling up the window would be of no use against the aggressive tactics of these moneyhungry, drugaddicted animals. Filthy beings! They were absolutely repulsive! Yuck!

Soon, the train arrived. There were only a handful of passengers. I sat close to the exit. The trip would take a little over half an hour. I began to relax and anticipate the day ahead. The trip would usually take 30-35 minutes. On the speakers, a voice announced that passengers should expect delays because of the parade. I was expecting to be there in half an hour but now it would take almost an hour thanks to this Pride nonsense. Ugh! These people were already ruining my day with their stupid and pointless parade. This whole thing was all just an exercise in “Oh come and look at us march from point A to B while we act super duper mega gay”. These people were making such a mockery of the concept of Marching. Marching should be an action reserved for military activity. 

It started getting more crowded as the train went on its route. It was already hot and the smell of sweaty people was in the air. I was so grateful to be sitting by the exit. At least I could get some fresh air when the doors opened at each stop.

Eventually, a crew of Pride parade participants decided to sit in the seats next to me and around me. It was a mixed group of males and females. One of them stood out because of his sheer size and muscularity. He was sitting across from me, a well built African American gentleman. His hairstyle was cornrows. He had tattoos all over his torso and arms. He even had visible neck tattoos. He looked like a really tough bouncer and he was definitely a roider. I would later hear his friends call him Rhino. He was one of those muscular gay guys. By the way he handled himself and his demeanour, I had a feeling he had been to prison.

Holding his hand  was a skinny white teenage boy. I could only describe him as James Charles but even more gay if that’s possible. They were whispering to each other, showing affection  and occasionally kissing. Disgusting!

They were accompanied by a quartet of what I call “Ghetto sistas”. These were seated next to me. They were some real hoodrat types. You know what I’m talking about. Imagine bootleg versions of Cardi B, Nicki Manaj, Kim Kardashian. That’s approximately what I was looking at. They all looked like they had ass implants, lip injections, nosejobs, lipo…. You name it; these hoes had done it and more. Women that do these things end up looking like apes and baboons as they age.

Standing by them were two gangsta rap looking dudes. They both had neck and face tats. The black one had a durag and a gold teeth grill. The other, a light skin mixed race, had some weird rainbow braids. He was looking like one of those lil pump, tekashi 69 type of people. Basically, they were just a bunch of tryhard lames.

 These guys were obviously not concerned with being productive members of society or looking presentable at job interviews. There was a good chance that they were drug dealers and following the parade. Selling their wares here would net easy profits.

 That was the only explanation for them being there because they looked totally out of place. This was not the natural environment for these type of guys. 

On the other side, standing near Rhino and his boytoy were a bunch of teenage high school kids attending the parade.  For two of them; I couldn’t even tell if it was a boy or a girl. Yikes! 

 Because I saw them all talking to each other and since they all entered the train at the same stop; It was clear that  all of the above were part of the same group and knew each other. 

“Happy Pride” I heard someone say all of a sudden. It was one of the ghetto sistas looking at me. I hestitated. “uhh..same to you”, I replied awkwardly. Her bloodshot eyes made it obvious that she was high.  She smelled of stale beer.

“Wuss wrong? u got a prolem wid pride or sumfin?” 

“No, no problem. Enjoy yourself at the march” I told her with the fakest smile I could muster. 

That shut her up for a minute. Weird ass attention ho! Why was she trying to make a scene? What a moron! 

All of a sudden she was trying to hand me a Rainbow colored pride scarf saying, “Yo, why donchu put this on for your head thing”. I can’t believe this ignorant ho was referring to my Hijab as “your headthing”. Stupid creature!

 “No thank you.” I replied politely. She was meanmuggin me hard (making a threatening or menacing facial expression). She tried to lock eyes with me like she thought she was tough or something. I saw right through her facade. Her other friends were telling her to calm down “Take care of your friend” I told the group. Implying she was acting reckless under the influence. Her friends told her to sit down away from me in a different seat. 

That calmed things down for a few minutes. Then all of a sudden, I saw one of the high school boys was walking in my direction holding the very same scarf. Guess he was planning to put it on my head, thinking it would impress his buddies.

“Sit yo ass back down lil man” I told him. This was not my usual way of speaking. I was sending a message: Do not mess with me! In situations like these: never show weakness. I was speaking his language. Showing him I’m not some little pushover. Just from the look on my face, the kid understood I meant business. This is not someone you wanna mess with. I’m not the one you wanna be playin with, kid.

He went back to his friends. He was smiling real hard, trying to compensate for feeling so embarrassed. They were glancing in my direction every few seconds while speaking to each other.

 One of the other highschool kids took up the challenge to put that stupid scarf on my head. I stopped him before he even stepped in my direction. “What’s your problem buddy?” 

“Miss! We juss tryn to help u out miss. We try an make u look fly n shit knamean?” 

“Come near me and you will go *flying* through the air. You got it?” Ok, that was corny but it’s all I could think of and a few people laughed. He went back to his friends.

I wanted nothing more than to be left alone. Unfortunately, these idiots had decided to use me as a form of entertainment on this boring train ride.

Next, the rainbow dreads guy approached me and whispered “You smell real good ma” Ewwww!  I made a face at him like I wanted to vomit. My face looked like I had just smelt the nastiest piece of shit on Earth (him). “lemme see wat u workin wid under dem jeans gurrl” he continued, undeterred.  Yuck! 

I decided to go to the other corner of the train car. These people were so nasty! Scum of the Earth! As I stood up to walk away the guy grabbed my arm saying “where u goin ma”. That was the last straw! I pushed him off me so hard he fell to the floor. 

The fattest Cardi B lookin bitch who was meanmuggin me earlier saw this as a perfect opportunity to hit me. She stood up and lunged at me but she lost her balance and slipped. She fell hitting her face against the edge of the hard seat. She didn’t account for the train still being in motion and swaying from side to side. Serves you right, you dumbass bitch.

Everyone was mad now. They didn’t need another excuse to beat me up. One of her fellow ghetto bitches shouted “Lets stomp this bitch out” Other voices joined in:  “Let’s fuck her up”, “Fuckin bitch!” “You gonna die bitch”

 This was mob mentality! They all surrounded me.

“BACK THE FUCK UP BITCH! BACK THE FUCK UP!” I screamed at them.

They were startled at this and some of them  moved back a few feet or froze. I wasn’t even thinking anymore. I was operation on pure instinct. I was on autopilot. I balled up my fists and held both my arms out to the side. Then, I began to spin in circles.


“What is she doing?” I heard someone say. I was still spinning . My speed was only accelerating now. It became clear that I wasn’t slowing down. They must have understood what was happening now. This was like a tornado before their eyes. Coming close to me was like putting your fingers in the spinning blades of a blender. 

“Get her!” screamed one of them and they all lunged at me in unison but they were immediately repelled by my Tornado Fists which sent them flying and knocking over their comrades like dominos. The first wave of attackers was down. I stopped spinning and tried to reorient myself from the dizziness.  

The rainbow dread guy suddenly came at me, trying to sucker punch me but I managed to duck out of the way. 

Now there’s something you should know. Most of you reading this; Like  99.99 % of you do not know how to throw a punch properly. In fact if you were <mark>forced</mark> to punch with all your might there is a good chance you would break your wrist or your fingers. I’m not saying this to diss because I too was once like this But not anymore. 

Not since I have been taking MMA classes and working under a coach for almost a year now. I don’t plan to ever compete in MMA but I enjoy improving my skills. Another advantage I have is that I’m ambidextrous. I can fight on either side and punch just as well with other hand. My favourite aspect of training MMA is improving my punching power.

Back to the train. The rainbow dread guy had no idea what he was in for. He almost managed to land a punch because I was dizzy. I quickly regained my footing. He was going to pay for this. 

Before he even knew what was happening; I jumped on him and attacked him with a flurry of kicks and punches. It was brutal barrage of non stop <mark>blow</mark>s and kicks from every direction. You may have heard of the expression “Raining cats and dogs”. For him, It was raining fists and punches. 

After almost a full minute of this, I stopped. Everyone around was shocked and in silence. I looked around at all the chaos and injured people. They were the same ones who wanted to “stomp me out”. Look at them now, humiliated and injured! 

The few remaining were not looking for a fight anymore. Only the  toughest of them all, Rhino was standing across from me. He hadn’t gotten involved. He had been standing back and watching silently. 

We looked at each other. Was he going to try and beat me up? “I aint gon fight no female” he said, looking to the floor. I put my guard down.  Wise choice, Rhino. Wise choice.

Everyone calmed down a little and things got quieted down, I got off at the next stop and decided to turn around and go back home. I couldn’t go to volunteer looking like this. My fists were bloody, my clothes and shoes looked ruined and scuffed up. On top of all that; my phone screen was cracked! I had just bought this Galaxy S10 phone and now it was ruined.

I almost became a victim of mob violence that day. I’m thankful to Allah SWT for blessing me with the ability to defend myself. And thanks for nothing Pride Parade! 

In the following days, It didn’t come as a surprise to learn that there had been major brawls during pride parades across the country and across the world.  It was a literal parade of scantily clad, <mark>drunk</mark> and drugged out shameless people strutting their sins and peddling their filth to children. Why this is seen as a movement of love and positivity, I will never understand. 

Take care and Assalamualaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/mdj2w5/my_dysfunctional_family_a_story_that_i_cant_fully/" target="_blank" class="title">My dysfunctional family ... a story that I can&#x27;t fully understand</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">this is a story I want to tell because growing up into adulthood I saw my original family slowly disintegrate. Assuming that at the age of 25 I moved to a different state from my family, I experienced some of the facts partially, although emotionally involved, but let&#x27;s start from the beginning.I remember a happy and carefree childhood up to the age of 14 ... when things started to slowly break out. My mother&#x27;s equilibrium erupted with the death of my grandparents, which happened quickly within 6 months of each other.

At the same time my sister also started to get worse. It must be said that my sister was never an easy child. she has been anorexic at age 8, at twelve she stopped washing herself and locked herself in the house and soon after she attempted suicide by swallowing all the medicines she found at home after which my sister was admitted to the children psychiatric hospital where they wanted to keep her for a period, but my mother against the opinion of doctors and my father decided to take her home. My parents after that started taking my sister to the child psychiatrist. Now I have a partial memory of these facts because at that age I started high school, and I have many memories that concern myself. I do remember, however, that my parents once asked me to attend a family session and I refused.

My mother with great effort finally managed to re-introduce my sister to school. Unfortunately the only school that accepted my sister after the dramatic events was a school very far from where we lived, which meant that my sister had to be accompanied every morning around 6 and my mother picked her up at the end of class. Many times, however, this changed in the fact that my mother waited for my sister in the car for the duration of the lessons because the distance did not allow her to return home and then have to come back there. From this moment on began the series of right and wrong sacrifices that my mother made towards my sister.

I have confused memories of that period, because some are very happy moments, new friendships, the beginning of adolescence, but I also remember having a great attraction for rebellion, I remember <mark>sleeping</mark> in squats and going big raves. I remember that my father was always very absent, and easily irritable and aggressive. I remember that he worked a lot and that when he was at home he was intractable.However, my sister finally started high school too, if the first year went smoothly enough with normal friendships and a presumed sense of stability but soon after things got worse again. During her second year of high school, she met some new friends who introduced her to smoke a lot of weed, and when I say a lot of weed I mean a lot of weed. I remember that it was also around the same time that my sister began to be bulimic, I remember that we found vomit all over the house. And I remember my mother becoming more and more obese, what I think now is that my mother was more and more crushed by the facts I remember that she became almost totally passive at this point. I remember she passed 50 euros daily to my sister which she obviously used to buy weed. Weed quickly turned into cocaine and alcohol, and things got worse every year.

At this point I must have been around 17 years old and I was living partially at a friend&#x27;s house when I could. Which, although it seems absurd in a sense, I think it has helped me to develop a fairly balanced personality. I remember that although I slept on the sofas here and there, I did very well at school and that I always knew how to get by in a certain sense. I had my friends, who were my family, the people I could count on. The relationship with my father was bad for me at that time, I remember he screaming at me every time he saw me, now I understand in hindsight, it&#x27;s clearly not easy to accept that one of your children practically lives away from home as such young age, but in a way I think it was an unconscious selfdefense from the extremely toxic situation that existed in my house.

At that time the drama of cocaine and alcohol also broke out, my parents finally discovered that my sister was highly addicted after my sister was hospitalised in an alcoholic coma on vacation where she was staying. So I remember that my parents had to go and get her on the plane to take her home, and after that my mother had a great nervous breakdown. I remember that my mother cried every day, and that every little situation could be the reason to make her break out, I remember that she never left the house and that she closed herself in an antisocial shell. In that period, I was around 18 at the time I remember getting totally involved in the situation and trying hard to save my sister and my family. I decided that from then on I would try to help my sister out of substance addiction. .

I had no idea what that meant. how much pain I had to suffer and how much better help from a professional would have been instead of an 18-year-old inexperienced with good intentions. But my parents at that moment were no longer able to react, my mother was totally destroyed and intractable, my father was incapacitated by the situation and I got it into my head that I wanted to save everyone.

I talked a lot with my sister for years, I learned about collective rape, furious mobbing, absurd situations. I took my sister everywhere, always with me to give her support, show her new situations, people, influence her in a different way. But clearly it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought, my sister is not a stable person, and over and over she got <mark>drunk</mark> to monstrous levels, getting violent with me and my friends, to the point that one after another my friends started walking away and avoiding me because they wanted nothing to do with a highly toxic person and a poor stupid young woman who thought she could change things with love. My mother and my father exploited the situation by putting all the responsibility on me. Every time I wanted to do something, they psychologically <mark>forced</mark> me to take my sister with me, who clearly managed to create situations at limit, every time. And as I said if the first two years I did it willingly but when my own life begins to change and lose my friends, I wanted to take a break, dedicate time to my social life as well. I moved from home and began to distance myself slightly trying to recover some of what I had lost. The loss of my friends was really big to me from which I think I have never fully recovered.

In the meantime, I graduated from university and started working as a freelance artist. With good success. I totally dedicated myself to my work, it was both an outlet and a pleasure at the same time.Living out of the house, I had time to dedicate to myself and recreate a new stability. I had new friends, everything was new, I found myself involved in a fairly normal life. But part of me continued to follow the dramatic events of my family. I remember that few times my sister came to my house and  made some monstrous scenes, yelling, beating me and screaming and leaving me destroyed. At the same time my parents turned against me, calling me selfish because I was absorbed in my new life and job, and that I had betrayed them and left them in trouble. Which created and still creates numerous feelings of guilt in me to today. Around the age of 25 I met a man who is now my partner and we fell madly in love. Living in another state and having been in a long-distance relationship for a year we decided to move together and start our life.

I remember when I returned home to tell my family and that on that occasion my sister and I decided to go out for a dinner together. I remember that we went to a very nice and trendy fish restaurant and that the evening soon took a totally negative turn. I remember that my sister was totally irritated and nervous when we went out and <mark>blow</mark> out in a burst of anger, I don&#x27;t remember what the cause was. I remember she beating me wildly in the street, I remember my blood, I remember people screaming from the windows to stop. I remember someone maybe calling the police, I remember taking the opportunity to run, fast, faster and faster, I remember crying.

The next day I went to a psychiatrist for myself for the first time. She told me that I had to accept to detach myself totally and devote myself to my life, which seemed far-fetched to me at the time but instead was very wise advice, looking back today. By moving to another state, things became very different for me. slowly I regained the truth in myself and became a happy person again.

I remember finally getting the news that we all always thought: my sister&#x27;s first diagnosis as bipolar, which then became a diagnosis of borderline disorder. I remember that every time I tried to contact my family during these years, I received tragic tales of the things that were happening. I remember once my sister attacked my mother with a knife. I remember that my parents bought her a house a few meters from them, I remember that my sister refused for years to take the medicines that were prescribed to her. I remember that from this point on began the great adventure of the continuous change of psychiatrists, every three or four months. I remember my mother more and more destroyed, now totally antisocial, smoking 2/3 packs of cigarettes a day.

Every time I came home it was a tragedy, when I was traveling with my partner, honestly slightly less, but if alone, the whole drama took place worse every time. Until the second suicide attempt of my sister two years ago.

I remember my father calling me in the middle of the summer and giving me the news that my sister had tried again, so I decided to take a plane and leave to offer my support. I managed to book for the following week, when I arrived at my parents&#x27; house the situation was somewhat surreal. my sister lived at my parents for the time after the accident and when i met her she was clearly in a weird emotional state, she laughed and looked like she was on drugs. She also had a strange asymptomatic fever of 40. And she was laughing and talking in a strange state. During the same week I decided to see some old friends from the university. When I was in the car, messages began to arrive from my sister. About how she was  dating  this guy and that he was HIV positive, and that they had unprotected sex together. Well the same week it happened she had fever and fever to the point that my parents bridged her to the hospital and the day before I left the news arrived. My sister was HIV positive too. I cried, oh I cried a lot.. I know that HIV diagnosis does not mean anything dangerous nowadays, but I don&#x27;t know that for me it was like the culmination of years of pain and tragedy.

The last day before my departure I had a big argument with my sister and we haven&#x27;t spoken to each other since. I took the plane and went home. That was the last time I saw my family. After that I suffered from PTSD for a year and then took care of myself, and then with COVID it was no longer possible to travel.

In a way, COVID lockdown has given me the opportunity to focus on myself, on the person I love and emotionally resolve parts of the relationship I have with my past. I&#x27;m afraid to see them again, even though I obviously miss them.

What I can no longer understand are my emotions about it, I know that in the past I suffered a lot, I cried, I was desperate. But I don&#x27;t feel like that anymore, I feel empty when I hear the tragic news on the phone ... I&#x27;m not involved. Is it normal? My sister had a car accident yesterday and in the meantime my parents are experiencing a great marital crisis because my mother found out about my father&#x27;s lover and three years of double life.

I honestly don&#x27;t know what to think ... I&#x27;m tired and numb ... and I have a hard time contacting them even though I&#x27;m very sorry. The most absurd thing is that I never thought this could happen ... and I have a damned fear of what will happen in the future. But my focus now is my personal family with my partner, I feel like an idiot sometimes when I dream of simple things like a dog and save money to build my house with my partner.He doesn&#x27;t like me talking about my past, that&#x27;s why I write here, I write to see it in black and white... everything that has happened in recent years and what it means both for me and in general.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This was a long time coming. We started having issues in high school and over the past 12 years its gotten worse.

She got involved with the wrong crowd (drugs. Alcohol. Seedy friends doing and influencing her to do sketchy stuff ... stealing, lying, the works.)

I tried to rein her in and help her, I knew something was wrong when stuff from our family home started to go missing. My dad had money here and there disappearing, I had things in my sock drawer go missing. One day our dad came down on us because he had a massive amount of money &quot;go missing&quot;... 

Things were weird. Something was weird with my sister and I desperately tried to tell my dad that my she was up to something and he refused to hear me. He even at one point accused me of stealing his money.

One afternoon we went to take my sister lunch at her workplace and found out she was lying about where she worked. She made up who she was with, where she was, she made up an entire story and refused to come home for a few weeks.

It was an entire fiasco. At that moment my dad realized I was right-- my sister had some serious issues going on and I had been trying to tell him something was wrong for months and he had refused to believe me. I was in college at the time and in the middle of finals when it was going down at home.

My dad and sister were in a huge fight, private investigators were hired to track her, and the cops were called to see what my dads options where-- my sister, legally, had committed grand larseny and could face jail time. 

 $50,000 of our fathers retirement fund was stole  and spent it on multiple car purchases, a flying squirrel (you read that right) and she started cage dancing at local clubs for extra cash.

That is really tough stuff. Like how could you forget about that. Thats HEAVY.

Fast forward 9 years and I cannot unsee the stunt she pulled. I have some large resentments toward her because our dad is widowed and hes not a weathly man. 

/She /stole/ part of his retirement, she destroyed our family dynamic, obliterated any kind of trust I had in her, i was <mark>forced</mark> to move away from home when I didn&#x27;t have money saved and live on scraps because I was afraid my things were going to get stolen and there were cops and detectives coming and going.

To this day I do not trust her... at all.

I dont know if I ever will trust her again. 

We have tried to fix our relationship again and again and each time I try to move forward she <mark>blow</mark>s up on me. Everything is always dramatic, everything is always about how I offended her and how I hurt her and how I opprese her and I don&#x27;t give her a chance and live in the past.

She offered to go to therapy together and fix things but she refuses to help me look for a therapist. Or help pay for it. Or understand that the stuff I needed to work through was heavy, dark stuff that may potentially not be able to be forgiven or worked through. She single handedly destroyed our bond as sisters and it was completely her fault. And not ONCE has she ever truely apologized for anything even after explaining my feelings to her. All comversation always went back to how upset SHE is at ME.

Now fast forward to the end: she happen to catch me on a very bad day... I had a pounding migraine, I had just had surgery, and also got a notice that my rent was sky rocketing and Ive been pretty freaked out that we would lose our place to live (while she sits unemployed at home paying nearly nothing and not struggling at all at nearly 30.)

 I was already mad before this conversation because she didnt show up to my wedding shower... My friend paid for her food. We paid for her way to come, sent her the expensive fancy invite because she specifically said she wanted to go and she no-showed because &quot;she couldnt get it off work&quot; (she had 6 months, 3 months, and weeks notice and reminders). So yes... I was pretty livid before we started arguing.

She decided to start an argument with me that day that I needed to accept her friend request on facebook and I didnt have a right to be upset with her over my wedding shower, and that she tries so hard to have a relationship with her sister and I only ever see the bad in her and that I was being unreasonable (PG version. She said a lot mote colorful things than that).

I told her I needed space and to please leave me alone because it wasnt a good time. She wouldnt let it go. Before I knew it I snapped at her... i told her she is a toxic person and I never wanted to talk to her again and to stay away from me because she was stressing me out. I had enough on my plate and it wasnt my responsibility to appease her and constantly attempt to include her to have a no-show. It wasnt my job to make her happy and to take her drama elsewhere because I wasn&#x27;t having it anymore.

I was absolutely rough on her but I got fed up with trying to make a relationship with my sister work. Its constant negativity and drama. Constant BS and let downs. Also when someone asks you for space and you ignore a boundry thats not cool. Even worse if you piss off someone who suffers from migraines. If I ask you to drop it-- you drop it.

 Would anyone else react the way I did in this situation? Was it justified that I got upset? What does reddit think.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">To understand the story fully, it’s best if I start from the beginning.

Before I started seeing my current girlfriend, I was in a relationship with another girl—someone I was actually planning to propose to. But just two weeks before I was going to do it, she cheated on me. Not long after that, my two best friends decided to walk away from me as well, saying I had become “unbearable” and that I was “hurting their image.”

All of that hit me hard, and I barely recovered from it. I was all alone, no girl, no friends...

Seven months after being cheated on, I started a relationship with my current girlfriend. I didn’t have any prejudice, trust issues, or fear—just a certain emotional distance until I felt safe enough to open up and believe she was someone I could truly trust. She, on the other hand, jumped into the relationship with 100% from day one, and during the first month it already felt like we had been together for a year. I didn’t mind it, but I knew deep down that it wasn’t a good sign.

She kept pushing me to tell her I loved her, but I understood the weight those words carry, so I struggled with saying them. During that period—from January to May—I took my father to the emergency room at least ten times. At one point, I literally watched him on the edge of dying, and that left a deep, paralyzing fear in me. She knew all of this, of course, but it seemed like she didn’t fully grasp how terrified I was… though to be fair, I never really talked about it openly, either.

A bit later, I went to a party where I took ecstasy, and in that emotional rush I told her over the phone that I loved her. In that moment, I knew I had essentially given her the upper hand—I knew she would now have the power to influence me however she wanted. Still, I hoped it might push our relationship in a healthier direction. By then, we had only been together for five months.

The next day, right after the party, I found out my dad had cancer. And that’s when everything started falling apart. My worst fears became real, and I suddenly had no idea what was going to happen to him…

Three days later, I was at a friend’s place watching a movie. Around midnight, she texted me saying she was going to sleep, and we exchanged our usual goodnight messages. Two hours later, I headed home, and just as I was about to text her, she messaged me first.

“Why didn’t you send me any messages? You know I love waking up and reading what you wrote,” and so on.

The truth is, I was about to text her—she messaged me literally ten seconds before I typed out my “heading home” message. And from that night on, everything started going downhill.

I explained to her that if she had slept just two minutes longer, she would’ve woken up to five messages from me: something like “Just left,” “The movie was good,” “I’ll be home soon,” etc. But she didn’t want to hear any of it. She just cried on the phone. I kept trying to calm her down, explaining that it was just a matter of timing, that she didn’t need to worry.

I understood the situation perfectly—but she clearly didn’t.

I begged her to let us go to sleep because early in the morning I had to take my dad to the hospital, and I had no idea what to expect there. I needed every bit of rest I could get. But she just stayed silent and kept crying on the phone.

We stayed on the call the entire night—me begging her to sleep, her crying. In the end, I didn’t sleep at all, and I went with my father to another city for his hospital appointment completely exhausted.

It wouldn’t have been such a big problem if the exact same thing didn’t happen again a week later. The exact same scenario.

From that moment, the arguments began—just three days after I told her I loved her, and three days after finding out about my dad’s illness.

I completely shut down. I wasn’t okay at all. That was the point when I should’ve gone to a psychiatrist, but I didn’t want to put additional stress on my family, so I kept everything to myself. I stayed quiet, endured it, and replayed everything in my head over and over.

I won’t lie—that period hurt me deeply. The person who was supposed to be there for me suddenly disappeared emotionally and started fighting with me over every insignificant thing. Over problems that weren’t even real. I understand that, at some point, she convinced herself our relationship was in danger because I started to pull back—but that wasn’t true. I pulled back because I couldn’t handle anything anymore. I wasn’t avoiding her, I didn’t stop loving her—I was just drained and couldn’t deal with imagined problems on top of the real ones.

Ex cheating, losing my two best friends, and my father’s health crisis—and her inability to understand any of it—**all happened within the span of a single year**.

That phase lasted for about a year. For four months, it was really dark—I genuinely wasn’t okay. The other eight months were unstable, full of ups and downs. We kept arguing over completely trivial things… like me not telling her something right away, not sharing some random gossip, tiny details that meant absolutely nothing and would have changed nothing.

Whenever there was a problem and I was the cause, it was always my fault. However, when she created an issue, it was always blamed on “poor communication” or “the situation,” never on her. She never wanted to admit her own mistakes. I could barely get her to acknowledge them, and maybe she only admitted fault in two or three situations.

On the other hand, whenever I messed up, I would go to her within an hour, take full responsibility, admit my mistake, and sincerely apologize.

She never once connected my behavior to what was happening with my father. Instead, she made it all about “us,” as if I had distanced myself from her or stopped caring, when in reality I just couldn’t take the constant arguments and the stress she was creating in her own head.

I wasn’t the best partner. There were many times when she cried while I just sat there and looked at her. Sometimes she would cry before falling asleep, and I would simply turn my back and go to sleep. I didn’t know how to fix any of it back then—and that hurts me deeply today. It hurts knowing how much pain I caused, how much I failed her, how much of an idiot I was for not knowing better, for not being stronger, for not being there the way I should have been.

I explained everything to her—that we were fine, that I was struggling because of my dad, that I just needed some time to get myself together mentally. But she dismissed all of it and kept saying something felt “off” between us.

ALL OF THIS OVER A TEXT MESSAGE.

A TEXT MESSAGE THAT—IF SHE HAD WAITED TEN MORE SECONDS—WOULDN’T HAVE LED TO ANY OF THIS.

After that, we somehow managed to get back on our feet again, but I still didn’t feel okay. The arguments continued, though not as often as before—back then, we fought several times a day. She was trying to fix things, putting in effort, and I was just… existing. I was still living in fear.

Now I had an additional fear on top of everything: if she could twist everything around and make it all about her during the hardest moment of my life, what would happen next time? What would the future look like?

We “fixed” things on the surface, but nothing was really fixed. The foundation was still damaged. I became cold and distant. I didn’t even recognize myself. The version of me that existed during that period wasn’t the real me at all.

I stayed in the relationship because I truly believed things could be repaired, that we could get better, because I genuinely loved her. Even the things she did that irritated me or exhausted me didn’t erase my love for her.

At one point, she saw a joke between me and a friend about another girl, and she got seriously hurt by it. Looking back now, I understand completely—it was wrong on my part. If the situation had been reversed, I would’ve reacted the same way she did.

For us, it was just a stupid joke. For her, it was painful.

After that, sex became dull. It barely even happened anymore. There was no spark, no fire—because she was still hurt.

I had my own needs, and I’m not someone who cheats or goes behind my partner’s back. I loved her. So when I felt that urge and we weren’t intimate, I turned to pornography. My mindset was simple: as soon as things between us get better, I’ll stop and give all my energy back to her.

One night, while we were asleep, she woke up, took my phone, and went through everything—every message, every tab, every detail. She saw my search history and what I had been watching. And for her, that was a massive <mark>blow</mark>. That was in March this year.

That led to a huge fight. It came down to one choice: either I “fix myself” and become a better man, or we break up.

That was my wake-up call. I knew I could do better. I knew I *was* better. I had never been a cold person. I&#x27;ve always loved with my whole heart and tried to be the best partner I could. During that dark period, she kept telling me that she knew I was capable of more, and deep down, I knew it too. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t pull myself out of it.

After that fight, I made a decision: I had to snap out of it.  
And I did.

The change was noticeable. I genuinely felt better, the relationship was improving, and everything finally seemed to be moving in a positive direction. I quit smoking cigarettes, cut down on weed, and really started putting effort into becoming a better man. She even complimented me, telling me she felt better too — that she could see how much I had changed and that it made her happy.

But then, out of nowhere, in August, she told me she wasn’t feeling the best about us. She said she had doubts — whether we were right for each other, whether she could see a future with me. She brought up the argument from March, saying it was too much for her and that we should’ve broken up back then.

I felt completely blindsided. After everything I had worked so hard to change — after all the effort, the growth, the calmness — it suddenly felt like none of it mattered. Like everything I had been building just collapsed in a second.

Despite that, I told her not to rush, that I had gone through a similar phase before, and that we could get through this together if we both put in the effort.

And now, just ten days ago, she decided it was over. She said she loves me and sees that I’m fully committed, that she notices my love, that I’ve become a better person, and that I’m completely honest—but she can’t continue the relationship.

We still talk a little. She sends me a message, I send one back, but I can feel the distance she’s creating.

I told her I’m not willing to give up on her—not after everything, not after she pushed me to change. And if she had wanted me to just let her go, she never should have pushed me to become a better person in the first place.

I don’t want it to seem like I’ve only spoken badly about her. She is the best person I have ever met. Every night before bed for the past three years, without fail, she has prayed. She’s kind, friendly, beautiful, and on top of all that, very grounded. She understands true values and knows how to separate right from wrong. She is the only person I can vouch for, knowing she would never betray a partner.

She experienced her parents’ divorce as a child, and I understand that, in a way, it contributed to her struggles during that period. She felt a certain “distance,” and I get that it was difficult for her and painful. Out of fear, she probably acted the way she did. Even though I held it against her for a long time, shortly before that fight, I had fully forgiven her.

And now I don’t know what to do.  
I don’t know whether to let her go, or even *how* to let her go. I love her deeply, and being with her feels right to me.

When she told me it was truly over, I got completely <mark>drunk</mark>, telling myself, *this is it—you have to let her go*. For two nights straight, I drowned myself in alcohol and took medication to calm myself down, trying to force myself to accept it. But I couldn’t convince myself. Not at all.

And the thing is—I hadn’t had a drink in over four years.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">My boyfriend and I have been together for about nine months. We’re both teens, but he’s a bit older. He’s had a really difficult home life for as long as I’ve known him. His parents constantly put him down — not in the “strict parent” way, but in ways that go after who he is as a person. They regularly call him stupid, hopeless, and worthless. As well as that he’s told me about physical abuse when he was younger, including an incident that left him with permanent damage. I always knew his home wasn’t a safe or healthy environment, but things started getting worse over time.

He’s been wanting to move out for months, partly to protect his own mental health and partly because he just doesn’t feel at home in his own house. At first, we thought he might temporarily stay with me and my parents, but we live in a very small apartment and it just wasn’t realistic to suddenly add another person into the mix. So the plan became to wait until I graduated.

But his parents’ behavior kept escalating. Whenever he stayed at my place a day longer than expected, they would <mark>blow</mark> up at him. Even if they knew he was with me, they wanted constant updates on exactly what he was doing, and any slip — even something as small as forgetting to tell them we went grocery shopping — turned into a huge fight. It was suffocating him and putting a lot of strain on our relationship because he was constantly anxious about whether he’d “done something wrong” again.

Eventually, we both realized that waiting another year and a half wasn’t going to work. He needed space now. So he started looking for his own apartment. He didn’t tell his parents right away because he knew how they would react, and he wasn’t wrong — he was scared things would explode, because they always do, even just for small things like missing a bus.

He was offered a place pretty quickly. When he went to see it, it felt perfect to him — the kind of space where he could finally breathe. He signed the contract, and his move-in date is coming up soon. His grandma  and his siblings has been supportive and understanding, and his sibling is the one who told him he should tell his parents sooner rather than later, because waiting would only make them angrier.

So he told his mom he had gone to a showing. She got extremely upset right away. She told him he couldn’t manage on his own, that they wouldn’t help him with anything because he “hid things,” that he had made a huge mistake. He sent them a long, respectful message apologizing for not involving them earlier and explaining the situation more clearly — a message his grandma even looked over before he sent it — but they ignored him completely.

Then today he woke up to 24 missed calls from his mom and one from his dad, plus a text saying she would keep calling until he picked up, and that if he didn’t answer, they would come physically get him. She also told him he wasn’t allowed to respond by text and had to call, or she would delete their entire message history.

When he finally called, they were furious. They told him he had changed, that they didn’t recognize him anymore, that he didn’t talk like himself. They insisted that the words he used “weren’t his,” that they had to be coming from someone else. They didn’t say my name, but everything pointed directly at me — that I was somehow controlling him, influencing him, changing him, putting ideas in his head. His older sibling later confirmed this is exactly what they believe.

It hurt hearing that, not because I believe any of it, but because I feel like they are the ones being controlling. I’ve been trying to support him in making his own choices, even when those choices weren’t the ones I would have made. For example, when he told them over text, I actually said it might be better to do it in person. I don’t try to speak for him and I wasn’t even in the room when he made the call. I’ve just been trying to be there for someone who has been deeply hurt by the people who are supposed to love him the most.

The worst part is that they told him they want to look into his contract to see if there’s a way to cancel it, like they want to undo his progress and pull him back under their control. He tried to calmly set small boundaries, like wanting to take the train home by himself because being “picked up” felt humiliating and <mark>forced</mark>, and his mom snapped at him again saying the words didn’t sound like him and that he was &quot;part of their family&quot; as if that erased his right to make his own decisions.

Now he’s on his way home because they insisted, and I’m sitting here scared and stressed and honestly a little sick to my stomach. I’m afraid they’re going to pressure him until he breaks and maybe even force him to leave me, just like they did with one of his exes. I don’t like being painted as this horrible influence when all I’ve done is try to be someone he can rely on when everything else feels hostile or unpredictable.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t know how to support him without making things worse, and I don’t know where the line is between being there for him and getting caught in the middle of a family dynamic that’s way bigger and more toxic than anything I’ve ever dealt with before.

Any advice or perspective would really help. I feel really lost right now.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">So a bit of a background. 
My parents (mostly my mother) were very physically abusive growing up as well as verbally and emotionally. 
Some things she did were:
Throw a chair at me with enough force to open a hole in the cabinet behind me
Threaten me and my baby brother with a knife, drawing it to our wrists
Yell at me and slap me for hours until my legs were red and swollen
Calling me names because I didn’t want to go to Japan for college
Shove me to the ground for little to no reason
Etc

In addition to direct abuse their negligence got me sexually assaulted when I was very young and that’s a can of worms I don’t want to open. 

Most of these things she did to me when I was not even 9 years old. 
When I was 23 I opened up to my father to let him know I do remember the abuse and that I hate my mother for it and his response was to minimize and deflect blame from his wife. “She was stressed” “we weren’t perfect but we tried our best” “your mom’s mom was an alcoholic and way worse” 
I decided that if they weren’t going to take accountability then I’ll just be hurt again and again if I stay in contact with them. Also I have no feeling of love towards them. I’ve not contacted them in 7 years and felt good about the fact. I’ve grown more as a person in these 7 years away from my parents toxic influence than in 23 years of being in contact with them. 
I still keep up with the rest of the family but they’re really bad about respecting people’s boundaries. 
For example, they flew me out to a family vacation last year which I was grateful for but they “forgot” to mention my father would attend. They knew well enough that I would not have attended had I known he would be there. It took everything in me to not <mark>blow</mark> up in anger at my aunts, who organized the trip. 
And just today I called my grandmother to wish her a happy Mother’s Day and she started spouting bs about “I think your parents are just confused and don’t know what they did wrong :(((“ and “your parents are flawed people and you’re a very forgiving person uwu :((((“ 
It took so much restraint not to start crashing out at her. I also think my parents are trying to manipulate her into saying these things because I’m in a very vulnerable position right now (my kidneys failed). 
I have always felt so much anger and hatred towards my parents. So much so that I know when they die I’d be celebrating. And now I’m angry at my grandmother too. But the problem is, she doesnt have much years left and I want her to have a nice happy last couple of years of life. But at the same time I shouldn’t have to open myself up to someone who is a manipulative toxic violent piece of psychopath trash in order to make sure my grandma is happy. What do I do???</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I need advice but also I just need to vent so I&#x27;m not really sorry if this isn&#x27;t written very nicely (ie run on sentences/not enough or any paragraphs, spelling issues) this is basically a diary entry but I also need advice. My (24f) best friend Winnie (fake name 23f) and I have been friends for 15 yrs we met at 9 and have been inseparable even when I moved states away we bumped into each other again at 19 and found out we lived in the same town not even 10 min away. Yesterday morning I ended the friendship, I wasn&#x27;t even going to do that at least I wasn&#x27;t hoping it was going to come to that so suddenly I wanted to try and talk to her about quite a few issues we had in our friendship namely the drug abuse and the paranoia I felt from her. I want to preface that she can be really sweet and really nice but as we all know hard drugs and mental illness doesn&#x27;t mix well.

Background knowledge: we both suffer from suicide ideation I myself have gone on suicide watch several times and I&#x27;ve even taken her to it before and stayed with her the whole day/night. We both have bpd and bipolar, I have taken steps to get better and so has she but the difference is she&#x27;s still in the self sabotaging stage. Every step she takes she goes back two and I really feel like the drugs are playing into that not to mention she&#x27;s in a really toxic situationship with an ex so that plays a big part in her journey as well. I&#x27;ve tried getting her to cut him off several times he gets her so wound up that she has had several breakdowns and has looked me in the eyes and told me she&#x27;ll end it if he moved on. For honestly a good two maybe three years her issues were my issues and I would non stop talk about it with my bf or would stress over her future. This summer her mental health had gotten pretty bad she even told me she was going to end it before summer was over which put my anxiety and paranoia through the roof. I would spam call her every time she turned off her location, I constantly would breakdown thinking about what it&#x27;s going to be like for me to have to bury my childhood friend, I even told her I don&#x27;t want to do that. She&#x27;d brush off my worries.

The past two years she hasn&#x27;t changed or made any progress on her healing journey. She constantly gets into crisis mode and doesn&#x27;t know how to desecalate herself, I have even mentioned to her that she needs a safety plan and more support because it&#x27;s affecting myself and my bf. My bf can&#x27;t even lean on me for his mental health issues because she takes up so much support from me. I have felt guilty over that but I also know that no matter how much support I give her (ie leaving work early or abandoning one on one time with bf) she hasn&#x27;t gotten better and it&#x27;s been affecting me mentally. I feel like myself I&#x27;ve been going backwards which infuriates me cuz I&#x27;ve done so much to get to the point where I&#x27;m at. 

But god the guilt. Cuz I know it&#x27;s the drugs and I know it&#x27;s the toxic ppl she surrounds herself with and if she just stopped surrounding herself with bad influences she&#x27;d be better she&#x27;d be healthier and she&#x27;d be less selfish and it be like the old times. Sunday night I had actually asked her if she&#x27;d be open to a talk and said it was super important to me. I realized I needed to have another talk cuz here she was telling me she did molly after she already did some shrooms (it was like the microdosing chocolate bar she had half another friend had the other half) on Saturday. And she&#x27;s telling me she got the Molly from some rando at a concert (hello we both know to test our shit and her situationship dude has a really advance test equipment that can test Molly, coke, and other shit so no excuse honestly) and telling me not to worry cuz she only took enough to enjoy the music. Her drug use has gotten to the point that she actually thinks things like coming down from Molly doesn&#x27;t affect her.

That night she texted me apologizing for always roping me into her shit and then proceeded to warn me she&#x27;s going to be super depressed. I cried I was tired I was drained that day and I realized I&#x27;ve been drained. So I wrote up an outline of everything I wanted to talk about and told her I wanted to talk. I&#x27;m constantly overthinking what I say to her in text and I never myself like the text &quot;we need to talk&quot; so I had told her that I needed to talk about my mental health and that I understand I&#x27;m her main source of support but I needed to have this conversation. Which is true part of the conversation I wanted to have was that this is affecting me mentally. My paranoia and anxiety and breakdowns have been so fucking frequent. She said sure and we made plans to talk the next morning.

The next morning I wake up and I text her as like a reminder that we needed to have this conversation (she is constantly forgetful and has often times had to miss the things we were suppose to do because she either forgot and sleeps in or forgot and double booked). She tells me she&#x27;s incredibly low (yes cuz of the Molly) then asks me if I wanna reset my brain with her. Immediately I&#x27;m like &quot;no way this bitch is talking about doing fucking drugs&quot; but I don&#x27;t want to be rude or assume or <mark>blow</mark> up so I tell her no that&#x27;s super vague and not a good selling point but that I can pick her up and we can talk. She then tells me, not asks but tells me it&#x27;s going to wait til tomorrow cuz she&#x27;s &quot;tripping balls rn&quot; I was done at that point I was shaking and sobbing because are you serious? I know that I can&#x27;t just spontaneously ask her to be here present with me so that&#x27;s why I planned ahead I asked the night before, I even reminded her. In that moment I felt like I did everything I was suppose to and she still found a way not to prioritize me. And I snapped I told her I was done I told her she needed to lay off the drugs and I sent her the outline of what I really wanted to talk about. Today I assume she&#x27;s sober but she hasn&#x27;t messaged me at all. 

I&#x27;m hurt and upset she&#x27;s picked drugs over our friendship a 15 yr long friendship! But I also wonder if I did enough if I tried hard enough. Maybe I shouldve been yelling at her instead of being gentle, I was just and still am scared she would stop being my friend if I gave her tough love. She&#x27;s even admitted when ppl tell her not to do something she will do it even if it was sound and just advice. And I feel like I&#x27;m looking down on her it&#x27;s not like I haven&#x27;t myself stuck powder up my nose before, like how dare I cut her only support she has while she&#x27;s going through this, what kind of person does that? But then I think about everything she&#x27;s put me through and I get tired and I cry more. I felt like for the past year at the very least I&#x27;ve been seeing her as a walking corpse. Like the decisions she keeps making are just gonna put her in a casket and she&#x27;s told me several times that she has wanted that and I get it I wanna kill myself too sometimes. 

And that&#x27;s another reason why I feel guilty I know she&#x27;s in a dark place she&#x27;s been there for awhile now, but it just feels like no matter what I do she just wants to stay there. And I get angry cuz what am I suppose to do then? It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m <mark>forced</mark> to either keep being by her side knowing she&#x27;s going to kill herself or leave and hope maybe me walking away is a wake up call. And this wasn&#x27;t like a spontaneous BPD split I had on her for 8 months I&#x27;ve been mulling over in my head what I should do about our friendship because I knew it wasn&#x27;t healthy, I felt like though that text I got was a sign she isn&#x27;t going to change with me being present in her life. I know that no matter how hard I spiral it will be worse b/c of the drugs especially since she was literally tripping when I ended the friendhsip. We have a mutual friend that I told her today I needed her to be there for her, refused to go into details cuz I told her I wanted her to be there for Winnie with unbiased support and afterwards I would possibly vent to her, I have my man though Winnie doesn&#x27;t have anyone other than us that genuinely want what&#x27;s best for her. I feel like though despite even making sure she still has support through this I haven&#x27;t done enough. I haven&#x27;t tried enough.

So I guess my question is how does everyone keep living without their best friend? How do you keep moving on when you&#x27;ve had to cut someone off you love so much because they&#x27;re decisions are affecting you? Is there any way to ease the guilt? And if anyone has a story where they had to cut someone out but they came back and were better I would like to hear that story, sorry for the long worded vent but I honestly dont know how to ask for this advice w/o venting</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Previous posts for context-Post 1-[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/194zdh2/update\_my\_biological\_father\_44m\_who\_left\_me\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/194zdh2/update_my_biological_father_44m_who_left_me_when/)Post 2-[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1ad6ffw/my\_18m\_biological\_fathers\_44m\_family\_wants\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ad6ffw/my_18m_biological_fathers_44m_family_wants_to/)

Well, sort of good news first, I went to a psychiatrist after a lot of probing from both the people in my life and people online who recommended I try therapy. And after a couple of sessions I was diagnosed with BPD along with a Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I’m not going to lie and say I took it well. I screamed and cried and threw things around and it took my boyfriend, my guardian and adopted father James along with the psychiatrist to calm me down after about an hour of me just yelling at everyone around me. I even tried to climb out of the window but given the room was on the fourth floor of the building, I don’t think I would have made it far. It took about 3 guys to hold me down and sedate me. I was put on some meds right after and there were even talks about having me committed but they decided to wait until a few more days or weeks to see if I got worse. They said that the antidepressant will take a few weeks to fully work but that the Xanax should work really quickly after taking it. Bad news, combined they make really fucking sleepy and tired and after what happened, I was knocked out for a good day and woke up like half and hour ago. I’m also sort of documentation everything here so that I can remember what happened to this best of my abilities because these fucking meds are also going to mess with my memory so I am really not winning at life right now. I feel sort of numb and tired and I can’t even tell if it’s because of the meds or my apparently numerous mental issues but it will take about a month to see. I’m taking at least a few weeks off of college to figure this out and there’s nothing for me to do but ride it out I guess. I’m trying to learn about what I have but all I know is what I managed to retain by quizzing my friend who’s studying to be a psychiatrist. I’m a fucking English Literature major with a minor in Journalism and all these big words are hurting my head. I don’t think I’ll be very coherent but honestly, my mind is somehow the sharpest when I’m writing so this is the best it’s going to get.​

&amp;#x200B;

But that being said, that’s not the whole reason why I posted again. Anyone with a working brain could figure out I had issues so I don’t think anyone’s going to be super surprised that I was diagnosed with something so quickly. Maybe not the specifics but that’s not the reason I posted. My bio dad, who I’m going to call DH (short for Dick Head) because that asshole doesn’t deserve to be called my father. That’s going to James from now on. Seeing on paper how badly my childhood screwed me up because of him just confirmed that I never want to see him again. I hope I maintain this position after my mind has cleared a bit but right now, I hate him. I hate him like I’ve never hated anyone before and for good reason. I didn’t even get to tell him that, since I’ve barely been able to string along a coherent sentence but James did and from what I know it didn’t go good. James even had to tell DH that if he ever tried to come near me again, he’d get a restraining order and that anything that happened to him on our property would be considered self defence.​

&amp;#x200B;

Well, DH never tried to contact me again but he did tell his own family about me, just as one last ‘fuck you’ before he left again. His family is apparently incredibly abusive and horrible, to everyone in it. His spite or whatever was stronger than his feelings towards the very same people who abused him. They ruined his life and he was more than okay with them ruining mine even more than it already is. He tried to leave me with them before, when I was like 7 or 8 but I threw the biggest tantrum ever and he was <mark>forced</mark> to keep me with him. The reason why I threw the tantrum was because when we reached their house, I could hear a woman or a child screaming for help in the house along with things breaking and yelling about some other stuff. It scared me so much, I refused to get out of the car and even tried to run away from him when he tried to drag me to the house. He gave up and took me home and then left a couple months later for good. He even told me how horrible they were to him growing up and he still told them about me.They showed up at my home and thank the stars James was there because I was not in the right state to handle them. I was literally rotting on the couch in the living room trying not to fall asleep at 12 in the afternoon when they came. James wanted to close the door on them but they managed to make their way in after saying they just wanted to meet me. I tried to be present for the conversation but I was honestly having an out of body experience the whole time and was more focused on the show playing on the TV than what they were saying but I did pick up some stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

​Like 5 of them came, and apparently, it’s a whole blended family. Aunts, cousins and uncles all living together in a giant house left behind by some ancestor. They are decently well-off but not to the same level James is. I can’t fully remember but I think there was a cousin just a bit older than me, another who was a whole decade older than me and an aunt and two uncles. I’ve literally never met these people in my life and they were acting so concerned over me. James made sure none of them sat close to me and told them that they had 10 minutes to make their sales pitch and then leave. The older uncle said that DH had told them about me for the first time and wanted to meet me. The aunt chimed in saying something about how tall I was for a girl but that was the only time I spoke when I told her I was a boy. She laughed and said that DH never said if I was a boy or girl and that they couldn’t tell with my hair. I just sunk further into the blanket and let James handle the rest.​

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, DH leaving them was a massive <mark>blow</mark> to their ego and ‘family pride’ and if they could get his kid back into the fold, it would prove they weren’t terrible people who abuse their own children. As you can guess, James was not the biggest fan of the idea that I go and live with them because ‘they’re family’ and ‘they needed to take care of me since I was obviously not doing well’. Well, after one of the cousins, the older one I think, made a comment about ‘exotic’ I look (I’m mixed race with my mom having Japanese and Chinese heritage) which did give me shivers even with how detached I was from the entire conversation, James got ready to kick them out. They were making some really creepy comments towards me the entire time and when one of them tried to touch me, James had to physically push them out. He said he made a mistake letting them in and he’s going to do his best to rectify that and learn from it going on. They’re basically on the No Contact List along with DH now. I was half asleep at this point and there was yelling about how he can’t keep me away from family and that I ‘needed to be fixed’. Whether they were talking about my blatant homosexuality or my slowly but steadily declining mental state is yet to be confirmed but fingers crossed, I never talk with them again to find out. I could hear them from outside the gates about how James has ‘turned me to his disgusting ways and turned me against my own blood. James was fully ready to call the cops when they left and asked if I wanted pizza after.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, my mind is fucked, my biological father is a piece of shit (surprise surprise) and his family are a bunch of child abusing, molesting, homophobic freaks who think that I want to live with them. I’m don&#x27;t, incase that wasn’t insanely obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest problem now is that I don’t think any of the people are going to be happy with my decision to never want to have a relationship with any of them again. The fact that DH is talking to his family about me again pisses me off even more and they do have a lot of influence (how none of them have ever gone to prison before as far as I can tell), and combined with how messed up I am, I’m vaguely concerned that they might pull some shit to get to me. I’m half considering making them all sit down in a restaurant and giving a powerpoint presentation on why I wouldn’t even trust them to take care of a turnip and that I have no interest in any of them. None of them seem like they would respect my wishes to just be left alone if I told them nicely so I don&#x27;t know at this point. I just need some advice on how to deal with them going forward, like let them tire themselves out or just outright try to block them from my life?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">TW: mentions of abuse. 

Im audhd and sometimes struggle understanding people. I asked my aunt if she thinks my mom should leave her husband because I wanted to see which side she was truly on (explained later) and my aunt did everything she could to say no without verbally saying no. She said it’s been so long since they’ve been married (almost 9 years) and that the judge would ask why did my mom stay so long and what was it that pushed her to divorce. She said that all the things he’s been doing, he has been doing it since the beginning and that there’s nothing new that he’s done that my mom can use as a reason for divorce. She also said you have to weigh the pros and the cons, and that he’s been there when she needed him (financially) and the petty things he does isn’t enough of a reason. To me, this seems like manipulation because the things that he has done is bad enough for anyone else with a healthy mindset to leave. It seems like my aunt is trying to say no without saying no because she has her own reasons she knows would be inappropriate to say. I can’t tell if I’m <mark>blow</mark>ing it out of proportion or not because I have a history of doing so, so is it how it seems or am I reading too much into it?

For context, my mom and aunt are super close however if you look at them, you can tell my mom is closer to my aunt and my aunt really doesn’t care all that much about my mom. It’s very much older sibling <mark>forced</mark> to hang out with younger sibling so they make the younger sibling do whatever they want and the younger sibling just things they’re getting along even though they’re being treated like a slave. My aunt is older than my mom. For the longest my aunt has taken advantage of my mom, because my mom has a wrong yet strong belief that because my aunt is her sister, she wouldn’t do anything to harm her yet throughout their entire lives up to now my aunt has been using my mom like a bank. My aunt has more money and way better credit than my mom because my aunt has my mom pay for everything and put everything on her credit. So whenever she is saying to do something there’s always a hidden motive that will benefit her and not always the person. 

My mom has only been around toxic people who enable her toxic behaviors and encourage her to stay with toxic people, if someone is trying to be a positive influence she will find a way to cut them off or in my case try to break them mentally. She doesn’t really listen. To reason she only trusts whatever my aunt says because she thinks that since my aunt is older, she’s wiser, and should know better, and that my aunt is always thinking of her best interest when that is very much not the case. She also only listens to people that enable her own toxic behavior. 

My mom is currently married to a narcissistic asshole. Him and my aunt are very alike and my aunt gets along with him more than with my mom even though my aunt “talks badly” of him it’s obvious she kinda favors him over my mom. My moms husband is truly horrible to us, he uses classic narcissistic tactics to break down my mom little by little. He’s emotionally, mentally, physically, finically and sexually abusive. He’s burnt my mom out to the point where she believes she can’t survive without him and that she can’t do any better than him, and he’s even beaten her down to the point where he essentially pavloved her into responding however he wants so he can win arguments. He’s been worse to me basically locking me in my room throughout my teen years, only able to go to school, says it was my fault he cheated on my mom (I was a minor at the time), has physically assaulted me before, and has starved me for days on end when my mom had to go on business trips.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">My formerly extremely slim mom (F45) started dating a “feeder” (M39) a few years ago and is getting huge , What do I do ?

How to help my mom (F45) out . Ever since my mom got her new boyfriend Shane (M39 )about 5 years ago I’ve noticed she was starting to gain weight fast , She was always extremely thin and had barely any fat on her , I didn’t know what to think of it but she sat me down recently and told me how she’s going to get much much bigger as shane is what you call a feeder and wants her to gain more weight as he likes bigger women . He has now gotten her to start taking mass gainer protein shakes very regularly like I always see her drinking it probably 3-4 times a day Now I’ve seen Shane’s exes before and they’re all like formerly super slim women who got huge and that scares me . Constantly I see shane bringing he cheese cakes as he knows that’s her favorite and not like slices the man is buying her whole cheese cakes and that lasts her like 2 days and he’s now starting making comments how that outfits getting so tight on you we’d have to buy you new clothes and he’s like always rubbing her stomach now and squeezing her and bringing her seconds after she finishes eating . It’s just scary because my mom was formerly so slim and trim and now she’s gaining weight like crazy she told me that she’s planning on reaching around 200–230 and stopping but I feel like that’s a lie as she’s now readily enjoying gaining weight , thing is my mom has high blood pressure so you can see the weight gain is really affecting her. She’s always huffing and puffing now . Shane is very slim and loves from my mom to sit on him and just recently I overheard him saying to her when she sat on him oh, she’s getting so fat and overweight and pretty soon he won’t be able to take her weight anymore and that he cannot wait to hold his woman when she’s gains some more weight and she was gassing him up saying how she’s going to get so huge she’ll suffocate him. I really don’t feel like shane is a good influence on my mom as she’s really gullible and is putting her Health at risk she doesn’t even do her daily workouts anymore and has now opted to over eating consistently and she’s <mark>blow</mark>ing up help life is now junk food and honestly the public displays of affection is really annoying because Shane’s always grabbing her fattier areas and always trying to make her a “jiggle “ . She’s now sporting a full on gigantic gut that just spills over all her clothes now and it doesn’t help that she wears tight older clothes more as her arms and boobs are now extremely huge as well 
And they weren’t before i’ve tried to talk to her several times on this matter, and she told me it’s her body

TLDR - My mom started dating this guy named Shane who’s forcing her in the 5 years they’ve been together to gain massive amounts of weight</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14zkyro/a_year_ago_my_parents_forced_me_to_choose_my/" target="_blank" class="title">a year ago my parents <mark>forced</mark> me to choose my university and now i dont know what to do</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">im really sorry if this is too long or if it feels like im going around the point. i swear i dont mean to rant. its just a long story.

so. im 19 years old. last year, i had my end of year exams which essentially are the sole deciding factor on whether or not you go to university. they are a HUGE deal in my country. afterschool tutoring, stopping your entire life for a full year so you can study etc. it was a really difficult year for me. i went out once a month. after easter holidays i didnt even go to school so i could study. it was a year that i genuinely felt i was wasting my life despite how important the exams are, full of anxiety and breakdowns. but it was all worth it, right? you have to study subjects in a way that sucks all the interest and enjoyment out of them, but it meant that as long as i succeeded, in uni i could study whatever i wanted to study. well, i did great at the exams. i even got perfect grades in chemistry.

some context: my parents are teachers. meaning, we have a steady income, though not a very significant one. we could afford my tutoring, though it was a pretty severe <mark>blow</mark> and i constantly felt guilt for all the money we spent on it. i actually think that that guilt was one of my main motivations to study. i couldn&#x27;t waste all that money. 

my sister is two years older than me. she also sat those exams and she also had tutoring, though she didn&#x27;t really get good marks, meaning the universities she could enter were very limited. in the end she chose (with my parents&#x27; influence) civil engineering in a town with a population of about 50k people. the city we grew up in has over double that population.

so i understood during that entire difficult year that i was going to have to go to the same town. i knew we didn&#x27;t have that much money, i knew that me going there was the easiest for my parents, and it was a kind of comfort - even if i failed horrendously at my exams i could go there.

however, my mom told me again and again, no, you will choose whatever university you want, whatever city you want. she said we could afford it. &quot;my parents made sure me and my brother studied on one paycheck in the 80s, we can do it now with 2 paychecks&quot; she knew ive always wanted to study in a big city, specifically the capital, because whenever we go there i love it so much. i was still choosing between universities at the time, mostly because i didn&#x27;t know how well id do.

after the exams, we were in the car with my mom and she said &quot; the capital is too expensive and its too far away, its better for us you go to city b&quot; i was a bit sad but at the end of the day that city is also way bigger than the one i lived in, and at the time i had decided i wanted to go to chem school, and that city does have chem school so i was happy to accept.

a week later, i was out eating with my parents and it all changed. suddenly &quot;go wherever you want, we can take it&quot; became &quot;you will go to THAT town in THAT uni&quot; the same town my sister was studying at, and i would be studying electrical engineering.

and thats how the worst summer of my life began. i swear to god, the amount of yelling that happened in our house. it was nonstop psychological blackmail. &quot;if you go to city b youd have to go there by train every day is that what ou want? no youll go there&quot; &quot;youll be a waitress&quot; &quot; at chem youll only end up as a teacher&quot; but it was never discussed really. like, they said all those things about taking the train to the city or getting a roommate but it was never discussed as a real possibility that might happen. it was just to make me scared. i was afraid theyd choose my university for me so i hid the codes you need to apply officially. and when it was time to actually apply. oh my god.

id decided with a lot of hate in my heart for the decision that i would go to electrical engineering. i could have secretly put chem in, i wish i would have now, but i was scared my parents wouldnt give me any money, not for rent, or bills, and ive never gotten a job before. and when it was time to actually apply there was again so much yelling, because i didnt want to apply to any other schools since i was sure to get into that one, but no my parents arent happy if theyre not controlling every. single. thing. about my life. i remember my mom just grabbing me by the ears and pulling. i had been angry that entire summer and now just thinking about it im getting angry again because omfg. i did what they wanted and they still werent happy.

needless to say. our relationship in august and september was awful. i felt so angry, and they pretended like i had no reason to behave that way. i felt like they did not care one single bit about my wishes. once my dad caught me crying in my bed late at night and he said &quot;are you sad because your friends are leaving?&quot; and i was just like ???? what do they not get?? to them, i was just doing my &quot;duty&quot;. to them i had to go on my knees and thank them that i had even that. i never received an apology. i never received a thank you.

i didnt act well either. i would yell, i would scream, i would say horrible things. didnt they understand that all that was because i didnt want to go to that university? that i felt ignored and lied to?

in october i left for my new university. god it was so much better to not have to be around my parents. we only talked on the phone for like a minute every day. but we were civil. our relationship improved. but i did not like the classes. i just dont find them interesting. i managed to pass 5/6 classes with ok grades.

second term everything went wrong. i dont know why. but from the first week i understood that the first term, which was so difficult, had been way easier. classes were so much more complicated, and i had no will to study. just zero motivation. that cotinued till the end of the semester. i managed to pass 3/6 classes, one of them because everyone did badly and i thing the teacher graded on a curve and the other two i gave very very minimal effort. additionally, the friend group broke apart and i started really not enjoying my life there. just feels like everyone hates me, which i know is like, just another people pleasery thing i have but it did impact my life there. i do have one good friend who knows all this and i feel like i can trust her, and im grateful for her. but i dont enjoy my life there.

in my country youre given the choice to change university for the first two years after those difficult exams. i discussed with another friend who also knew how difficult my situation was and a friend of that friend who had abandoned her original school in her third year (computer science) to become a teacher. we decided that i would at least try to do that - go to the other city for chem school.

i told my parents. we had fight after fight once again. they told me &quot;i dont understand how you and your classmates dont realize what a good school youre in&quot; because electrical engineering probably has the best job prospects other than like, military. yes, i agree. but that means nothing if i hate what i do, if i always feel resentment for my job, if i never finish the university in the first place. and they told me that if i decided to go there i wouldn&#x27;t have enough money to go out, i would have a really small apartment, my mom might need to get a second job.

once again, the same things as last year: yelling, threats, youll end up as a teacher, youre just giving up cause its hard, etc

i think if i keep studying electrical engineering i wont make it. and even if i do ill hate myself so much for it, because i didnt stand up for myself to my parents and my sister (who had told me &quot;if you had the balls you would have gone to chem school&quot; but of course after she didnt have to change her life for me)

the truth is, the university is difficult yes, but i think its more the problem that i have zero motivation to study. to me, electrical engineering represents how my parents ignored me. if i choose to stay ill be choosing them over me, again. they never apologized for what they did. they never said thank you. they never will. if they had been honest with me i think i would have a better opportunity. but i feel so much resentment that i just cant do it. and if somehow i do, they would take it as me just being difficult just to be difficult, like oh, didnt we tell you you could do it? werent we right to completely ignore your wishes? it was for your own good. and my sister would once again mock me for not having the guts to do it. if i stay i feel like ill forever torment myself for being weak.

so. i dont know what to do. my parents have clarified that if i go to that other city for chem, id still have rent and bills. but it would be hard. i do understand that ill have a very limited social life. i wouldnt be able to go out much. no trips. a very tiny apartment. im willing to sacrifice that. ive gotten a job during the summer to help.  im mostly hesitating because while, yes, i want to go, i want to do it with my parents approval. but ill never have their approval. so i dont know. i do want our relationship to improve and i think this way it will.

on the other hand, yesterday i was talking to a friend about all of this, and i told her that if i stay i feel like ill never chase what i actually want, and for second i thought of something: if i go, ill be doing to them the same thing they did to me. id be ignoring their wishes for my sake. and theyve disappointed me so much that the last thing i want in my life is to be like them. and for a moment, i was sure id stay. and then i thought about how difficult the classes are. i thought about how they never extended that same grace to me. and i got angry again, and i realized i would just be the miserable one again while they got exactly what they wanted. there is no way for our relationship to improve if im there because theyll never apologize and ill never forgive and forget, nor accept.

by the way. they know all this. i told them about the resentment i feel, about how i feel ignored, about me being angry that they neither apologized nor thanked me for the sacrifice i made. to me it was a sacrifice. they didnt respond to any of that.

so, tldr: stay in a small town in a school i dont like feeling resentment for my parents, but have a better economical situation for my entire family, or go to a bigger city, to a still difficult school but one i chose, with a worse economical situation?

            <div class="content collapsed">Hi, I want to start by saying this post is very hard for me to write. My dad and I have always had a very turbulent relationship, mostly due to his drinking, but it had started to improve a couple years ago, around the time they were selling their house. I want to help him but I moreso don&#x27;t want anyone else to be hurt by his idiotic actions.

Background:

My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, I spent a portion of my childhood staying nights in hotels with my brothers and mom to get away from him because of his behavior. I can&#x27;t remember a time when my mom wasn&#x27;t threatening him with divorce over it and there were several times when it came close but never happened. I guess he just thought it would never happen and never improved. Until 2021 when my mom got a place of her own (after we all moved out) and started the proceedings. This caused him to get even worse and start spiralling. My brothers used to be kinda neutral towards him and take his side occasionally on things but as of a few years ago, neither really want anything to do with him. I stepped up to try and help him because if I didn&#x27;t he would likely already be dead. I would try to hang out with him at least once a week, whether I went to his place or he came over to mine. He started to get a little bit better but the divorce stuff was really ragging on him and would always reset his progress. I should mention the entire time my mom was trying to be cordial, but my dad isn&#x27;t exactly all that smart or good natured, and would try to manipulate her to getting back with him and throwing a fit when it didn&#x27;t work.


The accident:

Then one day, I get a call from my mom, no one has been able to get a hold of him for a couple days. I had been with the inlaws during this time and had not been able to check up on him. I started trying to find arrest records because I had figured he had done something stupid but nothing came up. She calls me a few hours later and said she found him at the hospital. He had been in a car accident and his BAC was several times the legal limit. He was in and out of consciousness and combative with the paramedics whenever he was awake, he had to be sedated to get him there. He was at the hospital over a month, unconscious for 3 weeks, because every time they would try to wake him up he either wouldn&#x27;t or he would start getting severe delirium tremens from withdrawals.


Somehow despite all this, he got a slap on the wrist, had to take a driving course and that was it.

While he was in the hospital I visited him as often as possible, but I had hoped they would either take his license or force him into court ordered rehab. Yes it was technically his first offense, but if you can&#x27;t even stay conscious until 3 weeks after the fact due to withdrawals, I&#x27;d figure that would be a tell tale sign that this wasn&#x27;t his first time, just the first time he&#x27;d been caught.


Aftermath:

After he got out I tried harder to help him. I hoped the whole thing would be a wake up call to get better. He went to rehab and left after a day because he said he didn&#x27;t like it. He started doing an online counseling thing to help him and said he was going to join a church group to surround himself with positive influences. I convinced him to get a gym membership and even though I live over an hour away, would go to the gym with him twice a week and we would grab dinner after, and sometimes I&#x27;d hang out at his place after that if it wasn&#x27;t too late. This went on for 6 or 7 months until he decided to cancel the membership because &quot;I could build a home gym for cheaper&quot; (it wasn&#x27;t an expensive gym, like $30 a month). He built a sort of gym with used equipment he got on Facebook marketplace but he only had a bench press set with weights that totalled up to 40 lbs, some 10 lb free weights and a mini stepper. I tried a couple times to make it work but it wasn&#x27;t a good setup and I don&#x27;t want to lose progress I had been working so hard to make. So I got a gym membership in my town and offered that he can drive to me on the same days and we can still work out. He never did. I would still visit him about once a week and talk on the phone with him often to try to keep him on track.

During that time, it actually felt like he was doing better. Growing up with him I could always tell when he was <mark>drunk</mark> or drinking and for a solid 6 months I didn&#x27;t get those vibes. I could actually have a conversation with him and him understand things that were more than surface level. There were a couple times when he would make a connection in something we were talking about or something that happened to an abstract concept and I was proud that his brain could do that because I only ever remembered him as being confused or understanding very basic things. But it slowly started going away. He would start asking questions again that he had just asked a few minutes beforehand, 6,7, 8 times in the same conversation. His speech patterns fell back into sounding <mark>drunk</mark>, his behaviours started to feel primitive again. My wife and I would search his RV and car but we wouldn&#x27;t find anything, and I hoped that maybe I was wrong but on the inside I knew. A couple months later my brother found a bottle of alcohol under his car seat. Granted it wasn&#x27;t opened, but it was there, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t from before the accident because that car had been totalled, this car was acquired after. I felt really betrayed, he knew what alcohol had done to our lives so far and was in a place to improve. He had so much support behind him between all of his family, counselors, friends, etc. Even though I was livid I still talked with him and visited, albeit not as much as before.


Today&#x27;s events:

I got a call from my mom a few hours ago. My dad isn&#x27;t home and she had went to get some of her stuff from his office. One of my dad&#x27;s coworkers is there and stops to speak with her. He tells her that he is very worried about my dad, as he is drinking again in full force, and he has had to stop him from getting in the car and driving while he was <mark>drunk</mark>. Once again, I am livid. This is his second chance and he is <mark>blow</mark>ing it. It is only a matter of time before he kills himself or someone else in a car accident. I don&#x27;t want this to happen, it&#x27;s one thing if he hurts himself but if he hurts someone else I don&#x27;t know what I would do. I have considered contacting the judge and asking him if there&#x27;s anything he could do to force him into rehab, but the first accident was over a year ago and I don&#x27;t know if anything would come if it.

What should I do? I don&#x27;t care at this point how he is reprimanded, just that he is before someone dies at his hands. I don&#x27;t know if I can come to the police with &quot;hey, my dad drives <mark>drunk</mark> a lot, I just don&#x27;t know exactly when&quot;. We are in Florida, if anyone knows any statutes/laws/whatever that could apply here to help. Thank you to anyone that read this and has any advice to offer.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I (30M) have had a lot of mental health issues recently due to my work, past relationships and huge lifestyle changes. 

I got out of a horrible relationship where I was being financially manipulated, basically <mark>forced</mark> to pay for takeaways all the time because my gf (27F) didn&#x27;t want to eat my food and wouldn&#x27;t cook herself, refused to do anything to keep the house clean while I was working and she wasn&#x27;t, attacked me and left me with a bite mark on my arm which is scarred and would fight my family as well until we finally broke up.

I am now in a relationship with my current gf (30F) who is an old school friend of mine so I know how very well and she&#x27;s an angel. Cooks and cleans despite being pregnant with my son while I work full time and tells me she loves me when I go through a bout of depression or anxiety attack. She is a much stronger person than me.

Work sucks and I don&#x27;t feel valued or listened to at all. That&#x27;s all you need to know there.

I try to chill and game with my clan on an evening but I sometimes rage because of the game I play (Destiny 2 if anyone is wondering) and it&#x27;s getting worse and worse each day. Gaming friends of mine (basically the only friends I have despite my gf) tell me I&#x27;m &quot;too much&quot; so I haven&#x27;t spoken to them in a while to give them a break from me as I feel like I&#x27;m being toxic.

I also quit social media because I found myself arguing with random people online and decided it wasn&#x27;t healthy behaviour for a dad-to-be and I don&#x27;t want to be a bad influence.

The point is, I don&#x27;t want to become this nasty, cantankerous and hateful person. I am pushing everyone away and I don&#x27;t want to start pushing away my loved ones. My gf, my son and my dog are everything to me but I also have parents and a sister I love to death. I want to know what can I do to stop becoming this awful person before absolutely everyone hates me if they don&#x27;t already.

I&#x27;m not trying to <mark>blow</mark> my own trumpet on the internet, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a horrible person deep down. My closest people don&#x27;t think I am anyway. How do I stop this? 

TL;Dr: I think I&#x27;m being toxic to people a lot and want to stop this behaviour but it gets too far.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">May be long but I&#x27;ll try to condense as much as possible.

I&#x27;ve been in my current employment just over 7.5 years, coordinating a social program for adults with disabilities. Over that time we (Australia) have had major funding reform for disability services and it&#x27;s resulted in a boom in demand and an enormous increase in workload. The org has grown very big, very fast and I often find that different departments (HR, Client Management etc) have differing opinions about what&#x27;s necessary with regard to procedures and required documentation, resulting in us Coordinators trying to manage multiple conflicting priorities. Add to that my manager can not grasp how much my role has changed and how big the workload has become, she&#x27;s old school and of the opinion you don&#x27;t get personal in the workplace - you pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get it done, and no matter how hard I try to explain she can&#x27;t wrap her head around why it&#x27;s different to when she was running the service 20 years ago.

I used to be full-time in the office, and still struggled to maintain the workload. I&#x27;ve been asking for help for over a year and a half - I&#x27;m not picky about how the help comes, whether it&#x27;s better definition of the actual responsibilities of the role, another person to help or extra training if there&#x27;s something I can improve, I&#x27;m up for it. Since July 2020 they&#x27;ve restructured my role to be half office, half direct support - and yet I&#x27;m still expected to get the same amount of admin work completed. Additionally, the direct support work is all after 5pm on weekdays, and all weekend - even though I do the roster I can&#x27;t make up the rest of the hours in any regular capacity, I have to take on extra weekend shifts and client holidays, requiring me to be away from my family the majority of the time. I&#x27;ve explained this style of working is hard for me with a young family, but since my employer coerced me into signing the new agreement (You can sign or you can leave type of deal) they insist that&#x27;s how it will be from now on.

This has been wearing me down for YEARS. I&#x27;m depressed, anxious, feel hopeless, and like I&#x27;m not heard or valued. I&#x27;m less able to manage my emotions and find myself <mark>blow</mark>ing up over tiny things, and that&#x27;s not like me.

Cue my annual performance appraisal a week ago. Beforehand, my manager asked for a list of things that aren&#x27;t working for me so she could &#x27;understand and wrap her head around why I say the role&#x27;s not working for me. I compiled it (workload too high, irregular shift work burning me out, lack of work/life balance hardly seeing my family and too tired to do a thing with then when I do, poorly defined role, not wanting to work EVERY weekend etc) and emailed it to her a week prior. We get to the appraisal and she basically tells me she&#x27;s sick of me, sick of having this conversation, my points are invalid, it&#x27;s too bad that&#x27;s now the role and you can either work it or leave. Additionally she presented a new requirement that because my contract says my work can be rostered over the entire spectrum of hours in the week I will now be required to have my work phone on me 24/7, without remuneration, and keep a log of calls/texts that need dealing with and negotiate TOIL with her for any time spent outside of rostered hours. She noted &#x27;poor time management&#x27; as the reason for my inability to complete allotted work, and under areas where I need to develop skills she listed &#x27;emotional intelligence&#x27; - and related this back to times where I&#x27;ve (unprofessionally and mostly recently) lost my cool and snapped at her, or a colleague, or not been generally upbeat. 

By the end of last week, my Doctor had put me on stress leave due to imminent breakdown after I ended up in his office in such a mess I could barely speak. While I&#x27;m home I&#x27;ve been researching emotional intelligence and how to improve it, I can definitely see the benefit and am trying to remain objective with my research but it seems all of the advice on EQ in the workplace, I&#x27;ve already tried over and over - calmly stating my concerns, offering any solutions I can think of (which are always rejected without alternatives) etc. I always thought I had reasonable emotional intelligence skills, and have spent SO long pretending to be happy and capable but feel like I get shot down (example: The morning after my appraisal a colleague from another office visited, I felt like crap but I put on a smile and asked her how she was, then telling her I was doing great in response to her reply - my boss smirked &#x27;Yeah, until I tell her to do something&#x27;). 

So finally to my question - is it a reasonable expectation to place on myself, that the sole issue is my lack of Emotional Intelligence and if I work on this the situation will resolve, or is it a two-way street where no matter how well developed my emotional intelligence may or may not be my employer should accept some responsibility for what I feel is a toxic and unrealistic work environment? Do emotionally intelligent people still get burned out and have difficulty regulating their emotions after years of toxicity and unmet requests for assistance, or are they just able to take it in stride? I guess what I&#x27;m asking is am I the TOTAL problem here? Or are there influences that can reasonably explain my current state?

For the record, I&#x27;m the sole breadwinner and there&#x27;s not a lot of work around at the moment, so I can&#x27;t just leave without finding something else similar first.

            <div class="content collapsed">So I am in a bit of a pickle, first time poster long time reader. Some background info:

My mother has coddled me for a long time and since my parents separated back in 2018 and I moved in with my mother and my grandparents it has gotten even worse. My dad does his best to make me independent, but he back fires a lot on what he has done by saying things like, &quot;You won&#x27;t survive out there,&quot; &quot;You are gonna be broke and in debt,&quot; &quot;you&#x27;ll never be able to achieve your dreams at your current state.&quot; Stuff like that, he&#x27;s not 100% wrong, but he has very little faith in what I do know. 

I live in a kinda suburban area, it can get really country here, but the area I live is not so much like that, but go about a city or two over and it&#x27;s pure country. Let&#x27;s say the states capital really overwhelmed me the first time I went with all the big buildings, and when I went to New York it was ten times worse. The only big buildings you would see are like main buildings, like libraries or hospitals; buildings for other purposes are only just now being built.

That also goes along with my education, I have a southerners education, and not the good kind. I have pretty good grades, but the pace we learned at was very slow. Example:  We learned the proper format to write an essay in tenth grade, in Connecticut you learn that in middle school. Where I live the teachers don&#x27;t care about you, counselors are horrible and wont get you anywhere, basically any help that has to do with college that isn&#x27;t local is out of the question, even when it&#x27;s local it&#x27;s still like that. My dad only has his GED and my mom didn&#x27;t get her associates and just went to cosmetology school to become a nail technician, they are not well-versed in college at all.

I was 15, almost 16, when my parents separated. I have wanted to get a job since I was 14, but I either worked with my dad in his trade, which he only paid me via food, or searched for jobs that I would never get any feedback from. My mother though, like I said she coddled me, has never wanted me to get a job, a life for myself. Her exact words for me were, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you do anything, I want you to stay dependent on me and your dad.&quot; This usually wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for some people, they would be like, &quot;heck yeah free college education and never having to work until after that, sweet!&quot; With me though, I want and crave to be independent, but I never learned how, I don&#x27;t know how. 

Every single time I have wanted to make a choice for myself that didn&#x27;t align with my mom&#x27;s path for me, she would scream and yell at me for it; I have severe anxiety and yelling and screaming is a big trigger for me, and she knows it. My mother doesn&#x27;t even make enough money to pay rent, that&#x27;s why we live with my grandparents, and has only worked for about four or five years now; after not working for over 8 years. My dad only makes enough to cover bills on his end and for all the insurance, with some extra money when needed, and he lives rent-free. I know for a fact I will have to take a loan out for college.

I can&#x27;t even complete my FAFSA because she isn&#x27;t complying, I have been waiting over a month trying to get her to give me her information to fill out the parent portion, I know I could just leave it out, but I don&#x27;t want to risk not being able to get financial aid, my dad is a lost cause, I can only get it from her. I have been trying to do research and apply for scholarships, but I haven&#x27;t found a lot that I could apply for, and I have never been educated on them: My educational background can be summed up to a finish high school and get out, no help from college besides a once a year college booth set up with nearby colleges and the military in the high school gym. My friend up north has had scholarship opportunities given to her by the school on a plate, she barely has to look up for scholarships, if at all, because her school provides a ton of them to her. I cried when I found this out and I realized how terrible my school system is. 

I&#x27;m getting a bit off track, I just have so much bottled up inside and I&#x27;m terrible at explaining. 

Currently, since I was hit off kilter with the, &quot;hey you&#x27;re graduating!&quot; I missed a huge opportunity to apply for scholarships, my school is a bit weird but i wont get into that, but I tried to apply to as many as I could, I don&#x27;t even know what scholarships are legit or not; I don&#x27;t know what I can trust, what is real and what is applicable for me. I am taking my ACT on the 18 and I&#x27;ve put a lot of money into studying for it, then I&#x27;m going to apply to my dream college, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and I plan on getting my bachelors in Korean and applying to Korean for Professionals; and fashion design and merchandising or a different major with an influence in Korean if I can. If I don&#x27;t get in I&#x27;m taking a gap year to get a job, apply for more scholarships, and re-taking the ACT until I get a bomb score.

But where is the problem? It all starts at the roots: Mom. You remember how I said she would yell and scream at me when things didn&#x27;t go her way with me? Yeah, she is still doing it, there is absolutely no reasoning with her. She will just keep getting angry and pissy with me, yelling if she has to and riding up my butt with what I WILL be doing for college. She is basically trying to force me into going to the community college, then transferring to the local university. She has yelled and screamed at me ever since I decided I was going out of state, that, &quot;You are not going anywhere! You are staying here and you WILL go to the University of State and that is final!&quot; 

She knows I want to major in Korean, and she has accepted that, and tried to compromise with me and I have tried my literal best to compromise with her, I told her that I am firm in going to UH Manoa, but I will go to a community college of MY choice. That is where I found LACC, they offer an associates in Korean, I thought this was perfect; especially because this was a college my mom recommended to me and said she wouldn&#x27;t mind me going to. Then just a couple days later after I tell her that I&#x27;m going to do it and that I was working on becoming a student, she absolutely <mark>blow</mark>s up at me. She acts as if I am going against everything, that this was even worse, and then start up with the I need to stay local, because she can only afford to send me locally.

Now I understand the financial difficulty, but I am planning on relying completely on student loans, and you may think this is a little crappy of me, but she can&#x27;t even afford to pay for the local community college here, only my dad can. She has no right to dictate where I should go and say it&#x27;s because she can&#x27;t afford it when she can&#x27;t even afford where she wants me to go in the first place.

Now this is where I get to the thick of it, where I really need advice. How do I go about this? What loans could I get will actually help me and how do I go about it? How do I find good student accommodations in Hawaii on Oahu? What scholarships or websites or whatever should I look into? I just need advice on how to do this: I have never lived out of state, I have never been truly on my own, and I don&#x27;t know what I need to do to make this happen. I know the simplicity of it, but the actual details and in depth reading on what each thing is and what it does and how it&#x27;ll help me? I&#x27;m at a loss.

I have tried to do this all on my own, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to successfully do it, so I was hoping some humans with more experience than me can help.

I apologize for the length and any non-necessary information

            <div class="content collapsed">I have a 15 year old daughter. When she was 4 years old her mom was having an affair. We divorced rather quickly. And had a mediation. Shared custody was agreed upon with primary custody given to me.
A couple months later her and her new boyfriend decided they were going to move to his hometown out of state. 
Not only did she move out of state but over the course of the next couple months slowly faded away. She never showed for her visitation. And her phone calls started becoming rare. With her making promises to call, but not doing  so 
The year was 2009.
This of course crushed this little girl.
 she cried herself to sleep every night for what seemed like a year. She of course blamed herself. No matter how much I tried to reassure her that wasnt the case I&#x27;m not sure if she ever believed that.
I was left alone with a broken hearted 4 year old girl.
And somehow I was supposed to put her back together.
So I did the best that I could. And we did OK. I tried to give her the most normal life a single dad could give a little girl. I tried hard to keep her from becoming a life long victim, but no matter what I did. She always felt different. 
School was an unexpected problem. I assumed that she would go and find other kids missing a parent and it would make her feel more normal, knowing she wasnt alone.
I was proven wrong. Yes there were kids there who had a dad missing. But no one was missing a mother. I learned to hate mother daughter events, I particularly hated mothers day. Where the kids made gifts for their moms. The teachers were clueless on how to approach her.. Unintentionally but Noticeably treating her as though she were somehow sick. As if there was something wrong. with her. 
This was the life we lived, over the years we went through alot. All the time I constantly. Tried to give her twice the love consciously telling her how much.i loved her. Always trying to reassure her that I would never give up on her, and letting her know that no matter what she did, or what choices she made I would love her because my love came with no conditions. 
We struggled but survived. But nothing could ever fill the hole that her mom left behind. She was always holding onto that little bit of sad. She just wanted her damned mom
I made absolutely sure that we could easily be found. For 2 years we lived in the same apartment that we were in when she left. After a couple years I was worn thin needed help raising this girl, so we moved in with my mom. About 7 blocks away.
My parents had lived here for the last 25 years in all that time the phone number never changed.and if you were looking for me this would be a very logical place to start your search.
We lived in the same school district from preschool to Jr high.
All this time my daughter was in constant contact with her maternal grandma, as well as her aunts.
Everyone in her moms family was completely aware of where she was. They all had my phone and address and at one point I even put my kid on a plane and let her go stay with them. 
This was my failsafe. If this woman wanted to find us all she had to do was call her mom
We stayed put for 7 years. The phone was always on the phone number never changed.
2016 first contact my daughter found her mom on instagram. I wasnt there to witness the conversation. But it ended with this woman we had not seen in 7 years calling my daughter a little bitch. Im understanding that my kid was less than polite.
After she quit calling the girl names. She started with the poor upbringing. Convinced that I had spent the last decade filling her with hste.
Like she won&#x27;t have enough reasons of her own to have mommy issues
 she screamed brainwashed insulted me,. And cursed at her. Being as mean as she possibly could.
Only to She notified my kid that she not only had sisters. But she will never meet them because she didnt want the filth of her abandoned kid to contaminate the wotthy.ones.
I SHIT YOU NOT... THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
Not verbatim but damn.  
Another tear I had to wipe away. I took out my heart glue. Picked the piece up and glued it back in place. 
This was the first time I ever hoped.to never hear from her again.
Circumstances changed I ended up losing my job, and at 50 years old it was devastating. We moved in with a friend and I searched for work ultimately I applied for a state grant to go learn to drive a truck. It wasnt optimal because of the one parent problem but we needed me making money. If I had to hire a care provider to help. 2019. My.kid  informs me that she has been talking to her mom on the phone. She is 15 now, and my only response was please be careful she is carrying an unearned title and is essentially a stranger. I didnt monitor her conversations. But it was obvious they were getting along I still had alot of anger around this so i.et them go completly blinded by how happy.my daughter was. Over the next couple months they formed a relationship. COVID closed the schools and <mark>forced</mark> me to stay out in my truck. I had her go stay with her cousin who just had a new baby, and she was fine, safe, .I knew she was talking to her mom. And I knew was prepared for the question. Can I go down to see my mom? I still didnt trust her, because it seemed like every chance she got to take a shot at me she did. I told my daughter the concern she promised she wouldnt tolerate her bashing me.
I called the grandma and really after 10 years of this she had gained my trust. I used her reference when she told me her daughter has changed.
So ok have fun. The plan was a couple weeks to see how it goes. She would be coming back when I went on home time in a couple weeks.
Initially it was a success and was better than I could have possibly hoped for. My kid called me multiple times a day. Sharing with me pictures of her brother and sister. She was the big sister. I was told about the housekeepers and the pet store they owned, and apparently they ran a dispensary with limited clients.
For the first time in as long as I remember I was able to breathe a sigh of relief. A huge weight had been lifted. I wont lie. I was.a bit jealous so in damn... housekeepers? Cool obviously she did well for herself. 
The first sign of trouble. 
Dad you wouldnt believe the amount of money they have spent on me.
I shrugged it off and was just happy that this kid got her mom back.
I was still getting I love you dad calls.
Now this was 2 weeks ago. The train wreck happened so fast I still got no idea where it came from or even how it happened.
The calls abruptly stopped. I allowed 4 days to pass before I called. She seemed distant but nothing that would set off an alarm I told her not to let so.much time pass before her next call.
3 days pass same thing we discussed her home assignment. That schools suggest.kids do.
Once again saying dont wait too long to call.me.
Home time. She was supposed.to come back now.
But she is doing so well and so happy she just gets preoccupied and g
Forgets to call
  I had no intention of asking her to come back.
She would miss me soon and want to see me.
I had not really talked to her in over a week. I tried asking her to call. She wouldnt. I called her.she was distant. 
Last time I called she picks up the phone I could actually hear the attitude. There were kids screaming in the background I asked if she could go somewhere less chaotic so we could talk. She responded we have kids they are always screaming. Well can you call.me back after they go to bed?
She asked why.
Well I want to talk to you.
So she yelled. THEN FUCKING TALK.!!!
This pissed me off so bad I just hung up.
Figured shes in a mood I&#x27;ll try later.
Text message came in. Keep in mind I dont talk to her mom. Because she absolutely can not.talk to me without insulting me or the way I raised this girl because. It didnt bother me I assumed that my daughter would shut her down if she talked too much shit. Plus she abandoned this kid for a decade she had absolutely no right to question my parenting.
To keep peace I ignored her little jabs.
But this text I could not ignore.
It read as follows.verbatim.
If you keep calling her and being a child and hanging up on her, I&#x27;ll get her a new phone and you&#x27;ll learn what I felt the last tween years. Grow up and stop acting like a child and guilt tripping her with the &#x27;I miss yous&#x27; and what not. You at least get to still talk to her unlike how I was able to. 
I never knew I miss you was a guilt trip.
The threat to buy her a new phone and not supply me with the number. Was real. But the thing that made me just lose it.
She just made a comment.... sounded like childish revenge. 
Revenge for what? She should be thanking me and apologizing for her absence.
I laid out ten years of bottled up.anger in one paragraph. 
That was being typed by shaking hands and the words seemed to come straight from my chest.
The highlights were pretty much you should be ashamed of yourself from walking out on this little girl.. You left her, and dont even have enough remorse to apologize, you claim to be a victim
I couldnt believe what I was hearing.
She then proceeded to accuse me of hiding from her. Keeping on the move, changing my phone number frequently so she could never catch up with us.
The number one glaring argument against this.
Is why? Why would I go through that kind of trouble?
What would possibly be my motive for doing such a thing. Aside from a future therapy bill for the kid.
What followed was something I did not expect. 
My daughter was suddenly scolding me for starting a fight. She payed no attention that her mom just threatened to change her number so I couldnt contact her, no nevermind that she just insulted me .
That she drew first blood in this.
And stood by while her mom accused me of going to extreme lengths to prevent her from being able to make contact.
I took my lumps for losing my cool.
And my next question was just direct.
Your not buying this load of crap are you?
Do you honestly think I did this?
She said I dont know who&#x27;s lying.
How the hell did she... what the  $^&amp;*?
She just made the claim legitimate
Still not concerned, for 2 very good reasons. We have family on both sides that were around the whole damned time.
So I made one last attempt to reach her. And realized it was pointless so I said I&#x27;m not going to stand here and get insulted you know damn well this is a lie.so when you decide you want to talk to me without the insults. Until then bigger off.
She replied.
gladly. maybe some day when you get cancer like your father did you’ll see what tf is wrong with you.
Then she blocked me.
What the hell just happened here.?
I called her mom. And.let her know what just happened. I expected her to be angry that this was happening. She was in fact very apathetic. Claiming she didnt want to get involved.
I told her she got involved when she influenced my decision to send my child 300 miles away.
Neither of these people were around when autumn would wish she had a mom she could give a mothers day gift to.
So if what they are saying is true. I knowingly and intentionally kept the whereabouts of my daughter a classified secret. 
It means that I seen the tears  I watched this girl wish she had a mom.for the last decade. 
I could have helped her but chose to continue hiding her from her.mom for my own selfish reasons.
My daughter thinks this. She is telling me this stranger, that holds the unearned title of mom has convinced her so thoroughly she refuses to look at simple reason. She claims to have proof but thats impossible. I was shown one thing. The print out of am email sent to my place of employment dated 2010. It said this is my current phone number.
Please have our daughter give me a call and accused me of hiding. 
A very impressive piece that shows her pain and desperation. And she presented it saying I kept everything.
OK at first glance and the way it was presented it even made me question reality.
I had not worked for that company since august 2009 so she sent it to a dead e mail.
And she made the statement I kept everything.
And this was her go to piece?
The one that was supposed to <mark>blow</mark> my mind?
The other glaring discrepancy is she left for Missouri months before I quit that job. So if she kept everything. She was gone for over a year b4 she sent this. When this was sent we still lived in the exact same spot that we did when she left.
I try and dispute it. I&#x27;m told by my daughter to just shut up. She has never had her mom before and is accusing me of attempting to ruin it.
These are not the words of the kid I sent down.
The words of the kid that 2 weeks ago said she was so happy that she had both of us in her life.
She told me to leave her alone. 
I&#x27;m trying to make sense of this. I need to know how next to proceed. 
I would respect her wishes. If I knew they were truly her wishes. 
It&#x27;s so out of character for her I have to ask what the hell kind of mind games have they been playing.
She called me a snake. 
The lie that they are clinging to is so preposterous I havent ruled out drugs, or a damned science fiction mind control device.
Whatever the hell this lady did to my kid in one month  what has she been shown?
Why hasnt her own logic and reason kicked in?
For her to believe this would require her to completly abandon all reason and lie to herself.
Not to mention the horrible comment her mom made to me.
Now you can suffer as I have suffered.
What the fuck? Are you using my little girl to get revenge on me?
Revenge for what? Why are you not saying I&#x27;m sorry.
Thank you for all you have done it must have been tough?  Now everything there is a question mark behind these are my questions.
How did they not only get her to believe this lie, but sway her whole opinion of me?
I have a proven track record and should have earned enough trust with my daughter why has she not given me the benefit of the doubt, and allowed me to view and refute any thing they have shown her?
Why was the change so sudden?
Everything in my body and mind is telling me my daughter is in trouble and needs my help.
My daughter claims she is fine, they have treated her with nothing but kindness.
I disagree. They have lied and sold her on a lie.
Even though they did it with gifts and a smile.
The entire damned relationship is built on a lie apparently designed to get revenge.
It is a lie that can not be maintained and the illusion dies with the slightest bit of scrutiny.
When that happens I fear for that girls entire self image. And the guilt she would most assuredly carry having treated me this way.
Do I attempt to keep trying to reach her?
She refuses to listen to me.
Does anyone else think shes in trouble and needs my help? Am I supposed to just accept that this has happened, and respect her wishes?
Are these truly her wishes?
Why I&#x27;s she not furious at this lady?
This whole thing stinks of shady manipulation 
Is.my daughter so desperately clinging to an  I want to believe my mom loves me so bad, sttitude and just rejecting reality?
There is no possible way thst after all the hurt she has caused this girl only to come in and tell her that I was the bad guy. No possible way forcing me out of her life with lies displays anything but self serving revenge.
Am I looking at this the wrong way?
 Isnt it obvious that she is being bullied and manipulated.
To manipulate her and I&#x27;m betting she is pushing the envelope to damn near criminal illegal?
Is this child abuse?
Is there anything I can do to intercede legally?
Should I?
I need advice on what I should do. 2 weeks ago she told me she was happy she had both parents in her life.
I just want her to be happy, even if I need to step away. But I dont think she is happy. I know my daughter loves me. I know that the bond that we formed over the last decade is real.
It has to be real doesnt 
There is no damned way she is happy hating me is there?
I am absolutely lost and I dont know what I should do. Advice and insight is what I&#x27;m seeking here.

            <div class="content collapsed">hey. throwaway in case anyone I know finds this, but here’s the deal: I threw away all of my friends away to protect one person.

basically, the one person made a huge mistake that harmed another close friend. the other close friend told their story (it was hard to keep), and it led to the one person trying to commit suicide. 

I was completely ready to abandon them as everyone else was, but I was sort of <mark>forced</mark> into helping them not die (which I mean, no complaints about, life is always precious).

anyways, they ended up in the psych ward at the hospital afterwards, and they tell me about it afterwards. it was completely horrible, with the one person being treated insanely poorly and not even receiving any real immediate treatment. they ended up discharging the one person, and they’re taking some time to reflect.

the one person decides to ask me and the friend who they hurt to come and talk to them. they don’t ask for forgiveness, they just talk it out with the victim, all while i’m there comforting the victim.

anyways, when talking privately, the one person and I decided to still remain friends, just sort of in secret so it didn’t drastically affect my social life. 

it worked, but people weren’t all as harsh to the one person as I thought. them, I and a couple of other people ended up becoming close, but one of them sort of took a misunderstanding out of context and spread it.

now, my friend group has three sort of major influences currently- the victim, the person who misunderstood things, and a super close friend of mine. they ended up getting together and talking behind my back about all of the bad that the one person and I had done, and how bad it was that I was still close with them.

this sentiment echoed in our friend group, and I was sort of cast out of it. a lot of people just didn’t talk to me anymore, while others stayed neutral with me. but needless to say, i think there’s about one person from that whole group I feel completely comfortable with, and we aren’t even that close.

the original victim was strongly against me, and one day voiced all of the concerns that the friend group had about me. some of these absolutely enraged me, even attacking my personal life, but I kept my cool and tried to improve. however, almost everyone in my friend group has done something messed up or has way worse qualities than me, so it was clear they were outcasting me mostly due to me hanging out with that one person in order to support them. :))

anyways, the victim didn’t think i improved, so she cut me off. she thought our friendship was toxic and that both of us had been doing bad things, even admitting to talking behind my back. again, I’m not a saint, but I wasn’t doing more than half of the things she said I was. so, after she cut me off, the remainder of the group started distancing themselves from me.

due to all of this, i’ve been <mark>forced</mark> to lean on that one person the way they initially leaned on me, which was quite heavily. I handled it, and I lost my friends because of it, but I was defending what I cared about. this isn’t to say that the others didn’t matter, and I tried to be there for them, but the fact I was around someone they didn’t approve of, the victim’s disapproval of me and the constant <mark>blow</mark>ing things out of proportion all ruined my social life.

now, I just lean on that one person. I occasionally talk to a few others, but I don’t go out anymore. I have no life anymore. My life is just working, the other person, my family, and trying to fill the void up by binge watching YouTube videos. 

I’m beyond tired. I feel like I don’t have anyone (aside from those aforementioned) to lean on. making new friends where I am is really not an option, because everyone’s already in their little cliques, and I’ll be out of there come June.

if I could have one wish (aside from like world peace or the like), it would be to go back to a time before that incident, and just prevent it. I wish things were as easy as they used to be. 


TL;DR: I stood by one person because my friends were being shitty, and they cut me off for it. I don’t know how to overcome the loneliness that not having friends brings.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e35y5i/not_sure_if_im_depressed/" target="_blank" class="title">Not sure if I’m depressed</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Hi, probably an unoriginal post. Asked by thousands already, but I need advice I guess. Not sure how or with what though.

To start off, I’m an 18M. I live with my dad alone atm. My mom and sister moved about half a year ago, a bit longer than that now that I think about it, due to.... problems. The short version is: my mom has severe health problems, but is most likely also dealing with mental problems stemming from her youth (PTSD). Her mental state may or may not exasturbate her physical disabilities too. 
My sister is also disabled, not severely, but she does have some mental disabilities. She has a relatively low IQ, but is still quite good at making conversation. She is very influenced by others and thus left together with my mom. She hasn’t spoken to me or my father in months. Neither has my mother. Sometimes my mom tries to contact me, but frankly, I cannot really talk to her. There is so much I can’t talk to her about. When I begin to talk about some problems or difficult subjects she shuts down entirely. It’s only small talk, and I can’t deal with that. I can’t just do small talk with my mother.

My dad is caring for my elderly mother. She lives in a nursing home now, and has been deteriorating quite a bit over the last few months. He drives around an hour to see her, and an hour back. 
Maybe it’s good to state that my dad also had/has cancer and is also physically impaired by it. Pain mostly. 
He is on the verge of collapse. Between the sudden dissapearance of his wife, who claims the most horrible things about him and says she doesn’t want any contact, caring for his mother, caring for me and himself and keeping our finances (taxes, insurance etc) up to date, he is struggling. He sleeps too little, and when he does he is haunted by nightmares. I’m quite sure he is depressed, but he says he won’t end his life, because he couldn’t do that to me and his mother, most importantly. He has very little energy to do anything but be at home, sleep intermitently, and read. 

I’m still in highschool, last year. Lately I have been noticing some weird things. I don’t think I feel the same as others. I can’t remember the last time I cried. Yesterday we hear my gran’s cousin died (bless her soul) and well.... I don’t feel much. My dad is very sad. I just take it all in. It’s not like I’m in the driver’s seat anymore. I see what is happening around me, but I don’t feel emotions really, I think. Or dulled maybe, I’m not sure. 

Tonight, I cut, or tried to at least, for the first time. It didn’t really work. I wanted to, but my hands didn’t work with me. I hurt myself, but I didn’t draw blood. I feel like a failure. I can’t even hurt myself right. Somewhere I know I’m just doing it in the hopes someone will notice cuts on my arm at school, and I’m <mark>forced</mark> to say what I’m typing now. It’s a desperate call for help. I don’t know where to seek it. I don’t want to burdon my girlfriend with this. Not my dad either, it would wreck him, it would be the final <mark>blow</mark>. 

Sometimes I think about death. What would happen if I ended my own life. It wouldn’t be hard. I’d go out blissfully stoned out of my mind mixing my dad’s opiöids with some alcohol and weed. A nice cocktail of respiratory depression. My rational mind always jumps to: if I go I have to take my grandma and dad with me. A murder suicide. I couldn’t do that to them. Couldn’t leave them behind with me dead. At night I fantasize how it would have to go down. And again, I don’t really feel sadness. Just nothing. Emptiness. 

I don’t know where to go from here. This story is a mess by itself, and won’t get read and reacted to probably, but it is easier to speak my mind on the internet, anonymously.

I don’t like to throw around the word depressed. Lot’s of youths like to claim they have anxiety and depression as a part of their edgy identity. I feel like I laugh too much to be depressed. I have fun with friends at school, that’s not depressed. 

My future in uncertain, and I’m not sure if I want to be there when it unfolds. If you made it this far, I congratulate you. I could write so much more, but this is a short summary of the things that are going on. Thank you for taking time out of your life to read this. 

Any and all thoughts are appreciated.

            <div class="content collapsed">sorry, this is a long one. 

last night my boyfriend (19m) and i (19f) of almost a year went to a mutual friend’s apartment to stay the night. the friend and i did acid but my boyfriend tends to avoid such substances so he stuck to liquor.
anyway, as the night goes on my boyfriend begins to get progressively more <mark>drunk</mark> and verbally aggressive. think douchey frat kid, he was just being a jackass. 

later that evening, while i was speaking candidly about a man i had dated perviously, my boyfriend got so worked up over it that he grabbed my face and told me that the ex deserved to die a terrible death for what he did to me. of course i was shocked and asked him why he would even say that, which he responded with “for forcing himself onto you!”, which neither of the two other people there even knew about. 

of course, this upset me so i started to tear up. i went to the bathroom to collect myself and my boyfriend followed me and begged for my forgiveness for the rest of the night. 

i just don’t know what to take away from this. of course he was under the influence so i shouldn’t <mark>blow</mark> this too out of proportion but the whole experience was just so traumatic, i had never seen him so belligerent in my life. 

thank you for reading.</div>

Now I barely passed college and am a failing balding 20-something wannabe sports announcer deadbeat addicted to weed.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I realized my mom seems to be slightly on the spectrum, which my dad must have realized at some point too, because he cheated on her when I was a kid, but then they lied about it until I caught him attempting (not subtly at all) to cheat again, so my mom admitted the first time had happened. But even after they they are still together (I think because my mom knows she would have nothing left without my dad, she has no social skills and very few friends) and my little brother still doesn’t know any of that.

So my neurotypical father and on the spectrum mother also happened to raise us to be outcasts, to march to the best of your own drum, and to explore all your curiosities, fascinations and obsessions to the fullest.

This was a great environment to grow up in as a kid, like a dreamland daycare center, and I was confident and nice and loving, I was a star student early in school and I tried a variety of instruments, represented my elementary school in competitions, played sports, got along with everyone, was a leader in school and selected to play prominent roles representing my class at our many patriotic plays that we would put on for parents in elementary school. This was because both of my outstanding character, and my lack of fear of being in the spotlight, almost craving the spotlight.

The culmination of this was when I was 9 years old. My nickname in baseball was “Mr Mayor” for my diplomatic, glue-like presence. So I was selected by my school and my classmates to play George W Bush in our school’s enactment of inauguration week. I had a “first lady” a beautiful girl in my class and “secret service agents” several other male classmates dressed like secret service; them and I got to skip classes all week to attend events such as a “parade” down the hallway lined with kindergarteners, an “inaugural luncheon” with first graders”, or an “inaugural ball” with second graders in the gym which had been transformed into a function hall, where my “first lady” and I were made to square dance for several local newspaper reporters and pose for ceremonial pictures. 

But the other part about my parents that I didn’t mention is that they saw this potential early on and tried to help me develop talents, figuring I could hopefully master on of them and use the rest of my intelligence to fulfil my potential and become a star in my field.

They did this using the methods prescribed by Tiger Woods’ dad. At first they literally tried to raise me to be tiger woods, as they are both golfers, and so they would bring me to the golf course and have me watch golf on tv, making tiger woods my idol. And I do love golf, I love golf courses, I love the history of golf and I want to broadcast golf. But at the same time despite expressing interest in becoming a professional golfer, I absolutely hated practicing, and had a horrible temperament on the course for a drawn out game like golf (my emotions tend to ride or die on every single shot, which means my momentum can be halted quickly). This makes me perfect for golf broadcasting, as I can inject much needed drama in a mostly lifeless tv event (except when tiger’s playing). 

And that’s where we move the story along because it was clearly not going to be golf, and it wasn’t looking like it was going to be piano either, as I began to struggle because I didn’t want to practice. So at age 9, the quest to make me a prodigy at traditional things seemed to have failed because of my lack of commitment, but at the same time I was having my personal peak with the “Presidential inauguration” week and completing the sweep of finishing first in my class every year of elementary school. So the idea that I could be generationally great at anything I wanted to was still there, I was showing tons of potential, it just wasn’t likely to be in a traditional child prodigy field like golf or piano.

But what I was realizing at this time was that I loved television. I watched the tv coverage of 9/11 as an elementary school student in awe, having just been to New York and learned about manhattan and the street grid and stuff and specifically asked my dad when we were at Ellis island looking back “what are those two huge buildings sticking up that don’t match the others? Why does only one of them have a smokestack (The iconic red and white twin towers antenna of course)?”

After this I began watching Peter Jennings every day on the news, and I began watching golf instead of practicing golf. I started paying closer attention to the broadcasting as I got into baseball and football. By the time of the “presidential inauguration” I had recorded myself announcing for the first time a few months earlier during Super Bowl 39, the first Pats-Eagles Super Bowl after the 2004 season in February 2005. 

After then “inauguration” elementary school was over.  I began mock announcing hundreds of sporting events a year at home, while at school I started realizing that being super diplomatic was not going to fly anymore and that my old nerdy friends were not going to help my get girls. So with my mind now set that my future was secure as a sports announcing prodigy, I set about trying to make myself popular. A growing problem was my mom because she was not letting me grow up and being overprotective, so I began to associate her nice diplomatic ways that she taught me with childlike naïvity, and I sought to counter that by becoming popular by denouncing my old friends and making overtures to a group of potential new friends by first trying to impress them by being “funny” (doing all sorts of weird crazy shit that was not funny), or being “evil” (mock-support for bad guys in any situation) which I saw as a counter to my mom’s influence.

I started a “coolest kid in school” ranking which of course I modestly put myself as tied 2nd, with two of the kids I was trying to become friends with tied for 1st and another one of them tied with me for 2nd.

The result was a disaster, as I basically was so oblivious that I let myself get played for a year before one of those kids let me down easy early the next year by telling me “hey we let you have fun with this last year but you need to leave us alone now, it’s not funny anymore”. So I first did the same cycle on a new group of kids that year, before they just ignored me enough that I cut my losses following a year. I also started realizing that the rest of my family besides my immediate is rich and began to notice little slights against my family by my cousins parents.

After that I tried to run back to my old friends but they wanted no part of it, plus I now had a reputation as a weirdo creep because of the things I had done the prior two years. 

There were only two of my old friends on my bus that would still talk to me, so I formed this gigantic mental crutch complex, a TV network named after myself, that in my imagination replaced Fox and had all its sports rights. I replaced all the daytime programming with “headcam” footage of my various life events. The two or three kids on my bus still nice enough to still talk to me humor my TV network by participating in “shows” at recess and on the bus. I would spend hours a day taking Fox Sports graphics and modifying them to have our names and my network logos, also taking the opportunity to “fix” anything I didn’t like about fox’s graphics package at the given time. I talked about going to Syracuse university and following in the footsteps of bob Costas or mike Tirico or Marv Albert. 

However this sports announcer/tv producer thing was becoming more and more of a mental crutch than an actual realistic career goal. I was something to hold me mentally together while I tried to rebuild my ruined personal life. After three years of the TV network thing, a tumultuous 5 years of middle school were over. When I walked in I was an A+ student who had loving friends, family, and a bright future as maybe a politician or a tv news anchor. When I walked out I was a C student with virtually no friends, an intentional Truman show complex to keep me sane, and a pipe dream to get into Syracuse university (top sports announcer school) which I couldn’t afford to go to. 

So I left the public schools to go to private catholic school and a fresh start. In the first months of high school I suffered another setback when I caught my dad trying to cheat again as I previously mentioned.

My only mission in high school was to first make sure I was the announcer, then to make friends. I did bit of those things quickly, so all of a sudden my personal life was back in order. I was back babyI started focusing on trying to get into Syracuse but my grades weren’t quite enough to get a scholarship. So I went to umass, a large rung down for sure in the sports world, and a not even on the map in the world of sports announcing.

So I was going to the zoo zoomass, woo! I started smoking weed and partying with my high school friends. Suddenly my personality completely changed. It was as if I had “woken up” from a deep sleep of aspbergers. Suddenly everything that had happened I could see from the point of view of a neurotypical person, as if the weed cured me of delusions. I could relate to people, whereas previously in high school I had been a happy tagalong. Now I could only feel my aspy level emotions when smoking weed, I feel neurotypical emotions otherwise unless it’s the morning right after I’ve smoked weed when my head is in a fog.


I was emerging socially as my own person with a real personality but the problem was that this personality began to hate and despise the aspy personality, and therefore forces like my mom and my family. Because being born to a family of outcasts and raised to be different, then having that family turn out to be fake, while my mom’s emotional, on/the-spectrum-level love for me makes my childhood spy personality burst out into tears thinking about how much I love my mom yet also thinking about how much my neurotypical personality despises and somewhat rudely tries to correct and fix my moms aspy sayings or behaviors. 

So I can only “feed” the aspy side of my personality by smoking weed, it’s the only way to feel my old emotions while indulging some of my aspy passions. At the same time, once I switch into that mode it’s very difficult to switch out. So over the last 5 years I’ve skipped work, school, family events, to get high, but then I feel like I’m letting my family down so I don’t even get the fulfillment of my aspy emotions for the day. As I have to fulfill my aspy emotions for about 4 hours a day, this leads me to continue trying by smoking more and more weed. So I wake up the next day in an aspy state which makes me unable to change into my neurotypical personality at work or school as I would automatically if I was sober, severely hurting my ability to network. At school I just didn’t show up for stuff even was the director of sports radio, something I’ve done a couple times at my real job but I don’t want to be fired so I’m careful. But this is some shitty temp job, I want to be a sports announcer but it’s all about connections and at school and at all my internships I was universally hated because I would never travel on team busses, when I had to use them I would be late, my conspiratorial and gallows sense of humor about everything, and my attitude that announcing is performance art like a pianist or a ballet dancer, and my tendency to relate everything to pro sports or politics. Like many artists and performers I can’t wait to drop the facade and get back to my introverted interests and my weed once the performance is over, after I have reviewed my own perforce of course. It’s about hitting all the cadences, making sure your calls are smooth, using creative transitions, not being repetitive, being self deprecating on the air, etc. My attention to all of these things is why I kept getting positions, I am great at the job. But two the other two kinds of people in the field are either stat geeks or ex athletes. The geeks are obsessed with the game and broadcast, the ex athletes are obsessed with music and girls and going out, meanwhile I’m interested in discussing how to exploit drama within the team to increase viewership (since I believe conflict and drama is what draws interest), professing my love for diva athletes and who have exploited the public love for drama to make money, planning future potential political endeavors by discussing ways to use the public’s own emotions to divide and conquer their loyalties, or simply talking about an imaginary future in which our whole broadcast and production team is working for like Fox or something.

So basically I’m scared to get an announcing job because my childhood personality is aspy and it’s so sad that my new personality knows too much about my old one and hates it and my family. This creates a feeling of self hatred and internal deadness that makes me not want to try hard and smoke weed all day to try and feel like it’s 2008 again. And then on top of being essentially a dead person who died 5 years ago in high school, my new personality *still* doesn’t even solve the problem of not being relatable, it did in high school but now it seems to clash with the personalities of other announcers as I just mentioned above. So what should I do? Should I got into politics and cut ties with something with so much personal baggage for me like sports announcing? Or no because my aspy personality is the better and more moral person and the real way to honor my mom would be to fulfill my dream of being a famous sports announcer and my mom’s dream of having me be a passionate and successful person (I used to call announcing my “passion”)? But politics, despite being dirty and ugly, would fulfill my goal of being able to have a voice in the media, and my parents other goal of me being remembered in history. Also my hairs now receding in my mid-20s so that’s another <mark>blow</mark> for sports announcer. So there’s a lot to consider. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;ll tell my problem with the relevant details on the people involved and the choice I&#x27;m facing. I&#x27;ll try to do so while doing two things: describe the things objectively; and describe how it affects me subjectively.

I&#x27;m trying to break contact with my family after ten years of being the scapegoat. This is partly my own fault, but for a great deal I was powerless and unfortunate when I made dumb decisions.

I&#x27;m 24 now and as a child I wasn&#x27;t at home as much as I found out the world is bigger then my parent&#x27;s restrictions.

When I was 14 I started to do worse in school due to the stress of having high expectations on school, high expectations of myself, and my parents having high expectations while failing to be good parents. At this time home was a shit place.

I won&#x27;t go as far as saying I&#x27;ve raised myself, because I do love my parents in a way and often glean wisdom/inspiration from their influence in the past.

When they (my parents) divorced they stopped looking after me, expecting that I&#x27;d land on my two feet... In fact they stopped paying attention to me at all, becoming more and more superficial and grim until I got kicked out. I started being more and more interested in exploring all things nobody should. Drugs, alcohol, small crime.

My dad doesn&#x27;t know the difference between moral objections and personal feuds, so contact with him has always been unpredictable, tense, and short. He seems to lack intuition and sensibility and he used to think it&#x27;s normal to threaten his children and he still does. The last time was about two years ago over the phone that he would come over and beat the shit out me. He as always had a drinking problem but somehow manages to hide his problems and show up at work sober every day. I can&#x27;t say that he isn&#x27;t a bad person in &quot;soceties&quot; way. In fact, it is this kind of discipline he&#x27;s been frustrated about that I can&#x27;t seem to mirror. I lack any discpline and have never learned to be a reliable person, which I loathe. I&#x27;m not blaming anyone here but my (unfortunate) self for this.

I have no idea how anyone can be around him. He can be nice, but there was always something he would do to make me feel bad, and is wasn&#x27;t always restricted to just emotional &quot;abuse&quot; as I call it, although I believe he never meant to hurt me, so I&#x27;m not going to say he ever physically abused me or attacked me, but he would be harsh. From his perspective, having three kids can be demanding, and as I have some developmental disorders, even though he&#x27;s never been diagnosed I know for sure he&#x27;s on the spectrum too. Not that it isn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s fault so it isn&#x27;t right to act out on your children. So I don&#x27;t entirely blame him or think of him as a bad man, he will never improve though and continue to lash out aggressively and behave despicably and impulsively. Of everyone I know, I am the only one who has ever expressed doubt or wanted to discuss dissatisfaction of my father, leaving me to think who he is at all, and if he is picking on me exclusively. Talking with my mother is futile as well, and maybe she has nothing substantial to say while she knows what&#x27;s going on, but I don&#x27;t know this. I tried talking........

I&#x27;m the youngest of three, my siblings being women. The oldest one seems like a full fledged narcissist. She&#x27;s been exposed for bullying, less so than my father, because it would be regular at home that the weakest would suffer the consequences of the day and everyone would react their frustration on them. I am undoubtedly intelligent, more so then her (at least she says), giving me an advantage to my academic-minded parents at times.

As the youngest I learned to be analytic, put my feelings aside to not get ridiculed, but I could not get away with the fact that I was, and will always be the youngest and easiest target.

My other sister still seems to live in some kind of fantasy that everything will someday be alright. To be honest I don&#x27;t fully trust her current boyfriend, who just seems *too* alright. But I don&#x27;t get involved. Anyway I&#x27;ve recently decided to cut her out as well as she&#x27;s shown unwillingness to have a honest conversation. She&#x27;s pretending that &quot;we&#x27;re friends&quot; and that there&#x27;s no need to be dissatisfied, keeping up this facade at critical moments that throws her pretensions in the water as, well, pretentious. 

I live on my own for a few years now, standing on my own feet despite being a social failure being a drop out and unable to maintain or even find a job. I try to make my life better by remaining sober and learn new skills, which works.

Adding to this, I&#x27;ve actively tried to give everyone a chance, hoping that they&#x27;d do the same. There&#x27;s been countless nights that everything seemed alright, getting together weekly for diner and all having a good time, like true quality time.

My intentions didn&#x27;t entirely go unanswered. Most people said to have understood the difficulties I&#x27;ve had to face, but substantially they weren&#x27;t supportive or willing to talk. I&#x27;ve kept good faith for a couple of years and also tried to show that reality is slightly different that expectations, and we should adapt, it is the best for everybody.

That didn&#x27;t work. 

As things got less easy I got back into the position of the black sheep, and I think that&#x27;s simply due to being less adaptable myself. I don&#x27;t fit in their frame of expectations, or they are not willing to accept me regardless, even if it is my true , imperfect nature.

Things progressed worse, while I maintained good intentions, and thought to have reached a state of mutual acceptance and forgiveness. As I&#x27;m never going back to the old me, or back to anything, this rigidness is then answered with a sherade of childishness. My mother, my sisters, my father, all actively seemed to have tried to take measures against my person, both independently as collectively, showing no willingness to talk, projecting their shit on me, leaving me incapable of a worthy, equal conversation. Maybe there is no such thing, but I&#x27;m not forcing it on them. I think it&#x27;s crucial, but they might think it&#x27;s futile.

My grandparents live in a village which would take seven hours to travel to by train. I&#x27;m working on getting my driver&#x27;s license, but I used to always take a seat with some kind of relative. In comparison it&#x27;s a three hour drive, the connection with public transit just happens to be awful.

I love my grandparents (the parents of my mother) and I never want to miss out. 

The only time I have missed out was when at my grandfather&#x27;s last birthday. I wasn&#x27;t invited and and everyone has neglected the opportunity to ask me to come. 

They&#x27;re getting old and I worry everyday. If I don&#x27;t get my driver&#x27;s license I might never see them again.

I found out that they skipped me about three days after the celebration. It was when my sister texted me to come to the pub. I told her maybe, that I still had to decide on what to eat and maybe later. Couple of hours later I was there and called her, not sure where it was. She was already gone.

That&#x27;s when I decided I had to show her how selfish she is because she&#x27;d pull these kind of tricks on me for the last year or more. I told her I walked there and I didn&#x27;t appreciate to show up and don&#x27;t find her there when responding to an invitation. The least she could have done was tell me that she relocated, change of plans, no big deal. She&#x27;s 26, she should know that.

That&#x27;s when she turned things around and blamed me for not being accessible to communications. That when she sends texts I don&#x27;t read them, or don&#x27;t respond to anyone else either.

Being me, I tried to maintain calmness and ask what she was implying specifically. I also tried to explain her earlier that week that it&#x27;s important to put your own interests firsts, when she vaguely was asking me for advice on what to do when people ask her about me. If they have something to say, I&#x27;m always here, always available. Something I&#x27;ve always said to all of them. Seems to have gone to deaf ears yet again.

She said that she was the only one to take the effort to &#x27;&#x27;invite&#x27;&#x27; me to come over to our grandparents that weekend. Here&#x27;s the joke: she sent an MMS.

My phone can&#x27;t open an MMS. And who does that anymore? And who invites someone like that? All this while pretending that she is not selfish, and that I should not have ignored her. I blame her though because she didn&#x27;t even call to check if I received her MMS. She didn&#x27;t drop by when she lives 1500m away from me.

If you&#x27;re making any claims to be my friend at that point, please piss yourself. That&#x27;s what I told her: you better not expect to see my face ever again. Don&#x27;t expect me to answer to anything you say ever. I don&#x27;t want to hear anything from her ever again. Don&#x27;t visit me, don&#x27;t call me, don&#x27;t text me, no emails. Go fuck yourself.

Why this reaction? Because for 24 years I&#x27;ve kept my cool during the most nerve wrecking situations and abhorrent betrayals.

I told her the week before she sent the MMS that I&#x27;d like to visit our grandparents again, politely inquiring if she saw an opportunity to plan a visit and take me with her in the car. She said yes and she would let me know, in fact she had the idea already herself. She KNEW I wanted to go. She even agreed.



Why can&#x27;t I face my grandparents? 

It should be easy, you say, I&#x27;m not on the wrong foot with them and never felt particularly anxious.

Well. They live in another country. I don&#x27;t speak to them much, I don&#x27;t see them much. We normally go to them and I&#x27;m going to have to find my own methods by now. This is probably the last time they&#x27;re coming over since the drive must be tiring, being in their 80s. 

I&#x27;ve promised myself to drop anyone who isn&#x27;t worthy of my time. Sounds selfish, and I admit it is. But it&#x27;s necessary to determine who I can trust, who doesn&#x27;t hurt me, who cares. I&#x27;m alone now, and have never been more confident and comfortable with myself. I&#x27;ve taken up driving lessons and several hobbies.

I&#x27;ve chosen to cut out those people after a gnarly &quot;friendship&quot; with a sociopath. This was when I was using drugs and skipping school and so on, too young to understand how ugly some people are on the inside. this person was of bad influence and I&#x27;m still facing the consequences. This taught me that nobody on the inside are necessarily who they are on the outside. I&#x27;ve taken advice from other stories on the internet that the only effective way to treat sociopaths is to completely ignore them to death.

That put some power back in my life. It was the only method I knew how to get back on top of things, and I started to treat everyting like this. If it affects me negatively, why let it into my life? This way I quit drugs, smoking, started to eat healthier and watch my step a little better. I don&#x27;t know any thing else right now.

Maybe my family feels like they&#x27;ve lost me and felt like that long before all this. But I feel like I&#x27;m singlehandedly being <mark>forced</mark> to take responsibility of a failed marriage, a broken family and a failed personal life while learning how to be an independent person the hard way.

My grandparents don&#x27;t come to visit *me*, I assume.

I live in a shelter for people who either don&#x27;t posses the inhibition to be self sufficient or have to be on the street otherwise. I think that on the other hand they&#x27;ll go to the house of my mother with her current spouse, the one who does seem to satisfy her unlike my dad. A place I&#x27;ve sworn never to visit. A place where people will be who I&#x27;ve sworn not to grant a second of my time.

People who I don&#x27;t want to see, don&#x27;t want to think about. People who I don&#x27;t care about. A place I don&#x27;t care about. Bad memories and feeling shit are guaranteed. I know for sure that If I go, I&#x27;ll be harassed again for the next couple of months or years, being the only one to have shown integrity, selflessness and responisbility.

I know this because my sister texted me this, while I&#x27;ve sworn not to read her text I&#x27;m also pretending not to know anything. Suffices to say I didn&#x27;t react and I can take this any direction I want.

I want people to take some responsibility for their own wants and needs, and not put someone else in that position. If they don&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t get myself to cope with it. I can&#x27;t lie to myself like that. Why must I be the one to be emotionally matured enough to understand this? Why do they tread on me for this for being pushed into the position of hero?

I&#x27;ve taken more shit than anyone and there could&#x27;t have been no alternative. 

What do I do, put myself aside again, taking all the shit again, just to see my grandparents? Heck, the way they&#x27;re getting all along I wont be surprised if my sanctimonious father will show up as well and that everyone will be their ignorant, fake-happy lying &quot;selves&quot; again. I&#x27;ve never understood or cared for that.

Is it worth it? Do I let my own pride get in my way? 

Do I throw my hands up not caring like I think I should? 

I&#x27;m thinking maybe there should be a concession. 

A solution would be to call them to try and determine at what time they&#x27;re planning on being there, so that I can choose to be at the earliest or last moment there to either greet them or say goodbye, and split the second too many people show up all the while pretending to be happy about everything and complimenting my mother on having to get herself a really nice house and a happy life.

I can&#x27;t say she doesn&#x27;t deserve that I really do wish the best for her. I&#x27;m just hurt myself and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for me to go to that place. I think she knows because she&#x27;s never unnecessarily harassed me, unlike other people, she&#x27;s been accepting a lot of my shit in return, me having been a lying, criminal drug addict, taking me in when I got kicked out my dad&#x27;s. Must hurt to see your child loose their innocence like that and my father has also expressed grief.

I&#x27;m not very happy now.

I feel like no matter what I do I&#x27;m going to regret it. 

Edit to add what awaits me:

Dad: Did you get the money I sent you? (I never asked for)

Sister: *<mark>blow</mark>s smoke in my face, reminds me of the opportunities I&#x27;ve missed which she&#x27;s delighted in taking respononsibility for, smothers me because she thinks she&#x27;s hot shit after noticing i&#x27;m not flinching*

Other Sister: *is going to harass anyone who isn&#x27;t happy*

Mother: *is happy*

Spouse of mother: *wondering if he should be happy I&#x27;m there, oh well why not*

Grandparents: *are glad everyone is there*.

Oh well the last bit seems worth it so I guess I&#x27;ll drop by for a second.

Me: *leaves just about when everyone is going to start to blame me for the end of the world, says everything will be better, fuck this never coming back*</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">TL;DR at the very end in case you dont want to read my wall o&#x27; text.

Throw away account obviously, but I am at kind of a moral crossroads.

I work for a small company doing IT work. The entire staff is somewhere around 60 or 80 people. We have a systems admin that basically runs every aspect of IT (we will call him Satan), two desktop techs (myself and another person, we will call her Sandy). The desktop techs are required to do all the break/fix as well as building new machines to go out to client sites as well as general helpdesk for all of the office and a handful of remote users.

We also have to be on call for afterhours questions or issues from our clients (we get paid handsomely for each call).

Here is the problem: Sandy is a bit of a slut. Sandy started fucking one of our co workers and got found out by her husband (her husband and I are friends on Facebook). Sandy is also very petty. Sandy outright refuses to help certain co workers that have at any point in time crossed her or pissed her off, she simply will not do it. She has been <mark>forced</mark> to draft apologies for <mark>blow</mark>ing up and screaming at co workers (its a real common occurrence). All the people she refuses to help come to me for assistance and being from a background that puts customer service above all, I always help them regardless of what I&#x27;m doing (lunch or what have you).

Sandy is almost never available when people are looking for her, shes hiding somewhere in the company usually around the co worker she is fucking. Storage rooms, server rooms, what have you.

Sandy is now super pissed at me because I still talk to her ex husband (hes a cool dude) and she wants me to cut all ties with him simply because we are co workers. Did I mention shes REALLY petty and childish?

Sandy is also a bit of a suck up to Satan, our admin and for all intents and purposes IT director.

Satan favors Sandy and basically lets her get away with murder. If Sandy builds a workstation and its been half assed but I wind up deploying it to a desk for a new employee with a big fat note on the front that says &quot;ready to deploy&quot; its my ass. Satan comes down on me and gives me a ton of shit for it, when I explain that it was Sandys half assed build out Satan literally just murmurs to himself and walks away.

Sandy has no IT certifications nor has made any attempt to try and get any certifications. However Satan has made it his personal mission to take Sandy under his wing and start grooming her to be a Jr Admin, Satan however will not afford me the same benefit and allow me to learn new things. Satan is content with me doing bitch work forever.

Anyway, back to Sandy. Sandys husband informed me one night that Sandy asked Satan for overtime. The reason being is Sandy has a boy with her husband and her husband is getting the boy in the divorce. Sandy cant afford to live her current lifestyle without extra money so hence why she asked for overtime. Satan shot Sandy down and said no, apparently Sandy went and cried (literally cried in his office) to Satan about how she was going to have to get a second job and it was just so horrible, Satan then relented and gave sandy overtime on demand ......... for life. As much OT as she wants to work ..... forever.

So we have Sandy who if my napkin math is right got basically a 15 or 20k raise in the form of unlimited overtime for life.

We have Satan who plays favorites, lets Sandy take all the afterhours calls, refuses to believe she is fallible and is ridiculously cheap. Satan wont buy a 20 dollar software license so one of our best developers can work a little easier but will treat himself, Sandy and her new boyfriend to expensive swanky lunches over 100 dollars on the companies dime (yes really). Not to mention giving an extremely argumentative and poor worker free money simply because they are buds.

Heres the wrinkle:

No one in IT likes Satan, we have had a rash of people from IT leaving our company recently and the owner of the company is getting worried about it. I have it on good authority that the only people that know about Sandys OT is Satan, Sandy and HR. The company owner does not know. The company president and owner is a VERY likeable guy, you can walk into his office sit down and simply start shooting the shit with him about sports scores or new movies or anything. He is super approachable and nice but he is not a push over. Several people in the company have gotten raises or new positions by petitioning directly to him over the years and making very good cases on why they should get what they are asking for.

Ive come to a place where I am looking for a new job, I have some offers from other places lined up however I would love to stay where I am at if at all possible. One of our IT staff is leaving soon, this person .... we will call him David, we had a very heated argument once. However our argument never once influenced my willingness to help him when he needed help, I unlike Sandy don&#x27;t blackball our employees simply because we had a disagreement.

David is meeting with the company president before he leaves so the president can pick his brain on why we are hemorrhaging staff from IT. David wrote me a GLOWING letter of recommendation detailing how I have always been professional and polite and helpful with him even though we have had our differences.

Several other people in the company have also written me very generous letters of recommendation.

We finally come to it. My question.

After David primes our president and tells him during his exit interview that the reason we are hemorrhaging IT staff is because Satan is kind of a prick, he runs the department like its his personal plaything and everyone hates him.

Should I meet with our president, inform him of Sandys OT that was generously given to her by Satan and thus throw Sandy and Satan under the bus? Then follow up with this proposal: I request a raise in the amount of 15k, plus complete ownership of the oncall system from this point forward so I can be a better tech and learn all the issues that come in.

In return, I agree to not ask for another raise or bonus for the next 4 years and will bring him one new certification each year and will begin priming myself to take over job responsibilities from Satan.

A co worker that has petitioned our president in such a manner successfully has coached me that this is the best way to do it with our president. He wants some kind of tit for tat, you will give me this because in return I will do this for you.

With David telling the president that basically hes running the IT dept into the ground and me informing him that Satan is playing with his money like its his own, I think I have a decent proposal.

The only wrinkle is, I dont know what will happen to Satan or Sandy or HR for that matter. He might fire them, I don&#x27;t know.

TL;DR: IT Director is a shitty person, is giving free OT to an employee with a bad work ethic simply because they are friends and I can possibly get a substantial raise by throwing both of them under the bus. What do?

            <div class="content collapsed">I grew up very religious and very awkward. I had a difficult time making friends, and I only mention that because it helps explain how deeply I became sucked into religion in high school.

I enjoyed being part of my church&#x27;s youth group because they were so ready and willing to accept confused teenagers. They made me feel less like a weirdo and more like a weirdo with a calling. Now, before I make all churches out to be predatory institutions, looking for dumb kids to keep their ship afloat, let me just say that a lot of the people I met and experiences I had during this time were very meaningful to me. I may not be convinced that modern day Christianity is a positive influence on this world, but I&#x27;ve seen some of the sentiment getting passed around those circles actually do some good from time to time. 

Thinking I had found my calling in life, I went to College to study Theology, and spent the next four years becoming increasingly worried that I couldn&#x27;t handle being a Youth Minister like I had planned. 

I have always been a glass-half-empty sort of guy, and I spent a great deal of my time in college wrestling with the problems I began discovering I had with Christian culture and the Christian faith in general. Where was the evidence? Why were so many of my friends and classmates ready to believe such wild stuff without any reason? Why was so much of this based in fear and hate? Unfortunately, I never found my answers and spent the last year in college just hoping I would find a position at a very liberal church that could save what was left of my allegiance to the Christian tradition. 

I got married right out of college and found a job doing tech support for a cable company that I only planned to keep while I looked for a Youth Ministry position in the area. But after six months there, during which my wife became very ill and spent a month in the hospital, I was incredibly depressed and ended up quitting one morning when I just couldn&#x27;t force myself into the car. 

My wife and I were <mark>forced</mark> to move back in with my parents, and I started looking for other jobs right away, figuring we would only be there a few months. Six months later, I was still unemployed and struggling even worse with depression. I remember spending night after night in prayer, asking God to soften the <mark>blow</mark>s life was dealing, but I never received any indication that anyone was listening... and for the first time in my life I asked myself how I was positive that someone was.

Completely ignoring my crisis of faith, I managed to find a part-time, volunteer position as a Youth Ministries Director at a church in the area, but they weren&#x27;t exactly strengthening my ties to the Church. Their theology was wonky, their methodology was cringeworthy, and I had a difficult time finding ideological common ground with anyone there. 

The church couldn&#x27;t pay me, so I continued searching for employment. I eventually found a full-time job working in the customer service department at a music marketing company, but it began making me miserable right away. 

For one, the job <mark>blow</mark>s. I&#x27;m constantly being treated like an imbecile by both our clients and my boss (even though I continue to display a better understanding of how our company operates than she does), and I go home everyday feeling useless and dejected. Beyond that, the pastor at the church where I was working seemed to be dissatisfied with the amount of time I was able to volunteer once my life became noticeably centered around a 9-5 job. Any positive aspects of our relationship began to deteriorate as his lack of gratitude pushed me even further from a place of comparability with their church. 

I ended up leaving my position at the church after fourteen months. I decided I wasn&#x27;t doing anyone, including myself, any good by volunteering what little time I was able, and encouraged the church to hire someone with more time and energy to spare. 

With some room to breathe, I finally began focusing on my own health. During this time, all the unanswered questions I had about religion came flooding back to me, and for the first time I didn&#x27;t feel compelled to defend it. 

At this point, I knew that I couldn&#x27;t work in a church. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable enough regulating my thoughts and opinions to work with vulnerable kids whose parents simply wanted me to regurgitate their ideals in a hip environment once a week. Beyond developing a distaste for youth ministry though, I had lost all desire to continue my commitment to the Christian God without a solid reason for doing so. I just couldn&#x27;t account for all the inconsistencies between the real world in front of me and the way the world had been described within the context of the Christian faith. After spending almost 20 years as an active member of the Christian Church, I had finally reached the place most kids get to when they turn 18. I&#x27;d lost all desire to step through the doors of even one more place of worship. 

It&#x27;s been six months since I walked away from that church, and I feel worse-off than ever. Without my faith, I have a degree that&#x27;s less useful than an art diploma. I don&#x27;t have any special skills that qualify me for a cool job so my future&#x27;s not looking so bright. The private Christian college I attended wasn&#x27;t cheap either, so I&#x27;m buried in student load debt. Even though I&#x27;m on anti-depressants, I still find myself wondering if I can keep this lifestyle up for the next 40-50 years without seeing myself out. What can I do to turn things around? I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was excited to wake up in the morning, and I&#x27;d love to be in a place a year from now where that&#x27;s a possibility. Sorry if this is heavy, but I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here. 

Thanks for reading if you did. 
Otherwise TL;DR - I grew up religious, went to college to be a pastor, ended up hating it, and now I&#x27;m an atheist who doesn&#x27;t see much to look forward to. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">A little backstory:

We were visiting our hometown for christmas, my wife&#x27;s family lives there and my mother lives close to there so it&#x27;s the best place for everyone to get together over the holidays. We normally stay at my wife&#x27;s parents place over the holidays and visit family and friends, and my mom comes into town and comes over for xmas eve and xmas dinner and things.
This year, my mom decided to leave the festivities on xmas eve because &quot;nobody was talking to her&quot;, she then decided not to come over christmas day because &quot;too many people would be there&quot;. 

She only has one grandchild - my son who is 6 with autism, and she barely knows anything about his life because she talks about nothing but herself. I suspect she has actual Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

Anyhow, the xmas events, coupled with the fact she didn&#x27;t even call for my son&#x27;s birthday made me angry, and I told her so. She came up with multiple excuses, blamed me for everything, and hung up on me twice. She said many nasty things to me, claiming I must have marital problems, or other external factors to being angry. I told her no, it was just her and restated the reasons why.

I sent her an e-mail saying I wanted to fix our relationship but I was unwilling to take all of the blame anymore and I wanted her to apologize and perhaps she should see someone. That I would support her through therapy, but I wanted no more bullying or abuse from her.

This started off a chain reaction of e-mails where she was progressively more blameworthy, with no attempt to apologize or make it right, always pointing the finger elsewhere. 

After one particularly nasty e-mail, I told her to stop bullying me, she is the only problem, please listen to me (it will be posted below). And then afterwards I sent another e-mail restating that the events over christmas and birthday were the reason I was mad, I just wanted an apology or for her to get help.

This resulted in the following e-mail:
  
&gt;*&quot;If you&#x27;ve been listening to anything I have to say, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation. I&#x27;d 
&gt;love to hear your theory. I&#x27;ve been to therapy, twice already.  You are just trying to bully 
&gt;me into believing you again, please stop. Please listen. You are the problem, nothing 
&gt;else. Nobody in their right mind would say the things you have said or are saying to me. 
&gt;Please stop.”*
&gt;
&gt;So this is what it has come to … honestly *[cutoutmymom]*, this is the wildest thing I have ever read.
&gt;All of the issues listed, in the e-mail following this one, have already been rehashed 
&gt;enough.  I spent hours writing responses to each, and every issue you listed, but in the 
&gt;end, I just hit delete because I realized that it just wasn’t important anymore by the time I 
&gt;finished this letter.
&gt;
&gt;I realized that your list was nothing more than just a “new” collection of gripes which 
&gt;continue to pile up.  Our situation has nothing to do with these “new” issues, but with an 
&gt;old underlying problem.  The root of the problem stems from “unresolved issues” that 
&gt;unfortunately were not dealt with properly.
&gt;
&gt;The most prominent “unresolved issue” is the hysteria that took place when you first 
&gt;brought [son] home for a visit to [hometown].  I feel that this single issue was the 
&gt;boulder that toppled and started our relationship tumbling down into a major landslide.  
&gt;Why?  Because, what you “perceived” to have occurred that day, has had a major 
&gt;influence on completely altering your overall perception of me, and since that day, you 
&gt;have continued to “judge” me according to that distorted “perception”.
&gt;The entire experience was shocking and upsetting beyond belief for me.  It was also the 
&gt;day you screamed at me in an absolute rage and told me “You are not welcome in my 
&gt;family!  I am in control of MY family and only I know what is right for MY family!”  
&gt;Then you packed up and left for [wife]’s parents place and left me crying.  I couldn’t 
&gt;stop crying, and I was still crying the next day, and called you.  You showed me no 
&gt;compassion whatsoever and just said “quit acting like a drama queen”.  That visit was 
&gt;one of the most painful experiences of my life.  I could not understand what I had done 
&gt;that was SO wrong to be treated like that.  It made absolutely no sense to me at all!
&gt;I just realized, as I typed the above paragraph, that you said that exact same things to me 
&gt;in our last telephone conversation.  “I am in control of MY family and only I know what 
&gt;is right for MY family!” and as well when you brought me to tears you said “quit acting 
&gt;like a drama queen” along with a snicker in your voice.  It totally shattered me and I hung 
&gt;up on you.  Do you not think that it is odd that you are still using the exact same words, 
&gt;with the same lack of emotion, and callousness that you expressed to me six long years 
&gt;ago?
&gt;
&gt;My theory, which you said you “would love to hear”, has to do with the fact that I 
&gt;finally discovered that I am not alone in experiencing this type of hysteria with a son and 
&gt;daughter-in-law, even more so with a son and daughter-in-law with a new child.  The 
&gt;knowledge gave me some solace, but at the same time it upset me because I knew if I 
&gt;brought this subject up, it would most likely be my death sentence.  That said, your anger 
&gt;has escalated to the point of no return, which is quite evident in the above e-mail.  So I 
&gt;am going to attempt to present what I think fractured our relationship.
&gt;I thought long and hard about our relationship for months now and I have spent countless 
&gt;days going back in time, sifting through each and every issue I am aware of.  Each <mark>blow</mark> 
&gt;up did not make sense to me then, and still does not make sense to me now.  So what 
&gt;was really been going on?  It was making me crazy!  I finally decided to go over it all 
&gt;… again, and began a “new search” by focusing in on when I first began to feel hostility 
&gt;from you.
&gt;
&gt;I would like you to think back to me visiting you out in Vancouver when you were 
&gt;out there on your own *[cutoutmymom]*.  I thought we had a wonderful time.  Did we fight about 
&gt;anything?  No.  Do you remember staying in the motel in Victoria?  We had a great time 
&gt;and I don’t recall any hostility whatsoever.  But as we move forward in time, “issues” 
&gt;began to start erupting that just didn’t make sense to me.  I began to feel like I was being 
&gt;hyper-analyzed by you and started feeling more, and more uncomfortable on each visit.  
&gt;I felt like I couldn’t say, or do anything, that was not taken and twisted into something 
&gt;negative and resulting in a “big issue”.  It increasingly began to bother me to the point 
&gt;that I actually became nervous when I planned a visit.
&gt;Did you know that most “mother-in-law / daughter-in-law” relationships are considered 
&gt;to be “just tolerable”?  Please Google it for yourself.  It was quite the eye opener for me!
&gt;It apparently is a “syndrome” that has been around since the beginning of time and is 
&gt;very well documented throughout history.  This “syndrome” affects the new wife on a 
&gt;subconscious level and the brain actually “interprets” the “mother/son relationship” as if 
&gt;it were actually a “romantic relationship”.  The wife reacts to this “perceived affair” with 
&gt;irrational jealous behaviour targeted at the mother-in-law.  Everything the mother-in-law 
&gt;says, or does, no matter how innocent, is “perceived” as a “direct threat or attack” by the 
&gt;wife’s brain and she reacts accordingly.    These “perceptions” are extremely damaging to 
&gt;the “mother/son relationship” because the son is caught between his wife, and his mother, 
&gt;and is basically <mark>forced</mark> to CHOOSE between them.  His wife takes him behind closed 
&gt;doors and makes a scene about his mother.  She tells him that his mother is threatening 
&gt;her, making her feel uncomfortable and whatever else she may “perceive” and then he 
&gt;reacts in anger against his mother to defend his wife.  Meanwhile, the mother hasn’t done 
&gt;anything wrong but ends up being severely punished for the “perceived attacks”.  Sadly 
&gt;the mother ends up being pushed away, and more often than not, she is permanently put 
&gt;on the back burner.  The son continues to distance himself from his mother because of 
&gt;his wife’s extreme discomfort, when his mother is around, and eventually becomes more 
&gt;involved with his wife’s family because that is what makes his wife “happy”.   

&gt;As I read stories from other mother-in-laws, I could barely believe what I was reading.  
&gt;They were all stating the same things I had been saying over, and over again, for years 
&gt;now.  Statements such as:  “Visits became uncomfortable with a underlying feeling 
&gt;of hostility” “Every time I went for a visit, I felt like I was walking on egg shells” 
&gt;“Everything I said or did was twisted into something negative”  “I felt pushed away” “It 
&gt;made me feel like I was going crazy as it just didn’t make sense” “I have to compete with 
&gt;her family to see my own son” ... the comments went on, and on, and on …
&gt;With this new train of thought, I decided to go back through everything, once more, 
&gt;and apply this “syndrome” to see if it would fit.  The pieces of the puzzle began to fall 
&gt;into place and actually made sense, out of complete nonsense.   It became quite clear to 
&gt;me what I was actually up against.  It meant that the underlying problem did not even 
&gt;develop between “YOU and I” at all!  You were caught in the middle, taking all the 
&gt;heat and lashing out at me in anger, and I was constantly confused as to why this was 
&gt;happening!  What did I do?  What did I say?  This is why it is SO confusing to you as 
&gt;well *[cutoutmymom]*, because you have been made to believe that I am some horrific person, when 
&gt;in fact, deep down in your heart, you know that isn’t true.  Your heart is telling you 
&gt;the “truth” and the “perceived data” in your brain is blocking your heart.  That is why 
&gt;you feel so distraught.  Always trust your heart *[cutoutmymom]*.  I have not changed.  I am just the 
&gt;same old me that I always have been.  Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but 
&gt;definitely not horrific. 
&gt;
&gt;If you play out that first visit with [son], in your mind *[cutoutmymom]*, what do you see happening?  
&gt;What was the actual issue?  Was the issue catastrophic enough to damage our relationship 
&gt;for life?  Did I actually purposely, and with malice, intentionally hurt [wife]?  Or did I 
&gt;just act like a new grandmother trying to help?  What was discussed behind closed doors?  
&gt;How was it said?  How did you react as a result?  Only you know the real truth *[cutoutmymom]*, as 
&gt;I was not privy to your private conversations.  To this very day, I still don’t even know 
&gt;what I did, or said, that was “SO WRONG” to deserve the aftermath that ensued.
&gt;I am not an evil person *[cutoutmymom]*.  I have never done anything intentionally to hurt either you, 
&gt;or [wife].  I am very sorry that this whole mess happened.  But now at least, it makes 
&gt;some sense.  The THREE OF US were caught up in an age old situation that literally 
&gt;exploded on that visit and has caused nothing but continuous damage ever since.  You 
&gt;continue to “judge” me because of “it”, whatever “it” was, and I, reacted by being 
&gt;confused and angry at my irrational treatment.  Then I just kept backing away, further, 
&gt;and further, and this is where we stand today.  Smack in the middle of a great big mess.
&gt;So, now you think, that because I have distanced myself so far from you, that it MUST 
&gt;MEAN that I don’t care about my family, which couldn’t be further from the truth!  I 
&gt;want nothing more than to have my family back, but each and every day that this hateful 
&gt;carryon continues, another precious day is wasted, that I could be spending with my one 
&gt;and only grandson.  It is time for YOU to stop!
&gt;
&gt; “You are the problem, nothing else” You can blame me all you like *[cutoutmymom]*, till you are 
&gt;blue in the face, but for what purpose?  Does that solve anything?  No, it does not.  It is 
&gt;a very deep problem that got us here in the first place and what I am trying to tell you is 
&gt;that we are not the only ones in the world with this problem.  In fact it is more common 
&gt;than not!  The whole thing is just SO STUPID when you look at it objectively.  ALL this 
&gt;time wasted, ALL the hurt, ALL the pain, ALL the division, because of some ridiculous, 
&gt;stupid, subconscious factor that blind sided us all.  Man, I wish I knew about this a long, 
&gt;long, time ago.  
&gt;
&gt;If it is even worth anything to you at this point, I just want you to know that I am still 
&gt;willing to put this behind us and move forward if that is ever possible.  The door will 
&gt;be open when, and if, you are ready to treat me once again with respect and see me as 
&gt;I truly am.  Whether you can put this whole thing to rest and begin to move forward, 
&gt;still remains to be seen.  Your decision will ultimately make, or break, our family 
&gt;relationship.  If you can’t move forward then I guess, it is time for me to say goodbye to 
&gt;my family.  I tried my best and I can do nothing more.
&gt;
&gt;I am physically and mentally exhausted and I can barely function.  I have to somehow 
&gt;pull up my socks and get on with life, because I have a business to run and can no longer 
&gt;deal with this constant upset.  It is just too painful for me.  I would greatly appreciate a 
&gt;break now for a well needed cool off period.
&gt;
&gt;Just remember *[cutoutmymom]*, that no matter what you do, and no matter how hard you try, you 
&gt;cannot change the past.  You can only learn from it and move forward.
&gt;I am truly sorry for all the pain I have caused you *[cutoutmymom]* and I hope you can pull up your 
&gt;socks as well, and just focus on taking good care of your family.
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;Mom

For reference, the &#x27;initial&#x27; issue my mom is referring to is when she tried to grab my wife&#x27;s breast during breastfeeding, citing that perhaps she was not properly utilizing the force of gravity to aid in milk flow (it was already pointing down). 

So, what do I do? Really? I will be bringing the letter to a therapist in a week. I&#x27;m seeing a psychotherapist over this for the 1st time in my life (my next appointment will be appt #3) The therapist advised me I was setting healthy boundaries with her.  I don&#x27;t know how to get over this without cutting her out of my life completely. This is all because I got mad at her for her behaviour in the past few months. She has sent me multiple e-mails impugning my character, and now, she has targeted my wife while grasping at the few good times we had in the past 10 years. My wife and I have been together for 17 years and are happy as can be. Multiple people have advised me to cut mom out of my life, but I only want to do this as a last resort. 

I think she needs mental help, but if she won&#x27;t listen to me, who will she listen to? She&#x27;s quite normal to most people and only reserves this level of crazy for me. She has done the same thing to my uncle (claiming my aunt is poisoning him against her), but he doesn&#x27;t want to get involved (and I don&#x27;t blame him). 

I&#x27;m at a loss around what to do. 

Is anyone in a similar situation? What did you do? I&#x27;ve been told to never speak to her again, or maybe just send her 2 e-mails a year on her birthday and on christmas...

Sorry for the wall of text, I thought it was important to include the whole letter.

            <div class="content collapsed">TW: MENTIONS OF SA, ABUSE AND MORE. 

Social media is the biggest influence we have in today&#x27;s society, and a lot if not all I see when it comes speaking out against abuse and abusers, it&#x27;s always women bringing awareness that more men are abusers. 

Other women say &quot;well men need to speak up about themselves and advocate for themselves like we did&quot; but something y&#x27;all don&#x27;t understand is that they can&#x27;t. Because other women AND OTHER MEN tear them down. 

I can&#x27;t tell you how many posts I&#x27;ve seen on Reddit, tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter of men TRYING to talk about their experiences with abusive men AND women, and they seem to have the entire globe in their comments saying &quot;men can&#x27;t be abused&quot; or &quot;men can&#x27;t be assaulted, because they&#x27;re stronger they can just force others off&quot; 

Let me put it into a simple comparison, if women can get drugged and SA&#x27;d, MEN CAN TO. But people seem to forget that as soon as a man tries to speak up. Hell there was a huge <mark>blow</mark> out on tiktok for a bit because a famous female influencer drugged a man and SA&#x27;d him while he was passed out. There was video proof. And people were still defending the woman, saying he liked it because he had a crush on her, or he wanted it because he got hard. 

Consent isn&#x27;t just for women. As a woman that&#x27;s been SA&#x27;d by men, I&#x27;ve worked through my trauma on my own time. I know other women work through it differently, but blaming all men, or straight up ignoring or even bullying other men for THEIR experiences is not &quot;working through your trauma&quot; 

Trying to be a hypocrite and treating the male victims like other men treated you when you came out about it is NOT working through your trauma. It&#x27;s only hurting other victims. Because women are not the only ones being abused. 

And it rlly doesnt help when other men want to tear each other down by calling the victims &quot;lucky&quot; because a woman wanted to show them some attention. It&#x27;s sick, it&#x27;s disgusting. Men can&#x27;t come out with their stories because they have the entire world against them. While at least the ladies have their ladies to back them up. And yes, I know there are shitty women that are out there acting just as bad as the shitty men who say women are lying to.  But that&#x27;s less common than women AND men coming after other men who try to come out about their stories of abuse.

Yes, there are shitty men, yes there are more men that abuse others than women that abuse others, but there&#x27;s also men who advocate for womens rights, there&#x27;s men that stand up against other male abusers, there&#x27;s men protecting women from other men&#x27;s roofies, and yes... There are men that get SA&#x27;d and Abused by other men... AND WOMEN. 

Just because there&#x27;s less, doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s a reason to disregard, bully, shame and abuse men who go through it. 

And I know this is falling on deaf ears because LITERALLY every other time I try to talk about this, I get called a pick me by other women. It&#x27;s always &quot;girls supporting girls&quot; until one of them breaks out of the misandry mindset...</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I’m so frustrated and fed up I don’t know what to do.

I feel like every time I bring up the issue of the disproportionate amount of chores and helping around the house compared to my twin sister and I, it always gets turned around on me and I’m the bad guy and the issue never gets solved. It feels like nobody *listens* to me or even tries to understand the point I’m trying to make.

I’m just so fed up. 

We still live at home with the parents, and it feels like they always take her side or don’t do anything in order to avoid one of her infamous <mark>blow</mark> ups because she lives in delulu land and goes into screaming and crying fits anytime she’s yelled at or <mark>forced</mark> to help with a chore she doesn’t want to do around the house.

She’s on Prozac because of her depression but I don’t think she’s taking it or it’s not the right medication for her because it doesn’t seem to be doing anything and she gets manic so easily. 

Anyway, because we’re the only two left in the house out of five siblings in total, all the house maintenance fell on us. My dad has a disability, our mom works to support the house hold, and we live with our grandmother who is in her 90s plus three dogs.

I’ve quite literally been a fucking care taker for the past three years.

Cleaning, taking care of the dogs and grandma, and cooking all somehow fell on my shoulders all while I juggled school and college work. Simply because she couldn’t be bothered to help. My sister has a habit of staying up all night and <mark>sleeping</mark> all day and gets very cranky if she’s woken up, and nobody wanted to deal with that hassle, so that only left me to take care of everything. 

I’ve become the reliable one and it’s draining. Like, the fact that anytime my dad needs anything he always calls me first is proof of this. He never calls my sister for anything unless I’m already doing something else. 

I now work a full time job while my sister goes to college two days a week and the rest are online classes and is an “influencer” and gets some money from doing TikTok shop videos as her “job”. She’s also going to school for theatre and is working on her bachelors having just gotten her associates last month. 

Don’t even get me started on her using her rehearsals as a way to get out of doing everything for the past two years. 

Since I’m working full time now, and even a little before then, I’ve cut back a lot on some of the stuff I used to do. In truth, it’s because I’m so fucking tired. I’ve become resentful of doing the littlest things for my grandmother, resentful that I don’t get to have as much free time as my sister because if I don’t do something then nobody will. 

I get it. I’m not a perfect person and I admit there is more I could do to help around the house and make the load easier on my mom, but I just don’t have any energy left in me.

I mean, why should it all be up to me to make sure the downstairs is cleaned, the dogs get fed, grandma gets her medicine and showered and there’s food on the table?

Did they ever stop to think there’s a reason why I’m always trying to eat out so I don’t have to cook a large meal for everyone and then clean it up afterwards? 

I’m one singular fucking person. I have a life, or rather want to have one, but I’m stuck inside all the time. Why does it all have to fall on me when there is another just as capable human being living in the house?

And it’s infuriating. Because she gets a pat on the back and atta-boy for doing THE BARE MINIMUM. At times in the summer when I bring up the issue and am overwhelmed by the amount of inside house work, my dad literally praises her for helping him with the pool. AND THATS ALL SHE DOES. Skim the pool, empty the baskets, and do a few water tests and then she’s free to do nothing the rest of the day. Like it’s so sad, she has to be praised and treated like a toddler in order to get her to keep doing the bare minimum.

Meanwhile I’m inside, doing the dishes, cleaning the counters, cleaning the kitchen, dining room, living room, bathroom, sweeping and mopping the floors, organizing the pantry, cleaning the laundry room, cleaning my grandmothers room. I ask for help with doing the garbage and she says no. I end up getting yelled by my dad that it’s not my place when she throws a fit when I press her to help me and then she’s congratulated on “all her hard work”. 

Garbage night is always a hassle because I’ll ask her for help and she’ll <mark>blow</mark> up. When it’s her week she doesn’t even bother emptying half the trash cans and never refills the garbage bags in my parent’s room. 

THATS ANOTHER THING- when she does do chores she doesn’t do them properly. And she *knows* how to do them properly!

She just shoves dirty dishes in the dishwasher not bothering to rinse them, she never cleans the counters, never sweeps. I’m pretty sure she deliberately doesn’t clean things properly because she’s trying to get my parents to not ask her to do it anymore. They haven’t but she still just keeps doing it *wrong*. And whenever I point it out she just cusses me out. 

Not to mention she literally hits me when I piss her off enough to do one little thing. All the while she’s mumbling under her breath about my “god complex”. 

Yeah fucking right. Sorry for asking you to contribute to the household you live in. 

And it’s aggravating because I know she has it in her to do a good job, but she’s just a lazy bum and doesn’t want to do anything.  She has potential but she doesn’t use it.

I want to be a lazy fucking bum but I’m not allowed to. Because then that would leave my mom to do it and she already has enough on her plate.

But she’s not innocent either. She’s complacent with my sister’s behavior and just doesn’t confront her or do anything about the issue. Once it reaches a boiling point, she just <mark>blow</mark>s up and starts yelling and guilt tripping. 

I’m just so fucking over it and done.

I’ve tried moving out. It was nice while it lasted but I got screwed over and now I’m in debt. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like there’s no winning. I just want to go on strike and show everyone just how much I really do around here. 

If you read all that, thanks I appreciate it. Writing this all out really helped make me feel better. Anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">
i don’t understand what it is in her head. maybe it was the way she was raised, or her views on certain issues and topics, but i can’t take the emotional and mental obstacles anymore, especially if my partner becomes the center of it. my mom neversss speaks the way she does about my partner in front of them, and yet nothing but passive aggression, resentment, jealousy and all of the fucking above comes out of her life a fucking vomit. (keep in mind this has been happening for well over a year)

my partner constantly and relentlessly shows respect to this grown ass woman even after they have been called a slut, “a bad influence”, a bitch etc… The amount of times i’ve came to this woman to talk to her about the concerns my partner has and my mom would just <mark>blow</mark> me away. this woman has never been there for me, emotionally mentally or barely even physically if she is not at work.

 whenever I have an issue and I come to my mother about it, it gets <mark>blow</mark>n away. I come to her with concerns about my well-being it’s not taken seriously, but whenever I turn around and I don’t speak to her for a few weeks I get called ungrateful. when I step up to her whenever she comes incorrect to me I get called disrespectful, and it doesn’t help that I have family members coming up to me after every altercation saying that I should respect my mother more or that I should be grateful for my mother because I only have one mother and yet, the respect that I would like to receive and the respect that I would love my partner to receive as well never gets accounted for. 

and it’s so hard so hard for me to actually stand on business and confront my mother about even half of the shit that she does because it always gets dismissed and even when I come back to her we talk for a little five minutes and then all of a sudden the issue was fixed. 

me and my lovely partner are currently in a position where my mom had to take us in because college didn’t work out for the both of us, and before this move, there was a list of boundaries and concerns that I addressed as well as asking if rent money would be needed, but that was declined. so far she only was being nice and respectful for like the first two weeks we were here but after that, it seems like every day something new is popping up every day. every day there is something that is making her mad and she doesn’t even address my partner about it in person she addresses me about it.

I know that at the end of the day she is my mother and that i am living under her roof especially with my partner, but i am <mark>forced</mark> into a position at 19 where i cannot hold my tongue any longer and i don’t know how to finally address this shit without fear of retaliation, without fear of the bulldozer affect.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">So I work in my library at my Community College through a work study to make money to help pay for stuff, such as tuition, personal bills, food, etc., and so that I can have a place to actually study. I am 23 years old now and actually attended this school years ago when I was straight out of high school with it being essentially covered by a 2 year scholarship and was aiming to get a Chemistry Associate&#x27;s degree, immediately transferring that to a state university and continue on to get a Bachelor&#x27;s in Biochemistry. The big plan was to go to med school and become a neurosurgeon I thought working in a field that dealt would the nervous system, especially the brain, would not only be fascinating as all hell, but the money would be there as well, and that would also get my parents off my back. Funny enough, 18-20 year old me was an idiot and did not realize how much they REALLY made. It did not dawn upon me they easily net 350K+ a year; it was cool enough for me at the time and I knew it would make mom and pops proud, so I chose that path.

Throughout that go around at college, I did fairly decent, especially considering that as a kid with fairly strict parents who didn&#x27;t let me experience the world naturally, I went rebel mode. I was doing drugs, getting <mark>drunk</mark>, staying out late, partying, and learning how to talk to women without being scared (I played video games and talked to people online from the ages of 12-18 and thank the internet for letting me work on regular communication with people because I was always awkward talking to people around me, but funny enough I am now more scared to talk to people online because of growing up online LOL). I was also working throughout college to pay for things as well, because even though I lived with my parents, I never felt safe to trust them for any resources at all, which is very important. The semester I would have graduated, however, due to many things, I had a &quot;mid-college&quot; crisis and realized that a.) I love science so much but I hated the amount of studying I was doing and b.) I could not see myself in the med field, especially as a surgeon, because that would mean I would have to give up so much stuff that I had come to enjoy, such as hanging with friends, practically keeping relationships, and just being able to just &quot;chill&quot;.

So I dropped my classes. Never told my parents, and I, for the time being, focused on work and figuring out what the hell I was gonna do. My parents would never accept that I stopped going to school and had told me before that if I ever did, I would not be kicked out and not accepted by them. Sad to say, even if I was disowned by them, it would not matter much to me. We don&#x27;t have the worst relationship but my mom and dad have instilled a lot of trauma in me, such as not just only telling me my feelings don&#x27;t make sense and that I should not believe in my own emotions/feelings, but straight up DENOUNCING them, telling me that what I felt was just wrong, leading to a very warped view of myself. The thing that mattered though, is that I specifically did not want to get kicked out because I knew I had nowhere to go. And then in 2020, the pandemic hit.

I was fortunate enough to keep working at a crappy tool shop since we were &quot;deemed&quot; essential (us selling hoses was the only reason why we were still open because our distributor only were able to supply us consistently with hoses) and thus was still able to make money. To some I was lucky, but ohhhh nooo this is where stuff really went downhill for me. My hours were cut to about 10-12 hours a week because I was part time, and so I would literally make around $340 every 2 weeks, which survivable but I was paying rent in my house, my car, car insurance, etc. so I was pretty much netting 0 because I was getting just enough money to scrape by every month. I couldn&#x27;t get another job because of COVID and I couldn&#x27;t quit either because if I quit, I could not get the weekly unemployment benefits people were getting. I tried getting fired, but they literally would not let me go, which was so terrible. Fast forward, COVID had settled down halfway through the year, people got their jobs back, hours were slowly coming back, and by mid 2021, things started to get a little more back to normal.

Around that time, I was getting into photography as a hobby. I was intrigued by the fact that I could use that as an outlet to express myself, which is something I have trouble doing. So not only was I was working, on the side, I was learning, experimenting, and honing my skills with photography. My parents started questioning why I had not graduated yet and I had to lie to them and tell them that I needed two more classes; one in the fall, and one in the spring, to graduate because school was &quot;shut down&quot;, essentially buying myself a year&#x27;s worth of time to hopefully be in a better spot. In that span of time I actually started a side business doing portraits for people and honestly, I was getting decent at it. I was proud of something I wanted to do for myself, not influenced by my parents. By spring 2022, I knew I just needed a little more time to save up to move out, so I made up one last lie for one more extension of time: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t able to get the last class I needed.&quot; I had the summer to experience life, continue saving, and continue honing my craft. All seemed well, way too well in hindsight, until in winter 2022, I was fired for my job, for apparently &quot;going around the work place and shouting the n word with the hard r&quot; (to start, I am literally black, they had no proof that I said ANYTHING along those lines, and they lectured me about the slave trade??? Truly one of the most baffling things to ever happen to me.)

Not having a job, I knew that I had a decent amount of money saved up, but there was no way I would be able to sustain myself with just photography, so I needed to find another job so I could just do the move. For some reason, for the longest time, I was getting NO response. I applied to everywhere and was just not hearing anything back. Around this time, as all people with hobbies go through, I started to get my first REAL wave of burnout with photography because I felt like I had stagnated creatively. It didn&#x27;t help that my parents were stamping out my love for photography by forcing me to take literal thousands of pictures of random items around their house they wanted to sell, which just killed my drive.

2023 hit and damn was that not a good year for me. I was binge drinking because I had nothing better to do, I was vaping a LOT (a habit I picked up from my old job), and I was <mark>blow</mark>ing money because I convinced myself that I needed to cheer myself in some way, and was just doing wasteful stuff that I regret. I had friends but I felt as if I had no one to turn to not just about my financial situation (my parents are well off, but when I asked them for anything related to money, I am shamed because they have this idea that I should so much more than I do) but my emotional one. I was just suffering mentally and could not stop wallowing in my own sadness, so I decided finally that for my last LAST major lie, I told my parents that I was switching my major to accounting, and they absolutely grilled into me. If I was younger, they would have tried their best to threaten me with taking stuff away from me, but since I was paying my own stuff, they did what they do best and put me down mentally. And it hurt a lot knowing that even if I was truly still in school, pursuing SOMETHING, they would not be proud that I had the autonomy to critically think and make decisions for myself. Whatever though.

At the end of spring I was dead broke, but I was able to get a gig job through... Amazon Flex. At first I was happy to have a job, but I was quick to realize that it was a trap in disguise. If it is your only source of income, I guarantee that you stay stuck in the same position doing that. Gas is expensive as hell when you have to put gas in your take every other day (I have a 2014 Toyota Corolla, and I only GOT that because my mom crashed my 2005 Toyota Corolla, so I had to take out a loan to get that, putting me deeper in the hole.) In the summer I was readmitted to my school, filled out FASFA, and hoped that I could some type of Financial Aid, but got nothing. (my parents make PLENTY and even though they don&#x27;t claim me on taxes, school automatically counts me as dependent since I under their roof.) I talked to an advisor and they set me up with a job in my library where I could be a part-time librarian and study, which was perfect for me. As long as I just made something it was fine.

I was working at school when semester started and just when I thought I was going to start getting paid, and I can&#x27;t stress how tight I was for money, they told me that I wasn&#x27;t getting paid for another pay cycle. Essentially, I was not going to get paid for 5 weeks straight. I literally almost lost it. I was in credit card debt because of books and tuition, had a car loan I needed to take car of, and all of the previous stuff on my plate. I was in a worse spot than I was with COVID. And so, to make ends meet, I literally skipped an entire week of classes to drive multiple days for Amazon Flex at a time AND do the work study, and had to keep driving so much for the next two weeks that I was behind on my course work because I was either driving or <mark>sleeping</mark>. I did as much as I could but even while I was at work it was hard for me to focus in on studying.

Got back on track by myself, and even though I was always looking like crap every time I would even go by my parents in passing, (a regular day would have me out of the house from like 4-6am until 8-10pm) they just constantly doubled down on the fact that I should be doing more since I am older. I have never hated a statement more in my life. &quot;Get a REAL job.&quot; &quot;Oh, retail store x is hiring! You should work there full time and do school full time!&quot; Like geesh I&#x27;m doing my best.

Toward the end of that semester, a lot of stuff happened, most importantly, through a casual conversation with a friend who has ADHD, it was brought up that I MIGHT have ADHD. I didn&#x27;t believe him but was curious enough to test it and took a pre-screening offered from my school and the results came back that it was highly likely that I could have some form of ADHD, specifically the Inattentive classification. Was able to go to my family physician by tricking my dad into thinking I was only getting a physical (have not gotten one from my physician since I was 14) and they tested me and told me that I definitely was showing signs of ADHD and wondered why I was never checked out. I literally had no way to know because in my household, there is no such thing as mental health, you just have to &quot;be better&quot; and get past your problems. 

So I was prescribed Adderall and for like the first time ever my mind actually was able to untangle itself of the constant thoughts that were rummaging around in my head and stuff got clear. The small habits I despised doing became second nature to do once I decided to do them, my communication improved, it was a great feeling. What didn&#x27;t feel great is that once I started to be able to think clearer, I had slowly started to introspect more and realized that there was a huge possibility that I may be mentally messed up.

This occurred almost two weeks ago when, in the same situation as last semester, having to wait 5 weeks for a check, I had to pick up Amazon Flex again, and while I was driving without music (I usually jam out) I randomly wondered why I was so pessimistic towards life. My thought process protecting me in the past has always been something I echoed from my mom &quot;People are inherently selfish.&quot; Why did I think that besides what was imprinted onto me? And suddenly I had a &quot;eureka!&quot; moment. Most of the thoughts I believed were mine were just byproducts of my parents will. When I was told constantly that my feelings were simply wrong, I accepted that as reality. My own mind literally twisted itself into thinking that not just my opinions were not valid, but even my emotions were not as well. I had 0 agency in anything I did. It explained why after I graduated high school, I immediately and unconsciously put on a &quot;mask&quot;; one of someone who was constantly happy and jovial and amenable and for the past few years, I believed that that was the case. I had lapses of being what I thought were just sadness where I would isolate my day for extended periods of time, but I thought that was normal.

I have a stutter (that I have learned to mask), and always had attributed it to me not being able to communicate my messy mind, but realized that in my mind, to myself, I think that I speak so profoundly. I feel like [Chidi from the Good Place when he is not freaking out](https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/Chidi_Anagonye) , lol, but when it comes to conveying those thoughts, just by even trying to share them, my words start to lose value and I believe in them less and less until they scramble themselves up. I can literally remember a time when I was younger when I never had to worry about tripping over my words. I remember a time my sister and I had a discussion with my mom one Thanksgiving and told her we were scared of talking to her about our problems, and her response? &quot;Well that&#x27;s your problem. This is how I protected and asserted myself since I was younger. If I have to put the fear of God in you to keep you safe, then that is what I&#x27;ll do. At least we didn&#x27;t hit you.&quot; Even when I didn&#x27;t now how bad of a statement was at the time I even knew that was insane.

My passions are derived from wanting to please my parents. Practically everything I have ever done always had the intention of getting recognized by them. I hated sports in high school but did tennis and attempted track to try and fit in and get my dad to be proud of me. I&#x27;ve been playing volleyball since I was 19 and even though I have gotten humbly very decent at it, a part of me knows I wanted to pick it up because my dad played when he was younger. In elementary school, I was put into the &quot;prototype&quot; honors classes in 5th grade because my teachers deemed me gifted, but I didn&#x27;t care because school was boring, unintuitive, and focusing on things I did not care about literally pained me. I was kicked out and lambasted my mom because my teachers said I had &quot;so much potential, but was squandering it.&quot; I never got good grades but always was recommended by teachers to be put into harder classes because they could &quot;see I was gifted&quot;, which did not in the slightest matter to me. What did matter to me, was that fact that I realized that if I got better grades in harder classes, such as honors and AP, my mom alluded to the fact that she would be proud of me. I went from having all basic classes, to having 4 honor classes in 10th grades, to 5 AP classes and 4 honor classes in 11th, and then 6 AP classes and a senior writing tutor in 12th. The only happiness I got from that was not from being in these hard classes, but from the hope that my mom would be proud of me. Which didn&#x27;t happen because even though I understood the material, it&#x27;s not like my habits had changed at all, resulting in mediocre grades. 

All in all, I feel as if my sense of self is absolutely skewed. I feel as if I am not a person but just an empty void, here to bend to the will of the people around me. I have an inferiority complex, I have trouble trusting people, and I don&#x27;t have belief in myself. There are points where, when I thought about it, I&#x27;d truly not want to be dead, but certainly not alive, just to escape having to deal with these thoughts. It&#x27;s even funnier because I subscribe to the thought process of existentialism, specifically Camus&#x27; interpretation of rebellion against absurdity, but I feel like I cannot even do that. I am just enveloped in more and more of my depression, which is fitting, because of the thoughts I feel about myself.

 I cried for the first time two days ago when a friend of mine, after listening to me speak about why I felt like I was not creative, not intelligent, not valuable, simply told me that I was lying to myself and told me I ACTUALLY was what exactly what I said I wasn&#x27;t, and said that I am just a good person.  I don&#x27;t open up to people, and to people I am genuinely close with, such as 3 of my best friends and siblings, I am facetious because I feel as if my problems don&#x27;t matter no matter how bad I feel internally, I just know it collects. And all it took to make my dam fall down was someone telling me &quot;You are doing just fine.&quot; It felt so weirdly cathartic.

Cut to today. I learn early in the morning that my check for my work study, because I could not physically turn it in to my school last Friday because of snow, would be delayed another period ontop of this. So that&#x27;s not just 5 weeks of waiting for a paycheck, that turned into 7 this time. I went to my parents in desperation not for help with school or anything, I just needed help with gas. I knew I was going to have to grind yet again to even pay to live essentially and my parents told me to, yet again, &quot;get a real job&quot; and learn to &quot;sacrifice sometimes&quot; and to &quot;do more&quot; This semester, I am taking 6 classes, 5 of them being 7 week classes and splitting them between first and second halves of the semester, while having my work study, while doing Amazon Flex on the side. 

I wonder if I will ever be enough. I wonder if I&#x27;ll ever be able to find the power to do what makes me happy. There&#x27;s so much I have wanted to do and learn, like learn Spanish, learn the guitar, perform and write spoken word, learn how to play fighting games competitively, play volleyball better, workout more, but instead of being scared of failure, I can&#x27;t even start these things I USED TO ACTUALLY PRACTICE AND DO because I feel as if I am powerless to even begin because I don&#x27;t have the agency myself to do so. Maybe I don&#x27;t work enough though. And I have resentment for my parents, surprisingly. I appreciate them to death. My mom introduced me into pop culture through comics, building my interest up, letting my BLERDness blossom proudly. 

**But that&#x27;s the crux of my problem.**

**Working at my school has shown me I feel as if I have nothing to be proud of myself.**

**Being broke and feeling like my guardians I have in my life who should be making me feel safe and secure terrify me probably exacerbates the problems.** 

Thanks for reading my ramblings, my mind has just been firing stuff off today and I really needed to get that off. Off to the void you go, mr. thread you! (Sorry it is so long, haha)</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m beginning to develop a hatred for my parents. To reiterate, I am 19F, still living with my father.

I want to give a recent example so you understand my current emotional status. My birthday. I wake up at 6:15 AM. See a text from my father. (he wakes up around 5 to go to work 6:30. I am grateful for everything he does. He has long shifts. But this...) He sent me a picture of some roses and gave me a &quot;happy birthday&quot; text. First thought was &quot;oh wow. he must have woke up even earlier to go to our local supermarket and get a bouquet for me!&quot; (I recognized the aisle in the background.)

I got up to look around, no roses in sight. &quot;Oh well,&quot; said my brain, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care, he still went extra early to take a photo. I mean, it does kind of hurt that he didn&#x27;t even bother to buy a less than $10 bouquet when he makes $36/hour, an amount that would mean my birthday as a personal event is worth less than 20 minutes of his time, but it&#x27;s still appreciated.&quot; I spent some time with him before he went to work, and he was telling me some relatives down south are also saying happy birthday. I replied with thanks.

I went on the daily walks I have with my sister, and she happens to work at this supermarket. I tell her about the text, and she drops a bombshell. That that supermarket opens at 7. The night before he came back home at 9:45 PM, completely exhausted and going straight to bed. This is understandable, a farmer during seeding. But there is no possible way that he would have the time or energy to go to a supermarket and take a photo of flowers. Not to mention that roses are a bit strangely romantic for a birthday. And then it became clear.

He took that picture before seeding and sent it sometime in the past for his current girlfriend. What&#x27;s the alternative? Find a picture that somehow matches the aisle perfectly online? It&#x27;s the only thing that makes sense. I&#x27;ve gone to this supermarket my entire life, I know the layout like the back of my hand.

It was the barest effort imaginable. Plus, kind of uncomfortable. I wanted to cry but I fought it as my sister and I chatted. Once my sister and I got back home, I went to class before we went back to the park with my mother to have a bit of a chill time. My mom bought me those boxed chocolates, and I hugged her for it. My sister went the extra mile. She bought me macarons and the jewelry and mascara I would use for high school graduation. I made sure to hug her too.

Anyway, all this to say my mother suddenly began to direct conversation, like she usually does. Jumping from topic to topic, not giving me any breathing room and talking over me and my sister. And then she suddenly asked for my plans for the future, (I have shared this exact plan with her many times before.) Finally get my drivers license, get a job and get some student loans to go to art school and keep it, hopefully paying it off as much as possible at once I graduate. Get an apartment, save up for a good 15 -20 years and get a pretty good house. And then live my life chill. Maybe get a cat or two. No kids, but maybe a partner if life is good to me.

And then she replied over me, &quot;oh, finally, you&#x27;re starting to think seriously. My daughter not having a job is kind of embarrassing.&quot; I felt stunned and blankly stared at her for a few seconds before shaking it off and literally gaslighting myself into thinking that was &quot;constructive for my future.&quot; on the way back home, my sister told me &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry you had such a horrible 19th birthday. I saw you get quiet for a long time after mom said that. Not to mention dad.&quot; I don&#x27;t know where I would be without my sis. I actually cried a bit because of how well she knew me and felt for me.

This is just one example. Another one is that my sister has been suffering through a very painful disease for the past 6-7 months. Out of respect, I will not be specific. Shortly after the diagnosis, my mother made a post on Facebook, &quot;I just heard that my daughter has (insert illness here), this will prove to be a very difficult time for me. Pray for me and my family.&quot;

ME... and my family. First. Not my sister. Herself. Not to mention without my sister&#x27;s permission. Needless to say, I was infuriated, but kept my mouth shut.

Okay, speed round. My father makes so much money but somehow we&#x27;re living paycheck to paycheck. Not to mention that his boss bought his house for him, and he only has to pay the interest rate every month until he can pay the boss back, which is less than a typical one bedroom apartment in our area. He&#x27;s a very &quot;buy and do nothing with it,&quot; man, we have 2 cars and 2 motorcycles that he swears he will fix and/or sell, to quote, &quot;bring in the cash,&quot; but has had them for the past 5ish years and hasn&#x27;t done anything. His girlfriend also lives down south, so after around six months of dating and sticking to that schedule, he&#x27;s been flying back to this country.

He bought her a car and her son a laptop. I&#x27;m pretty sure don&#x27;t need to explain how 3 separate trips in a year and a half, a whole ass vehicle, and a laptop is expensive. We don&#x27;t even have the money now to get me new glasses, which I NEED to, you know, see.

Both of my parents are extremely narcissistic from my sisters unofficial diagnosis. She almost has a masters degree in psychology (only like 2 classes left). I literally trust her with my life, so you will hear many references to her while this post continues.

It feels good to finally say this somewhere.

My dad is cheating on his girlfriend with my mom, his ex wife. And for some reason, my mother let it continue for almost a year before she decided to stop and even recently sometimes she says that he&#x27;ll be at her doorstep at random times of the day and ask for sexual favours.

I repressed one time my father was upset that I couldn&#x27;t rake the leaves in the backyard when I was around 13, and he said &quot;I&#x27;m going to punch your face until your teeth fall off. Do it faster.&quot; the only reason I knew was apparently my mother heard him.

When my father and I went grocery shopping, (dis was back when the pandemic was still going strong, 2021-ish) he was incredibly rude to a customer service lady who was directing us to an open cashier. Saying something like, &quot;I am shocked that you are here, dictating where I should be going. I hope you get fired.&quot; I lagged behind him to discreetly apologize, just saying &quot;sorry.&quot; I hope she caught what I said because she was extremely sweet and that comment came out of pocket to the poor lady who was just doing her job. We had a <mark>blow</mark> up fight once we got the car, and I was shocked he would treat her that way, especially since he knows his own daughter works in customer service.

My dad follows a certain news channel that I will not mention, but based on the fact that he has this half-baked notion that customer service peeps will do anything to scam you/masks were useless/freedom is being suppressed/communism is on the horizon, you can probably infer the kind of influence he has. I was conversing with a brick wall, basically.

When we came back to the house, we were unloading our groceries and I kept pushing it because I got emotional like a dumbass and he threatened me again and told me, in Spanish, that the neighbors can hear me and if I keep being this loud about it he&#x27;ll slap me across the face. Keep in mind I was not crazy screaming, this was the same tone you have in a heated discussion. I called his bluff once we got inside and said if I really am the one in the wrong, slap me, because I will not admit defeat on this topic. Ultimately he didn&#x27;t but that just solidified my disgust with him and told me that I finally got him.

My sister went to the country where my extended family was for college for a good 4 years, from when I was about 10-14, and then going to the US of A for another school year before deciding to just finish the degree at a nearby university. Now that the context that I was alone during that \~5 year time period is set, I want to write about my troubles with my sexuality and horniness in general. This is where my mother hurt me the most.

Starting with my first exposure. I was 6, to the confirmation of my sister. I thought I was 8 for the longest time, but she specified I was 6 when my mom basically handed me a book about genitalia and sexual reproduction. I remember some pages so vividly, they weren&#x27;t pictures, it was more drawings.

As an example, there were two double spreads, I think the closest example I can give you is that monkey to human evolution picture. You know the one, showing that transition from a side angle. Well, this was like that, but they were naked, so you know. It would go from a tween to an adult and show body growth. It didn&#x27;t have any diagrams, but gave me the first description of PIV sex and specified the aspect of reproduction at the end. I never had your run of the mill stork story, basically.

Time skip, my parents were still married, previous context is applied, I was alone with my mom- OH YEAH- I forgot to mention I&#x27;ve been homeschooled since grade 1, just so you understand how isolated I felt.

Basically, my mom would constantly tell me about her relationship with my dad. Getting incredibly detailed and commenting on their sex life on the regular, saying his mini me was a bit too mini, if you catch my drift, or tell me how she often couldn&#x27;t... &quot;finish&quot; and she was left hanging, or told me about times where it wasn&#x27;t consensual, including my birth story, which was basically that my mother lost my older brother and she was so depressed from it that my father... Did it to her in her sleep to &quot;lift her spirits.&quot;

It made me incredibly uncomfortable but I didn&#x27;t say anything because I knew she had no one to turn to and she was deeply depressed. I definitely think that messed me up. She drowns me in affection sometimes and tells me that I&#x27;m the light of her life and stuff and I just think she&#x27;s deeply mentally ill because that&#x27;s just not normal or expected for a child born from non-consensual sex. (Sorry if that comes across as rude, but it&#x27;s generally a stereotype that&#x27;s expected. If I&#x27;m overstepping in my assumption, please correct me.)

What crushes me is that my mom and I had a discussion about this and she says that she feels like I abandoned her as soon as my sister left, and I tried explaining that whenever I would try to talk about my interests, you know, tween stuff, she would tell me that it was dumb and that she didn&#x27;t want to hear and go on to talk about their relationship. Sometimes even when I was having serious conversations.

I specifically remember one time where I was talking to her about some career options and she shut me down saying they were all stupid and proceed to talk about how lonely she felt with dad. After about 2 years of this I finally decided to try to stop interacting because I just couldn&#x27;t talk with her. I know she&#x27;s lying though, because she claims this was basically overnight and I distinctly remember the years it took for me to drift away from her.

This next things are going to be kind of graphic, okay?

Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.

Basically I was a horny teenager. Nothing new.

I had no sex toys, no lube, nothing to assist my raging libido. I started self-pleasuring when I was pretty young, some nights I would do it multiple times. I was also kind of an insomniac. At one specific moment, my mom caught me watching gay porn. Quick point to make is that of I preferred gay or lesbian porn compared to straight stuff but it didn&#x27;t come from a gross appropriation way; it was a horny unaware bisexual tween that was tired of straight people way XD.

She yelled at me in disgust, &quot;\[insert name here\]! That&#x27;s so disgusting! What is wrong with you?!&quot; after that she would basically do a random search above and below my bed and shame me for anything deemed gross, like underwear or something. This breaching of privacy diminished over time, but the horniness followed. Eventually was desperate for anything lol so I had to default to anything I could get my hands on. It went from a sharpie, to a hairbrush, to a... Large, blue flashlight.

Going off of my memory and a nearby ruler, the diameter was around 2 and a half inches and the length was around 12. It was big, cylindrical, and metallic, however, like 8 inches of the length (the grip) was comparable to very course sandpaper. I wasn&#x27;t that much of an idiot. I tried putting it in once, failed miserably, and it very much hurt, so I ditched the idea and used it another way.

Basically, she did another search and found the flashlight, confronting me and backing me into a corner, because how can you explain that? I was hoping I could trust my mom to keep that a secret when I told her, because, again, we were already talking about her sexual problems and I never approached dad about them.

I was expecting/hoping for the golden rule, but of course, as soon as he comes back from work, she tells on me. And my dad absolutely freaked out, basically yelling at me for 3 hours and calling me depraved among other words I will not repeat, and she did nothing. She just sat there in the background, interjecting with her own berating tone. She claims now that she thought that I was inserting it and could be causing damage, so she went to my dad in the hopes that he could &quot;set me straight.&quot; which apparently meant that she turned off her brain when I said it wouldn&#x27;t fit so I stopped.

In that same discussion we had, I specified that that event made me not trust her. I still stand by the fact that I took a chance in trusting her with that information and she knew how my father would react. It wasn&#x27;t her place to tell and she seriously caused problems with my sexual exploration. I had a strong case of religious guilt and I developed sneaky kid syndrome because of the both of them. Not to mention how long it took me to unpack my sexuality.

Grew up in a religious family, and you can guess by the fact that I have accepted my sexual identity, bisexual, for about a year now, that I didn&#x27;t have a good time growing up in the church I was in. I was consecrated within the first 6 months of my life, went to church every weekend, and went back home only to be met with my father&#x27;s favourite Spanish pastor who had 3 hour sermons that we would listen to for the entire day. I am not exaggerating in any sense. We would listen to like 3 different sermons. Our dad would just sit there on the couch or a chair and tell us to shut our mouths whenever we began talking. That pastor had such a distinctive tone and it gives me a weird mental response if I listen to him now. Whenever I talk about this with my sister I just attribute it to the war flashback memes LOL.

I&#x27;ve heard this is actually a very common story, but I was spanked as a young child if I acted up in church. Even if I so much as needed to walk around a bit from sitting for 2 hours, or whined when I was hungry. Apparently my sister was a one time &quot;offense&quot; and she never did anything again from the first spanking, but I was much more &quot;rebellious.&quot; I don&#x27;t remember being spanked, but my sister and mother have told me about it and I can conclude that he would drag me downstairs to where the male bathroom was and spank me.

Imagine physically abusing your child in a &quot;holy&quot; place and leaving them mentally scarred for the rest of their lives.

Couldn&#x27;t be me.

(By the way the most recent conversation with my mom brought up this topic and she had this demented look on her face. I don&#x27;t believe in anything right now but if there was any proof of demonic possession it would be my mothers face in that moment. She straight up had this grin when she talked about me being spanked, and when I said it wasn&#x27;t funny and described how traumatic spanking could have been for me (I&#x27;m not sure, again, I don&#x27;t remember, but spanking and trauma basically go hand in hand) she began crying and told me not to tell her anymore because &quot;it reminds me of the suffering I went through at the hands of your father.&quot;

It might have sound callous but I was stone cold when I told her that it&#x27;s in the past and there&#x27;s nothing that can be done now. I know that I might have stepped on a trigger but it seems quite insensitive to talk over someone like that right when they are opening up about their struggles. idk all I know is I would never do that to someone else no matter how much pain I was in. She straight up interrupted me (relayed that info to my sis and she just said &quot;self-pity crocodile tears,&quot; which I very much agree on).

Anyway, I kept going to church until I was around 15. Nearing the end of my regular attendance, I would feel so hot and stuffy at the end of regular church service, almost crying and feeling like I was seconds from hyperventilating sometimes. Sorry, but that was not &quot;God touching my soul,&quot; thank you very much, that was a visceral reaction from choosing to go into such a negative environment.

When I finally decided I wasn&#x27;t going anymore, my parents didn&#x27;t force me, but they did guilt trip me every two seconds. Especially my father, who would call me his church &quot;compañera&quot; which directly translates to female companion, because my mom and sister weren&#x27;t going either (just saying again, my mom also guilt tripped me but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as much). The people in that church were insufferable. He would consistently ask me for about a year if I was going to church with him once I dropped it.

Essentially church equalled hell to me and my sister. I can&#x27;t think of a single time when I felt welcomed or comfortable in that space.

I also think I was a child of neglect when I was young. One, because my sister spent the most time with me when I was a baby, my mother only caring for the necessities because of postpartum depression, according to my sis, the caring witness.

I was quite a silent baby after around 6 months, and my sister took the brunt work of keeping me entertained and taking care of emotional needs. Needless to say, my dad was also absent from my life, always at work.

My sister told me a story, that when I was a toddler (before I was talking), I would stare at her for an abnormal amount of time. To the point where I would get fussy for how long I was turning my head to look at her. One day, she turned me so I could look at her without having my head in that awkward position. My mother came inside the room and looked at the both of us for a few seconds before saying, to my sister&#x27;s face, &quot;You&#x27;re getting along so well with her. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t abort you.&quot;

Needless to say, this was scarring for her. She told me it&#x27;s okay to write this down, for reference. When she thought about it in retrospect, she realized that I stared at her like she was my mother. And my mom straight up says that my sister is making what she said up.

I was a wee lass, around 3.5 yrs old, and I woke up at like 4 am and managed to open the front door by myself, walking in -30C to my first daycare by myself in my very thin pajamas (for context the door of the old house had a lock that was only for someone outside coming in, so if you could turn the knob from the inside the door would open). My lips were blue by the time a worker saw me on the road, I was almost there. I am confident that if she hadn&#x27;t seen me, I would have died. She drove me back, to the shock of my entire family. Just for reference the daycare was about a block away, so it wasn&#x27;t that far, but think of my tiny footsteps and the temperature I was in. Yep.

A story told multiple times was that one time during the second daycare I went to, they didn&#x27;t let me change my clothes when I was wet. They also didn&#x27;t feed me whenever I misbehaved or talked out of line, you know, how children do. I hated going there, but I didn&#x27;t really have a choice since my mom was still trying to get a nursing degree, my dad was at work, and my sister was in middle school. I grew accustomed to the abuse and I theorize that that caused my unhealthy relationship with food (I have a bad habit of trying to eat faster and more than other people depending on their speed because I feel like I won&#x27;t get enough).

All this to say, with the amount of neglect stories that both of us have that have been completely repressed or forgotten, it&#x27;s safe to say that we didn&#x27;t have much parental support. Internet became my escapism in life after about 9 yrs old.

Forgot to mention that for a lot of my formative years, my sister would babysit me when both of my parents were at work, my mother and father having the nightshift and my father being gone the entire day, as well. I can confidently say that other than a roof over my head and food on my plate, my parents were never truly there for me. I would give credit to my sister for fulfilling that role. They always made it about themselves, or treated us like crap.

Something that still hurts to this day is that I have a lot of problems with my weight. I&#x27;m overweight. But something my father does is that he&#x27;ll call us by one describing feature, calling me gorda, which literally just means fat female. In an English context, it would be like calling someone fatso or fatty.

My sister? Flaca, means skinny female. On the opposite end of the spectrum, my sister was always thinner than me, but the same sentiment applies. When she was younger and her freckles were still visible, he would call her escupido de mate, which is difficult to explain. If you know mate the drink, you understand that it&#x27;s basically a loose-leaf tea through a straw with a filter. This basically means someone spit the contents of the mate on her face, hence, the freckles.

Whenever I confront him about this, he always tries to explain it away as &quot;cultural,&quot; and now, I&#x27;m all about respecting that, but there is a difference between calling someone a playful, cultural nickname and actively insulting someone, and sometimes, it just hurts. Like you were stabbed with a tiny knife to the intestines. We&#x27;ve told him many times to stop, but it&#x27;s just not getting through his head, or he just wants to hurt us.

And so.

I kind of forgotten about this draft LOL. I graduated 2 days ago as of writing this. It sounds harsh, but me and my sister decided to basically tell some white lies so that our parents were appeased on not being invited to the grad. My sister took a bunch of recordings and pictures so that they they at least had something, you know? Big moment of regret before was that there was going to be a school livestream and I sent my mother the link before I really thought about it.

They had a section where the students would give white flowers to the parents/guardians, and I emailed if I could give it to my sis. Principal said it was okay, but I realized that my mother might be triggered if she saw that or something. I really wanted to say thank you to any higher power that was supporting me because they were having technical issues with the livestream the day of and she basically saw only my moments from my sister&#x27;s recordings.

My sister has once again come in with another post from mom, &quot;Congratulations, my girl. Have a better life than mine,&quot; with some of the pictures my sister gave. Once again, about herself. It might sound small or nonexistent. But she always has to refer to herself. Why can&#x27;t she end the post on, &quot;congratulations, my girl?&quot; Or, &quot;Congratulations \[insert my name here\]!&quot; It always has to be about her.

Two &quot;new&quot; events. for context, my father is currently in home country but went on a previous trip about \~6 months before then. He got COVID from his then girlfriend (they have recently broken up. woo!) and felt symptoms for about a week, meanwhile he got me sick and I had COVID for almost a month. We went to the doctor twice, and the second time, he said to the doctors face, and I quote, &quot;I hope this medication helps because if my daughter doesn&#x27;t wake up tomorrow I will buy a gun and come to kill you.&quot; Yeah. Needless to say this death threat landed him a court case and more security cameras installed out and inside the clinic.

I berated him in the car, like full-on chastising, and he was silent the entire time. But after he drove by a few days later and saw the security cameras I realized that my dad was actually insane because he actually bragged about it. It pissed me off that after a long and very complicated story he didn&#x27;t even face ramifications for his actions, either. I know it sounds messed up, but I wanted him to land in prison for some time or even just get a spot on his criminal record, but alas, he walks off scot-free. I count this as a separate story, but it&#x27;s connected to this one.

We brought our mom up to speed on the situation right before the whole court thing went down, talking about how his &quot;work buddies&quot; were giving him tips on how to handle this. My dad told me and my sister that one specific coworker told him that he didn&#x27;t even need a lawyer. We just wanted our mom to know what was going on in our lives and voice on how we felt about our dad&#x27;s stupid and downright deplorable behaviour, but she ended up sending our dad a massive text telling him to not believe this coworker with very hostile language, and of course, because we were the only people he told this to, he confronted me.

This is when I fucked up because my first instinct was to lie and said I didn&#x27;t, but of course he didn&#x27;t believe me. So I apologized and took the brunt of the blame by buffering it and saying only I told my mom sparing my sis because she is in much more danger than me for getting kicked out, (her and her husband are also staying at my dads house because the rent they had on their house was too much and they want to save for their wedding (they are common-law) and move to another place in the country).

Of course, when I confront my mom over text she deflects and pins the blame on me for telling her in the first place when it was her choice to tell that information to dad or not. See, she isn&#x27;t as up-front as my dad, which is why we&#x27;ve compared her to a snake before XD. Always trying to find a way push blame onto anyone else.

So. I just scrolled up. And this is straight up the definition of trauma dumping XD.

Also recently, my mother began another phase of being an almond mom, (she&#x27;s fluctuated periodically throughout our lives) and she messaged me and my sister about a supplement series that will somehow cure my epilepsy and my sister her disease. She doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that both of these illnesses can&#x27;t be cured or helped with the types we have.

Again, I cannot speak for my sister, but at least from my perspective, I have none of the traditional causes for a seizure, like flashing lights or loud sounds. Every single seizure I&#x27;ve had is on the weekend. Both of my doctors attributed it to an emotional overload once I begin to process the week that has just transpired, and I definitely feel more jittery and strange during the weekend when I have that downtime. As well as when I have a strong emotional reaction.

You can understand why no amount of supplements are going to stop me from my seizures. And just to clarify, my sister&#x27;s illness cannot be helped by this either. Both of us found this deeply offensive and when my sister came back from work with some alcohol, I drank for the first time with my sister. (My countries legal drinking age is 19.)

It was ultimately a good time, my sister would constantly get house remixes on her fyp on TikTok for some strange reason, but we were still distraught by what she texted us. It was just a difficult moment for the both of us and we succumbed to alcohol to mitigate our feelings. We both agreed to never do it again.

Another time skip and I think I got a breakthrough with my mother. A few days ago my sister and I went to visit her and she began to tell us about how she was having doubts of the religion we had and we gave her a bunch of resources and an in-depth discussion on the topic, and she seemed receptive. We had a similar conversation today when I visited her alone.

I think she&#x27;s beginning to see.

However, I still think she&#x27;s a narcissist.

She basically called herself one. She texted me that I got a cheque from the government and that I should open a bank account to put it in. I told her about the bank I had in mind, and when I was leaving, she said &quot;you&#x27;re finally beginning to become a human being,&quot; and when I told her, naturally, that I was always human, she said, &quot;no, you were an extension of me, but now you&#x27;re becoming your own person.&quot; Of course, I just responded with &quot;Oh yes, because the point of being a human being is opening a bank account,&quot; just to end the conversation. But then she said, &quot;forgive your narcissistic mother,&quot; with a giggling tone while I was hugging her goodbye.

I definitely think she&#x27;s becoming a bit more tolerable, but she&#x27;ll have random bouts of disturbing language in a joking manner, such as homophobic, sexist, racist, etc. stereotypes that just make me so incredibly uncomfortable. It&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t know which mom you&#x27;re going to talk with some days. But like I said, at least she is willing to talk, unlike my father, who wouldn&#x27;t listen to another opinion for the life of him.

I&#x27;m not going to forget  that my father is deeply homophobic, racist, and sexist as well.

Anyway, I think I&#x27;ll leave the post here. I definitely have forgotten some things or left some stuff out, but I&#x27;m satisfied with what I&#x27;ve written. It&#x27;s just a massive rant about my parents and history. Idk if anyone will read this, but thank you if you did. It&#x27;s greatly appreciated.

            <div class="content collapsed"> Many might instinctively cringe at this opinion but hear me out. Let&#x27;s go through the actions of Cersei and see if the sum of her actions and personality can be characterized as evil. 

**Season** 1

\- Her influence on Jaime pushing Bran out of a tower. 

It is difficult to know whether she truly wanted Jaime to push Bran as she didn&#x27;t say so explicitly. But lets even assume she did want that, while the action is undoubtedly gruesome is it truly evil? if she wanted to push Bran it is not out of some ill intent towards him but because of self preservation for her and mote importantly her children, she knows that if Bran spreads her secret not only will she be killed, but all of heir children will be butchered by Robert Baratheon. Any mother in the same situation would have made the choice to save their own children if they had to. This does not make her evil. This is going to become a theme btw, Cersei does make gruesome decisions when <mark>forced</mark> into a corner with no way out. Though it can be argued that she isn&#x27;t even responsible for this one.

\- Showing sympathy to Catlyn

Number two is a good deed. After Bran falls she shows sympathy to Catlyn and tells her about losing her first child. Small deed but this absolutely important for her character.

\- Killing Sansa&#x27;s wolf (lady).

This undoubtedly looks like a cruel act, but if we try to remove our bias for cute puppies is it really?. First of all, she does it to correct the humility Joffrey suffered of being beaten by a girl and bitten by a wolf. Also, in the modern era we put down dogs who bite humans, which makes her action even more reasonable, and she doesn’t know whether Arya and the Wolf ambushed Joffrey or if Joffrey started the fight (which he did), as she wasn’t there. And she obviously believes her son before Arya. This reasonable justification is something I think differentiates her from the truly evil characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, they don’t need a justification for their actions. They are cruel for the sake of being cruel. And other characters like Tywin who I also consider evil have extremely flimsy excuses for their evil deeds, (Tywin is unnecessary cruel to Tyrion for his mother dying in childbirth, something he has no responsibility for. Tywin is extremely intelligent and knows deep down that Tyrion doesn’t have any responsibility which is why his continued cruelty is evil).

\- Having Robert killed.

If a friend you knew got physically abused, verbally abused, sexually abused, ignored and mocked for years would you think it was evil to kill the abuser? THE ANSWER IS NO, and that happened to Cersei. And furthermore, she once again only has Robert killed once she is <mark>forced</mark> into a corner where her children will be killed or hunted down for the rest of her life if she doesn’t as Ned is about to tell him her secret. 100% justified.

\- Being partly responsible for having Ned starks men killed in the Throne room. 

This is once again a fully justified action and it doesn’t just lie on her shoulders, Littlefinger and Janos Slynt both have some responsibility. Ned Stark is threatening to strip her and her children of all power, imprison them and to leave them at the mercy of Stannis Baratheon who would probably have them killed as they threaten his legitimacy if they should return to Tywin. Cersei gives Ned ample opportunity to swear loyalty to Joffrey and return to Winterfell, unharmed with all his men and both his daughters. This is an extremely generous offer considering he has already said he knows her secret. He rejects this and forces her hand; Ned stark is fully to blame for getting his men killed.

\- Trying to get Ned Stark to join the nights watch

This is a good deed, she is trying to avoid war and giving ned the opportunity to stay at the watch instead of rotting in a cell for the rest of his life. Once again, extremely generous.

\- Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from having Ned stark killed

Cersei does try to get Joffrey to stop the execution of Ned stark. Some ridiculously argue that she didn’t try hard enough. ZERO of the powerful people (Varys, Pycelle, etc) around Joffrey at the time manage to make him change his mind. This is a good deed as she is trying to avoid war once again.

**Season 2**

Now we have come to season 2. And in this season Cersei doesn’t do a single act that is even questionable. And no, being rude to Tyrion once after he joked about her incest isn’t evil. That’s verbal payback for being mocked. The same goes for being angry at him for basically kidnapping Myrcella. And while she imprisons Rose (because she believes Tyrion cares about her), she only does this to make sure Tyrion doesn’t hurt Joffrey, she immediately lets her go once Blackwater is finished and doesn’t torture her. So lets move on to good deeds.

Good deeds.

\- She gives Catlyn Ned starks bones back. Yes Tyrion suggests it, but she allows it (Which she has no reason to do if she is truly evil).

\- She gives Sansa advice and once again shows sympathy to her after her period. She recommends she has a child, so she gets some happiness in her life. Literally no other reason to suggest this other than being kind (and no she doesn’t care about Lannister legacy like Tywin does). 

\- She is clearly disturbed by Joffrey torturing prostitutes and being cruel to Sansa. Literally questioning whether Joffreys cruelness is a price for her incest. One of the most humane moments in the show.

\- She first lies to Sansa about Ser Ilynn being in Magors Holdfast to protect them as she doesn’t want Sansa to be scared. Only when she gets more <mark>drunk</mark> does she admit the truth (which obviously isn’t evil either).

\- She is about to kill Tommen when she thinks the battle is lost to spare him from the pain of Stannis killing her and him. 

SERIOUSLY TO DOUBTERS, LOOK AT ALL THESE GOOD DEEDS.

**Season 3.**

Cersei being Jealous of Margery

\- Yes Cersei is Jealous of Margaery, but she doesn’t say or do anything that is out of line before Margaery literally tries to manipulate her during Sansas wedding with the whole “lets be sisters”, Cersei realizes this and turns hostile as anybody would if they know they are being knowingly manipulated.

Cersei recommends Tyrion give Sansa a Child

\- Once again, a really good deed. No, she is not doing it to impress Tywin, it is made explicitly clear that she doesn’t care about his legacy in season 4. She does it because she wants Sansa to have some happiness in her life, an extremely good deed.

Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from verbally abusing Sansa at her wedding

\- Another good deed, she doesn’t like the unnecessary cruelty of Joffrey and tried to stop him from doing it.

Cersei is disturbed by Joffreys insistence of serving Rob Starks head to Sansa. 

\- Some would argue its just to attempt to control him, I totally disagree. If you watch the scence her smile evaporates once Joffrey shows his cruelty, and she looks disturbed and tries to talk him out of the idea.

**Season 4**

In this Season Cersei is a bit more questionable but nothing that rises to level of “evil”.

Cersei wants Pycelle to feed the leftovers of Joffreys weddings to the dogs.

\- This is just done out of Jealously, while it is certainly childish it isn’t evil.

Cersei wants to kill Tyrion

\- She truly believes he killed Joffrey, she is obviously wrong, but no parent is evil in my view for wanting their child’s killer dead. 

Cersei tells Tywin the truth about her incest.

\- This is a morally grey deed. Though I would say its mainly done out of love, she thinks he wants to steal and manipulate her son (which he basically does want).

**Season 5** 

Season 5 is more of the same.

Cersei imprisons Loras and is partly responsible for Margaerys imprisonment

\- Margery only has herself to blame, she mocks Cersei infront of an audience of girls. Insulting her drinking habbits, telling her about having sex with her son, rubbing in the fact that Cersei is no longer queen. And no this hostility isn’t just Cersei’s fault, Margaery started the hostility by attempting to manipulate her. And while it is once again childish of Cersei to imprison Loras, that’s really all it is. She just wanted some short term schadenfreude. She had no idea how powerful the faith militant would become and did not intend to start a war with the Tyrells. She is clearly ignorant in this situation, not evil.

Cersei rubs it in Margaerys face that she is in prison

\- Margaery did the same to her, enough said.

**Season 6**

Cersei kills a guy who flashes her in the lowest moment of her life. 

\- This guy literally sexually harasses her, and then continues to brag about it. She is the victim not him. Not evil.

Cersei <mark>blow</mark>s up the sept.

\- I am guessing this is moment some might believe, aha gotcha. But no. Cersei tries every other option before resorting to this extreme. She tries to simply stay in the red keep and put it all behind her, that’s not enough for the faith as they demand she is put on trial, she tries to solve that by having a trial by combat, the high sparrow then manipulates Tommen into absolving Trial by combat and sends Jaime away so he wont be there to protect her.

\- When she has no other way out, her life is on the line. The city is ruled by religious fanatics who brutalize anybody who dissent she finally <mark>blow</mark>s up the sept. She even saves her son who betrayed her. Also, if not for the faith militants stupidity Margaery and Loras might even have survived and another war could have been avoided. The absolute majority of the blame here is on the faith militant and the high sparrow who gave her no choice.

Cersei kills Pycelle

\- Pycelle is a disgusting man responsible for allowing Tywin Lannister to sack kings landing, he likes very young girls (though I am not saying he is interested in children), he manipulates Tommen and he stares at Cersei with a sexual smirk after she does her walk of atonement. Though killing him is cruel he is clearly a man who would betray her the first chance he got and also not a decent person. This act is cruel, I admit that. But one cruel act does not make one evil, especially considering the MANY good deeds she does.

**Season 7**

She mainly just rules as a monarch trying to defend her kingdom, defending yourself against an illegitimate and whiny invader like Daenerys is not evil in the slightest. Yes, she does kill the Sand snake (don’t remember her name) and the wife of Oberyn in a rather cruel way, however they literally killed her daughter just to start a war. Totally justified from Cersei. 

Cersei allows Olenna Tyrell a peacefull and painless death

\- Some of you might argue that since she even considered a cruel death for her enemy, she is evil. Absolutely not, it is precisely the fact that she is able to reconsider which makes her different from evil people like Joffrey who don’t. 

Cersei allows Jaime Lannister to leave her unharmed, even though he is betraying her by fighting with her enemies.

\- Once again, an extremely generous act considering what he is doing. Betraying her to fight for another house. And no it was absolutely justified by Cersei to not honour her pledge to fight against the white walkers. Daenerys (the spoiled brat) literally says she will invade her afterwards despite the help.

**Season 8**

Season 8 doesn’t count, and she spends her time staring out of windows and complaining about elephants. Season 8 sucks

In conclusion, while Cersei is certainly not good, and is perhaps one of the most flawed characters on the show she is still FAR from evil. She doesn’t enjoy cruelty to people who haven’t harmed her severely (like killing her child), she can often give good advice and show sympathy, she often tries to stop her son from being cruel, etc.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Dear dad, 

Remember the summer where your (now ex) girlfriend took us up to her family&#x27;s cabin? We brought the dog, our bags, and a bunch of food for the three days we were going to be there. I, at 13, was the oldest &quot;kid&quot; there, with the rest of the six or so other kids being at least four years younger than me. You and your girlfriend were having issues, and I could tell. You were always busy with work, on a call or something. When you weren&#x27;t on a call you and her were either locked up in your room (most likely fighting), or you were drinking with the other adults. And for those three days they drank perpetually. So did you. As the oldest person who wasn&#x27;t under the influence of alcohol, I often found myself in charge of the other kids. It was fun then, but in retrospect I realize that a lot of the time I was being placed with them just to make sure they didn&#x27;t get in trouble while their parents drank. And I get it, they were on vacation and needed the alone time. So were you. It could&#x27;ve been far worse, at least I wasn&#x27;t being outright <mark>forced</mark> to do anything, at least I could walk away. I cared for them, I made them lunch, I helped the adults when they were more clear headed, and overall, yeah, I had fun. But you could cut the tension between you and your girlfriend with a knife, and you just kept saying it was fine. But you weren&#x27;t fine and I could tell. I called you out on it one afternoon we were there. I can&#x27;t remember it clearly, I think I&#x27;ve blocked it out. But it didn&#x27;t go well and ended up with both of us storming off. 

These past months you fell into a bad emotional state. And I understand, these times are rough on everyone and you&#x27;re only human. The first couple times I was at your house I had a feeling something was wrong, but you didn&#x27;t tell me anything. You just vented about how you and your (current) gf were having issues. I was the one that tried to come up with solutions and trying to reach her on my phone when she wasn&#x27;t responding and we were both worried about her. I was the one taking the dog out. I made lunch for myself a few times. Eventually you did start seeing someone about your issues, but that didn&#x27;t necessarily resolve everything. If anything, you vented more. To be fair, so did I. We had some of the deepest, most meaningful conversations that we&#x27;ve ever had in my lifetime. But you still continued to fall apart. I could tell you were stressed, you weren&#x27;t eating properly and by extension sometimes I wasn&#x27;t either. The last time I came back from your house I still hadn&#x27;t eaten dinner because you forgot to make anything. But that falls on me, I&#x27;m old enough to make something for myself. Besides, you remembered just before we left the house, asked if I was hungry, to which I said no because stopping for food would have made us late. I couldn&#x27;t completely count on you, that&#x27;s nothing new, so it was up to me to be strong and take care of myself. Sorry I didn&#x27;t do such a great job at that. I felt how sad and stressed you were and I hate to admit it but I was worried sick. Looking at everything you&#x27;ve ever done, I want so badly to be able to completely hate you, but then there are times like this where I find myself caring about you. It feels idiotic and illogical and I loathe it. 

Well, now you and your new girlfriend are planning on going up to the mountains with your work friends. I&#x27;m coming and so is her kid, who is considerably younger than I. I&#x27;m 90% certain you and everyone else will drink the whole time. I don&#x27;t like to assume that, but knowing you, her, and your friends, you&#x27;ll probably take the opportunity to once again leave your responsibilities at home. So will she, and every other adult there, and by default her kid will become my responsibility. He&#x27;s not a bad kid, he really isn&#x27;t. And of course I&#x27;ll help watch him for a while and interact with him, but I refuse to be used as a substitute parent. It&#x27;s just that after the past months I&#x27;ve admittedly become sick of taking care of other people. I feel like a selfish, bad person, and I&#x27;m probably being over dramatic, but I&#x27;m sick of it. I&#x27;m sick of taking care of you while you go through all this all while keeping up your usual bullshit and antics. I&#x27;m sick of being the one that is caught in the middle of your relationship&#x27;s struggles, all with live commentary. I&#x27;m even sick of taking care of the dog, who I love to pieces, but is supposed to be *your* dog and *your* responsibility. And given the fact that once again relational tension is a factor in this, I feel as if history is bound to repeat itself. That once again I&#x27;ll be the one in the most clear mental state and have to take care of her kid. That once again you two will fight and it will <mark>blow</mark> up in everyone&#x27;s face while we&#x27;re stuck up there. There will most likely be no cell service, so quite possibly no way for me to call Mom to even talk, furthermore ask her to come get me. This time, though, I refuse to be stuck like that again. I refuse to just sit there, being helpless and too afraid to speak up while this all happens again. I&#x27;m older now. I have more of a say in the matter. If I start to notice a repeat of what happened last time, I&#x27;m removing myself from the equation. End of story. Like I said, he&#x27;s really not a bad kid, but he&#x27;s not my problem. As your family I&#x27;m here for you, but I can&#x27;t fix everything for you when I&#x27;ve come to realize that your issues aren&#x27;t necessarily my problem either. And that&#x27;s the mantra I intend to live by when we go up in a few weeks. Fight breaks out? Not my problem. Need me to be a babysitter not for a few hours max but the whole time? Not my problem. You not liking this attitude because it inconviences you? Not.My.Goddamn.Problem. I&#x27;ll be helpful. I&#x27;ll be polite. But that is all. 

So I guess if this is really going to be the case when we go, if you&#x27;ll need me I&#x27;ll be on a daylong nature hike, enjoying some damn peace and quiet.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">TL;DR: My boyfriend, Male - 18, of four months seems unprepared for a longterm relationship with me, trans Male - 18).

Our relationship started in a really complicated way, but it seems to only get more complicated as time goes on and now I&#x27;m at the point where every other person Ik tells me I should break up. Worst part is, I&#x27;ve wanted to for a while now. So four months and four days ago, me and my current bf got together a mid a serious falling out with a friend. We were and have been very close and I do really love him. My issue is that I&#x27;m questioning if he truly loves me or if he loves the idea of being with me. For context, when we got together I was in a deep depressive state because of the falling out as well as issues with another mutual friend whom I attempted to cut off several times and failed. We&#x27;ll call them Ky and the ex-friend May. Bf name will be Jake. So we&#x27;re all in one big friend group but due to two falling outs separately between me and Ky and me and May it got broken up into groups. Now, the closest person to me is Jake and so I make sure to put as much effort and love into him as possible because he needs constant reassurance and I don&#x27;t want another ruined relationship. I am a high fem trans guy and I&#x27;m not out to adults (I recently turned 18) especially my parents. In these last four months of my life, and being with him, I&#x27;ve realized so possibly serious issues in our relationship.


1) Jake is easily influenced by rumors. He takes what one person says and lets it nearly if not completely overtake his views on people, including me. This has become and issue several times where he ended up choosing to believe Ky over me and treated me a liar and someone who keeps secrets. The issue is that the rumors Ky told my bf were wildly exaggerated from the real situation and made me out to be a sexual harrasser and victim blamer. This I took serious offense to as even the &quot;victim&quot; said none of which was true. ( I was <mark>forced</mark> to apologize and clarify the situation with them even tho the issue happened in 6th grade and had been long resolved by 8th just to prove my honesty and innocence) What&#x27;s so hurtful about this isn&#x27;t even how vicious the rumor was but that fact the he so easily believed them and was willing to treat me like a pathological liar. That, and what brought this up was a veil of depression that lasted a few days to which he responded, as per usual, like he did something and I was keeping my feelings secret. Because of this he asked Ky about me and my &quot;habit of avoiding responsibility and confrontation&quot;.

I had already told him several times that he did nothing wrong and that I just have undiagnosed depression (he called this bull shit). Because of this situation, I damn near broke up with him then and there because I promised myself my relationships had to be built on trust but I had also promised myself I would put in the effort to make this relationship last. So my confliction lead me to simply tell him off. While he did apologize he said that he was just upset because, ofc, he completely assured himself that he did something and my being depressed was a punishment on him because no matter what he did to cheer me up I just stayed sad. He said he didn&#x27;t feel appreciated because I also never said thank you or acknowledged him trying to cheer me up. Keep in mind, I have strong thoughts of wanting to &quot;disappear&quot; and often shut down because of them. He knows this, and still he was mad I didn&#x27;t thank him for telling me to basically shut up when I opened up about this, because it&#x27;s too much for him. His idea of &quot;cheering me up&quot; is trying to guilt me into pretending everything is ok so he feels like a good bf rather than truly helping me. I often find myself keeping my feelings on certain issues to myself simply because I&#x27;m tired of hearing &quot;stop, dont say that, it makes you miserable to be around&quot; type shit.


2) I feel more like a burden than a partner. Our relationship feels like it&#x27;s more of a problem and inconvenience to him and his life and usually I just want to feel loved. He fail&#x27;s constantly to make any time for me unless we are already a public space together. He has no car or license and so he relies on his mom and friends for rides, fine, but his mom hates me. She thinks I manipulate him because she knows I&#x27;m weird and proud of it, and this was made worse when he outed me to her and then tried to downplay the situation. She goes out of her way to keep him from me, and for the longest time he tried to pretend that wasn&#x27;t true. And if he was able to meet with me to hang out or for a date, he forgets about it, its super short, or he cancels last minute because he sucks at planning anything.

I&#x27;ll be damned of I plan anything myself cuz him mom rejects all my ideas (half the time it&#x27;s the park, cuz we never go and we&#x27;re teenagers). His family is highly conservative, homophobic and transphobic. His mom specifically is the type to talk shit at home, foil plans, and be fake a shit in person. It&#x27;s highly off putting and I refuse to go back over his house because Ik the all don&#x27;t like me even tho only his mother knows I&#x27;m trans so far. His family constantly others him because he&#x27;s very different from them in his beliefs and two of them know he&#x27;s pansexual.
3) I hate myself and I&#x27;m worried that while at some point my love was unquestionable, now it&#x27;s only there as a place holder for the hate and low self worth I hold so deeply in myself. I am starting to see me being with him because I see him as the only one willing to put up with me. This makes me wonder if I&#x27;m just as bad for him as he might be for me. But I&#x27;m also not sure if Im <mark>blow</mark>ing everything out of proportion and looking for a way out because of trauma and trust issues.

At the very least I feel the amount of times I&#x27;ve wanted to end this relationship and had others tell me to as well is highly concerning. Would I be in the wrong if I break it off finally? Keep in mind he has been healing a lot from his past relationship because I pushed him to be more himself (another reason his mom thinks im a manipulator) and I think he holds on to me as a source of comfort for continuing to be himself. Lastly, I&#x27;ve recently fallen for another guy who seems rlly into me and a lot more understanding of my issues than Jake as we&#x27;ve been through similar issues and his response to my depression seems much more genuine than Jake&#x27;s, I feel like shit and obviously refuse to cheat but I know that this is probably another factor.


Edit: We broke up after he repeatedly proved to be getting worse and I showed strong irritation with it leading to me being pressured to admit I want to end things. This was over text and when he realized what I was going to do he asked to meet in person. i gave him his stuff and barely got to say anything before he admitted his faults and that he knew exactly why he was wrong, he then bought me food after we decided to just be friends.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for 5 years.

This was my first proper relationship, but she has had multiple relationships before me, the longest lasting 3 years.

I dont know if there&#x27;s a way to write this post in a non biased way without writing a whole book explaining our life stories.. nor do I know what the purpose of writing this even is, I guess I&#x27;m just trying to get some stuff off my chest during a rough time...

I like to think I&#x27;m emotionally mature, in reality I don&#x27;t think I could be labeled as that as I do have ADHD and a good amount of emotional dysregulation and anger issues. But I like to &#x27;think&#x27; I am or at least strive to be, because regardless of my issues I do know how a normal person should behave even if I struggle to behave like that, I always strive to be better and only do things with good intentions. I try not to make excuses for myself, I know when I do things that are wrong, I just sometimes don&#x27;t know how to do the right thing in a way that doesn&#x27;t come across as wrong.

Ever since me and my girlfriend met I&#x27;ve been telling her - lets be honest to each other, if there are any problems, you can tell me and we can talk about it, communication is key. I always believed all problems can be solved through talking.

But, even after 5 years it&#x27;s as if she never understood what any of that meant..

We started arguing quite a lot a few months after we started dating, mostly because of petty little things. She&#x27;d be dishonest about something, I&#x27;d find out she wasn&#x27;t honest and it&#x27;d set me off on a rant complaining about honesty for way too long. For example a common theme at the start was her talking to her ex she dated for 3 years. I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with that as long as it wasn&#x27;t cheating, and what she spoke to her ex about was certainly not cheating, her ex was in a commited relationship as well. I knew an emotionally mature person would say that&#x27;s fine and it was fine to me, I let her know it&#x27;s fine, but she&#x27;d still go and hide that she was talking to them and would lie saying she isn&#x27;t... Like why? I told you its okay multiple times, you don&#x27;t have to be dishonest about it, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen, we talk about it like adults and that&#x27;s it?

Most of our arguments she&#x27;d shut down as well and not say a single thing, it&#x27;d be like me complaining to a wall, she would never say she has any issues about me, nothing at all which set me on a tunnel visioned path of even more complaining and failing to comprehend how hard it could be to just talk. A lot of the time I&#x27;d say and beg &quot;if you could just talk to me we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess&quot;, sometimes even begging her to tell me something I did wrong and I&#x27;d want her to get upset at me for once so it wasnt so one sided, but that never happened.

I never wanted to be in those arguments, looking back yes it was toxic behaviour from both of us, especially me, and if we argued about such stupid stuff why were we even together?

We stayed together because the times that we didn&#x27;t argue which were the majority of the time everything felt perfect, so many times we said how great the other person is, it was everything we could&#x27;ve asked for. She was and still is the kindest person I know deep down. We had so many common interests, so many happy memories, so whilst the bad things were <mark>blow</mark>n out of proportion, in the end it was all mostly okay.

Things got better throughout the years, we&#x27;d still argue about some of the same issues but we seemed to argue less.

She struggled with mental health just like me, not diagnosed with anything, but she strongly believed she might have autism and was on a waiting list for diagnosis. She&#x27;s had a lot of trauma in her childhood from bullying at school and even at home because of an alcoholic step dad, she struggled to keep a job for longer than a few months and got diagnosed with some physical problems too like IIH migraines. I tried my best to support her, I researched what we could do to relieve her stress and migraines, how we could get a job for her that she would be happy in, etc.

I saw myself in her as I know how big of a struggle it is to achieve stuff in life when you have problems setting you back. I myself didn&#x27;t get a proper job until 3 years into the relationship. Then she finally got a job she has been in for about a year now too.

Things were starting to look good, we fought so hard throughout the years to live a better life together and we were finally starting to achieve that, we had money we could spend to go and do things, etc.

Except.. we still had our petty arguments and whilst they did get better for some time, they got worse again. It was exhausting for both of us, I was still mostly the same complaining about the same stuff, she was mostly the same shutting down and making me feel like I&#x27;m not being listened to.

Now this is the part which I regret the most that I&#x27;m very conflicted by and embarrassed of.. during some arguments things would get heated and I&#x27;d end up raising my voice and saying nasty things to get a reaction out of her because it was always so one sided.. I also did things to control her

I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m abusive, I don&#x27;t really understand my actions, I never wanted to be like this, I&#x27;ve questioned myself and read posts online to try and understand what the hell am I, but I just don&#x27;t know

For example something controlling and abusive I did was only a few weeks ago.. she had plans to go out with her work friends after work, which I truly didn&#x27;t have a problem with, I was happy for her to go out, she hasn&#x27;t been going out much and I always thought it would help us having some time away from each other.

I said to her okay, but please don&#x27;t get home too late and don&#x27;t drink much. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with alcohol and drugs in the past, nothing to do with the relationship, just personally it would make me feel terrible so I quit it altogether 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t been <mark>drunk</mark> since. Because of her physical problems and mental problems she has to take quite a few medications throughout the day and we always agreed she wouldn&#x27;t drink much because of it, in case the alcohol triggers any flare ups or interacts with her medication.

She agreed to this, but when the day came she left work at 6pm and only got home at 12am, I could immediately tell she was <mark>drunk</mark> so I asked her how much she drank. This time she was more honest with me (she was genuinely trying to improve in being honest, this wasnt just the alcohol making her more open) and said she had multiple vodkas, plus a few other drinks, as well as at least 6+ shots, or in her words &quot;so many I can&#x27;t remember, my friends were just handing them to me and I didnt refuse&quot;.

I don&#x27;t know if I was being unreasonable, but to me getting home around 12am is late and drinking that much alcohol is a lot... which is the opposite of what we agreed on.. now I regret what happened next because she was fine, the alcohol didn&#x27;t interact with her and she was okay even the next day, but I felt like she didn&#x27;t listen to something so simple again which set me off on another <mark>blow</mark>n out of proportion rant towards her

But this time it escalated and I blew up at her saying no more going out, she either doesn&#x27;t go out anymore as she is clearly irresponsible with alcohol or we can break up, I regretted saying it in the moment as I knew immediately that sort of shit is toxic, but in the moment my judgment was clouded by my anger and I just wanted the best for her. I was thinking &quot;but what if the alcohol did react poorly and you didnt listen to me?&quot; I didnt want anything bad happening to her... I felt like I was being disrespected

This wasn&#x27;t the first time I did something like this when I felt like I wasn&#x27;t being listened to. Another example would be her playing online games with her friends, which was fine, I&#x27;m a gamer myself, but a lot of the time I felt like gaming for her was a higher priority than our relationship.

Multiple times we argued about it and I tried to tell her how I felt, but things didn&#x27;t really change, which led to me <mark>blow</mark>ing up and telling her she can&#x27;t use the PS5 which I bought with my own money, I then went and deleted her account and games off of it as a punishment

None of this lasted very long though which is where I&#x27;m conflicted as to who I truly am and what my intentions are.. I never enjoyed doing any of this, I hated seeing her cry, immediately after this happened, every time I&#x27;d regret it. I&#x27;d try and remain stern though hoping it would bring a needed change to our relationship, maybe I&#x27;d finally be listened to.. I&#x27;d always give in in a few days as I couldn&#x27;t stand acting like that and things would go back to normal. I&#x27;d say things like &quot;PS5 I bought with my money&quot; but that was just to get a reaction, I never tried to control her money, she had her own bank and I had mine, if she needed money I&#x27;d give her it every time she asked, I never refused or took anything rightfully hers away from her

Even with the going out with her work friends thing a few weeks ago.. she told me she was invited to go out again this Thursday and whilst at first I reminded her what I said would happen, she said fine she won&#x27;t go out, within a few minutes I gave in and said &quot;okay I&#x27;m not being serious, you can go out, but please please just don&#x27;t drink too much&quot;.

She went out again, I had no problem with it, she got home a lot earlier and said she didn&#x27;t drink alcohol, I could tell she didn&#x27;t, but even if she was lying I believed her and said &quot;thank you, I&#x27;m glad you had a great day&quot;. That&#x27;s all I ever wanted.. there was no argument, no miscommunication, I was truly happy

I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m an abuser trying to justify my actions or if deep down I&#x27;m a good person that does things that come across the wrong way like I try to make myself believe..

Now I&#x27;m writing this because she acted like everything was fine, we woke up yesterday like we normally do, watched some funny videos, she had plans to go out to see her friend at 12pm and she would stay there overnight. Fine by me, I&#x27;m slightly ill and didn&#x27;t want to go out and we needed groceries so decided to order some before she left, she picked something she wanted, we watched more funny videos and as 12pm came round I hugged her, kissed her goodbye, did our little bye bye ritual, and she left..

Everything was fine, or so it seemed.. until I received a text about half an hour after she left saying she cannot do this anymore and is breaking up with me.. I tried talking to her but she said &quot;I&#x27;ll be back with my friends at 8pm to get some of my stuff and then I&#x27;ll be gone forever&quot; and blocked me. Now this sent me into a panic, this felt so unreal, I tried texting her family and friends to see if it was indeed real and to make sure nothing bad actually happened to her.. yes it was real

After talking to some of her friends she unblocked me and I tried talking to her, but she was just refusing it completely this time. She said we would talk in a few days.. 8pm came around, I packed some stuff she requested and put it outside her door for her to grab, she said she didnt want to see me so I respected it and stayed inside.. and now I&#x27;m here stuck in this situation

Normally during our arguments she only ever talks through text, if we are arguing in person she rarely ever says anything or voices any issues. This time she didn&#x27;t want to talk through text either.

I honestly don&#x27;t know how to feel. It&#x27;s clear she has been talking to her friends, instead of me about all our issues, she&#x27;s always screenshoted our arguments and &quot;aired the dirty laundry&quot; to her friends which I mentioned is a problem, but I never tried to control who she&#x27;s friends and most of the time we made up and tried to move on...

I don&#x27;t know if I have the right to feel hurt, my emotions are all over the place right now and this feels like betrayal. I feel like she has done a lot of things that were wrong, especially how she decided to end things by acting like everything is fine then leaving and breaking up over text instead of simply talking to me. I feel upset she would talk to her friends and let her know such personal details, but then again maybe it was justified because of my controlling actions.. even though she did a lot of these things way before I did anything controlling..

I feel like she is a good person but has painted a bad picture of me to her friends which has led her friends to influence her decisions based on a one sided story...

None of this makes much sense to me right now, I never tried to control her so I could have power over her, I never <mark>forced</mark> her to stay with me, regardless of all the things that happened between us I tried my best to improve and do things differently and see her for the good person she is. I made it clear if we ever break up I want to break up in a calm way, I just want to talk and communicate, I said how I believe most things don&#x27;t last forever and that it&#x27;s okay if things go wrong, but we need to at least try if we want to make this work..

I want to believe that everything I&#x27;ve done I did because I loved the person she is 90% of the time, I just wanted her to reciprocate and try to improve how she is during the other 10% as I&#x27;ve been trying to improve myself. I feel like I&#x27;ve sacrificed a lot for her but she hasn&#x27;t done much for me.. no one is perfect and I had good hopes for both of us.

And now the past 5 years feel like a waste. I don&#x27;t know why we couldnt avoid this mess.. mostly everything was great apart from our petty arguments

I now just wish I could go back in time and not argue, I wish I could&#x27;ve just let her be who she is and ignore all of those stupid little things because I was genuinely happy. I don&#x27;t want us to split apart without trying one last time.. I know I can&#x27;t force her and I don&#x27;t want to, it just hurts so much seeing the potential and have it be destroyed just like that.

She wants some space right now but said we can talk in a few days. I really don&#x27;t want us to split over this, I believe there is so much potential. How could I get her to see this? In the end I can&#x27;t change what she wants, but I don&#x27;t want to just say &quot;okay&quot; and be done with it without giving it a really really good proper attempt. I still love her more than anything else..

How could I stop thinking about her and calm down whilst I wait for her to talk to me and how could we improve things?

---
**TL;DR;**  :  girlfriend seems to have given up on our relationship without a proper attempt to salvage it in my eyes, how do I calm down whilst I wait for her to talk to me and how could we improve things?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Right now it’s not bugging me but I’m becoming unsure of my relationship and it’s future based off a few things:

Tldr: (in case you don’t want to read the full details) it’s our last year of hs and we’re not on the same page for living together and going to the Same college despite her saying she wants to and becoming emotional  when she goes on trips and I’m alone in our town she’s immature and irresponsible at times and that causes arguments and possibly influence the way her family acts around us,she says hurtful stuff and crosses the line at times, we barley do dates because she always fucks it up or don’t have the money,and communication is difficult because of how immature she is at times and it’s hard communicating with her when she goes on family trips and it’s causing resentment.

P.s: I’m not putting my eggs in one basket for her because of her actions even though I would like if we could live together nothing seems certain and I’m prepared for the worse at this point 

For starters this is our last year of high school and we’ve been dating since we were sophomores and this year we decide what college we want to attend and she said she didn’t want to attend a college in Chicago and part of the reason is because she wants to get far away from her parents but she also contradicts herself because when I asked her about where she would go off campus she mentioned going back to town “IF” she went out of state to stay  at her parents house until the campus allowed them to come back and idk how this situation will turn out for us but so far our college counselor mentioned schools that are in state and that’s for everyone and at the moment me and her can’t put the colleges she was talking about because of our gpa (I think ,I’ll update you guys)  and the problem is: if I can’t afford the college she mentioned If she could go I’m not 100% behind the decision of putting myself in debt while she has her parents to pay for her stuff if needed. And not only that but every time I mention college stuff or stuff mentioned in our senior seminar class she says she doesn’t want to talk about it because it upsets her and stress her out because she is afraid she won’t be able to attend her dream out of state college.

Additionally she has mentioned certain things that our hurtful and personal to me that I still haven’t forgotten even though each time she has said these things it’s either due to her period or a argument which I don’t think is a excuse because she does it to many times: she mentioned I have it easy because I don’t have 2 parents and that was crossing the line because although I moved passed not having my dad in my life that was a low <mark>blow</mark>, she also said when I found out I wasn’t able to put those colleges down at the moment and was devastated that I think we have to do everything together and we don’t and if I can’t go to the same college that’s not her fault (and she proceeded to insult me more instead of comforting me until later when I gave her the silent treatment for her actions)

And her mom always acts like she has to watch us (being present downstairs in her house because I can’t go in her room alone so we have to be downstairs or in the basement) and it’s really starting to annoy me because I’m almost an adult and it’s insulting and her parents treat her like a child and she complains about it and even complain about problems with her parents and yet she acts lovey dovey the next minute and she definitely acts immature and irresponsible both in the relationship and outside and I think that’s why her family treats her the way they do 

And lastly we don’t hardly do dates because she either never has the money or ruins it by not telling her parents and it results in them going somewhere thus forcing the date to be canceled and she has a jacket business going on atm so financially she shouldn’t have problems with her phone bill or anything but like I stated above she’s irresponsible and I have to pay for her phone bill when she doesn’t have the money  &amp;amp; I’m reaching the point where I don’t care about if we hang out or not anymore because I’ve tried and fixed my errors and she’s still being difficult with certain things</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">A little background: 

My (25 F) boyfriend (26 M) is Sikh. I guess I&#x27;d be considered as non-religious/agnostic. We live in the southern U.S. We’re also an interracial couple (I’m white, he’s Indian). There are a lot of traditional views on marriage/sex etc. in Sikhi, but we discussed before we began the relationship and he made it clear that he didn’t have a problem with sex before marriage within a serious relationship. Also probably relevant, but there has been some tension between me and his family over me being non-Sikh.

What happened:

So recently I moved in with him during quarantine. His oldest brother (31 M, he’s a strict, baptized Sikh and very traditional) found out about this and completely flipped out about the fact that we&#x27;re living together and having sex outside of marriage. He called my boyfriend (with me in the room) and told him that I’m making him act like this and that I’m a distraction and that I’m only with him for sex and his money. Basically saying I’m distracting him from his faith and that I’m the one who’s convincing him that it’s okay. My boyfriend did side with me and defend me but I felt really awful that he was being put in that position between me and his family.

His brother then called me afterwards (we have an okay relationship but we’re not that close at all) and he told me basically the same thing in a very lecturing/confrontational way and it was completely uncomfortable. Just saying he knows that I&#x27;m pushing this on him and basically that I&#x27;m a bad influence and pushing him in the wrong direction and implying that I&#x27;m coercing him into sex and thinking this is okay (as if my bf isn&#x27;t a 26 yr old grown man!) It was extremely awkward. I defended myself but I didn&#x27;t want to cause anything to <mark>blow</mark> up anymore than it was so I held back for the most part. 

But then to top it all of, he&#x27;s childishly threatening to tell their parents. So this has obviously caused a lot of tension and stress for my boyfriend and I hate that I&#x27;m causing all of this. He&#x27;s been apologizing to me because of how his brother is acting and is super embarrassed but he also loves and respects his brother a lot, so I know this is hard for him.

His brother also texted me this morning and told me to &quot;Think about what I said&quot; and I really don&#x27;t appreciate him talking to me like that but I&#x27;m also a very non-confrontational person and this is making me feel so awkward and uncomfortable. I also understand that religion is very important to him and I respect that and I&#x27;m actually open to converting to Sikhi, but I think he went too far when he started questioning my character and placing blame on me. Also I just feel he definitely could have handled it in a much more respectful way.

Right now everything&#x27;s really tense. My bf doesn&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s going to make this an even bigger deal and tell his parents or how they&#x27;d even react and he&#x27;s just super stressed that his brother is acting like this. And I really just don&#x27;t want to get in between them or stir up family drama, but I don&#x27;t know what to do and I really don&#x27;t want it to affect our relationship.

Tldr; My bf&#x27;s very traditional religious brother doesn&#x27;t think we should live together before marriage/have premarital sex because of their religion and says that I&#x27;m distracting his brother from the religion and that it&#x27;s all my fault he&#x27;s making these choices. He confronted me on the phone about it in a very confrontational and rude way. He&#x27;s also threatening to tell their super traditional parents that we&#x27;re living together. How can I deal with this or calm down the situation?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This will be a long post, I&#x27;m sorry, but writing it here gives some clarity to my heart and mind. 

I met him online. Tbh, I wasn&#x27;t attracted to him and very conflicted whether to continue on subsequent dates. He, on the other hand, did the chase. We clicked well, he takes care of me -until now, very caring, patient, and encouraging. My feeling grew. 6 months into it, I asked if we were actually dating (or only friends) and he confirmed we were.

Things went well until there&#x27;s change in his work, a month after we confirmed we&#x27;re dating. He&#x27;s under great stress and until now, 2 yrs later, needs to work on weekends and weekday until 12-1am. He needs a lot of personal space to recuperate, lost the &quot;me&quot; time to do things on his own (reading, etc). I give him space, but I didn&#x27;t say what I want and how we can work it out. We didn&#x27;t stay together, he lives with his parents and I live alone. We&#x27;re from conservative Asian family where his upbringing is stricter. 

I did feel I have unmet needs. There are red flags and urge from friends to ask clarification, but I didn&#x27;t have the courage. He met my friends and few members of family, but I know no one from his life. Yes, this is major red flag. It felt like a limbo, I could not seek out other option, but I didn&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re only a friend or a couple.  

I finally talked. As expected, he sees me as a special person with whom he can really open up as he didn&#x27;t have that level of trust even with his family. He observed his feeling and it doesn&#x27;t grow beyond a close friendship. He knew I&#x27;m moving closer but it felt wrong so he pulled back, but we still stay together so he thought I&#x27;m fine with it. Both of us know something is not healthy but we didn&#x27;t have the courage, fearing to lose each other.

We had very level headed talk. It&#x27;s 3 yrs worth of talk as we never brought up relationship topic. He sought out relationships but usually didn&#x27;t last long or going well as he&#x27;s not good in intercepting feelings. He has desire in the past but had gone off, perhaps influenced by circle of single friends. He doesn&#x27;t rule out marriage but content with his life now. His feeling to me is final, not influenced by stress. He encouraged me to move on and find the right relationship. I wished we can work out the right path from here, but he said it&#x27;s not of what I did or didn&#x27;t do, even if we brought it up early, it will end up the same. That is like a final <mark>blow</mark>. Yes he keeps my companionship knowing I want more, but I also have a share by choosing to stay than confronting.

There are plenty internal thoughts and questions, if the relationship doesn&#x27;t grow because feeling (which no one can force feeling to change) or because it&#x27;s not nurtured on that direction. He invested time and effort. We make times for each other in a week, talk for hours, we supported each other on low moments, he pick the best for me, he sent me to airport every time I travelled back home and pack gift for my parents. What&#x27;s missing is intimacy and fight, I&#x27;m curious if this is why the relationship doesn&#x27;t grow. We tolerate each other too well, that probably it sets the tone of a friendship than a couple. We did not communicate our needs well --on my side, I didn&#x27;t have the courage, on his side he doesn&#x27;t feel the need to. Is it because I become a doormat and he lost the chase?

I&#x27;m moving on now. I realized I wanted more in a relationship and I have positioned him as friend for quite sometimes. I still have a slight lingering hope/regret that something can be worked out, but I know he&#x27;s not feeling the same, hence not pursuing anything.

Tl;dr: I stay for 3 yrs with a man who cares and invested time/effort in me, but only sees me as a special friend and doesn&#x27;t have desire to work it out closer. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s something can be worked out but the door is closed, so I&#x27;m moving on.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Sorry if this is all over the place, I’m not good at organizing my thoughts. I’m basically just venting but I’m also looking for advice on what to do.

Anyways, so I’m currently a college student living with my parents. They’re stereotypical Asian parents, always expecting me to stay home and study to get straight A’s so I can get a medical career (which I’m currently doing anyway) and at the age of 19 I still have a curfew for 10:30PM. If I break it, they’ll <mark>blow</mark> up my phone and threaten to file a missing persons report for me lmfao and when I get home, they’ll yell at me for caring more about friends than family. I have never gone to a sleepover in my life and any new friend that I make they have to basically interrogate me about them to make sure they aren’t shady or anything. It sucks because they’re always comparing me to my cousins who are very introverted homebodies who stay home 24/7 and study whereas I like to have a social life and go out. I’m the first one in my family who has dyed their hair a “crazy” color, gotten a facial piercing, and has a (cosmetic) tattoo... all of which they yelled at me for lol. I guess because of that, they see me as a rebellious gangster or something and feel the need to crack down even harder on rules even though I am 100% the same person as I was before and I still am doing very well in school. I’m mentioning all of this just to give an idea of how different our mindsets are. 

So recently I’ve made the choice to join the Air Force, something completely unheard of in my family. Especially for a girl. When I told my parents, they completely lost their shit. They kept telling me it was a waste of time, I’m fucking up my life for doing so, and I don’t care about them or the rest of my family because they provide me with everything and yet I want to leave them. They told me I’m being selfish because I’ll make my grandparents worry about me along with everyone else and that the military is meant for people who are dumb and don’t have their shit figured out which is NOT true. But the thing is, I’m going in the Air Force reserves meaning that I’ll be living at home after the initial few months of training where I’ll be away. So I’ll basically be at home with them in the end anyway.

They keep trying to guilt trip me into changing my mind and they are CONVINCED I am only joining because of my friends (some of which are military but it’s unrelated to my reason for joining) which is just so close minded in my opinion. Joining the Air Force has been something I wanted to do for months but I’ve been afraid to talk to them because I know how they would react, but because I brought it up around the time one of my friends left for boot camp they think it’s all because of my friends’ influence. I think I’m old enough to be able to make my own decisions in what I want to do in life and it just sucks that they refuse to support me with my dreams. They basically gave me an ultimatum, which is family or Air Force... but why can’t I do both?

If my plans are not in line with what they want, they try persistently to change my mind to follow what they want me to do even when it comes to school. Originally, I had wanted to do nursing which they had suggested, but as time went on I realized this was not what I wanted to do. I switched majors to do health science for occupational therapy and they were PISSED. They were angry at me for changing my major because apparently I’m wasting more time by switching, and also because I wasn’t following what they wanted me to do. I was frustrated so I told them to stop trying to control me, and they denied it saying they weren’t and they never told me to do anything, but every time I do something that they don’t approve, they get extremely upset and cause a big argument over it. Yes, they aren’t explicitly telling me what to do... but whenever I want to choose a different path, they never support me and always try to change my mind to do what they want me to do.

I’m just so frustrated and I feel like they will never understand where I’m coming from. I just want their support, I’m not leaving them but they seem to think I don’t appreciate them which is wrong. I want to do things for myself, not because of my fucking friends. I want to join the Air Force to be a part of something bigger, not because I just want the money. I want to live my own life and start taking control of who I want to be, not have my parents live the life they wanted using me as a vessel. My mom told me just now that I’m the selfish one here for not wanting to stay with family and making them worry about me, but is she not being selfish too for preventing me from serving the country just because she wants me to stay at home, being the perfect little daughter? I don’t know anymore... if I give up this opportunity and let it pass me by, I don’t want to grow old and have the regret of not joining when I was younger. It would eat me up alive and I’d be so disappointed in myself. But like my mom said, my family would worry about me when I’m gone and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I guess I just want to know if what I’m doing is the right thing. It’s not like I’m joining a street gang or anything, I just want to serve the country but my parents are so against it. I’ve already told them that I wouldn’t be out fighting and would most likely be doing work inside of a building, but they’re convinced that I’m just wasting my time and I’m stupid for wanting to join. Instead, I should just stay at home and follow what they say because they provide for me so much. Otherwise, I’d be an ungrateful child and selfish for wanting to join and “leave the family”. Part of me just wants to tell them to fuck off and I can do what I want because I’m an adult now, but at the end of the day they ARE my parents and they do provide me with so much. I wouldn’t want to break off my relationship with them because I still do love and need them but I don’t know... I’m just lost and don’t know what to do or how to feel about this.

TL; DR: I’ve wanted to join the military for a long time but my parents are saying I’m selfish and ungrateful for wanting to do so. If I join, they said I’d be leaving my family behind and making them worry about me. Do I choose to follow my dreams? Or abandon it to put family first and regret not enlisting later on? How can I have them understand?</div>

I don&#x27;t know how to confront her about it or if the friendship has just run its course.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">So I made a friend a couple of years ago through my bf at the time. I knew them from hs, but I we weren&#x27;t exactly close, just part of the same group. Anyways, when bf (23M) and I got together, We&#x27;d hang the four of us (since he was always close to them) and it was always cool, except she talked to the guys kind of aggressively, but I figured that&#x27;s just how they got along. Let&#x27;s call the couple Boy(22M) and Girl (22F). So Girl and I start hitting it off and hanging one on one.

I hate judging people and I always give them the benefit of the doubt. But I noticed how everything was always about her in her stories. Like her childhood bff passed away and her main point she kept bringing up was how guilty she felt for not reaching out. Like, she&#x27;d say she missed her and how unfair it was for like a second, but she&#x27;d always bring it back to how bad and guilty she felt. Understandable, I&#x27;d say, i just didn&#x27;t like how she made it seem like it was about her.

Then, in the summer, I started having problems with my ex. We got in a car accident and when we got back home *I* had to comfort *her* because she was so mad at my ex for driving under the influence. I wanted a second to vent about how he confessed he had been cheating on me, but I was barely able to get it out because of how &quot;mad&quot; she was at my ex. 

Typically, she makes a huge deal out of birthdays and so do I. This year, she didn&#x27;t even ask if I wanted to do anything, and so I decided to ask her if she&#x27;d be busy and she just said &quot;sorry, yeah.&quot; And then she started switching it up. I was trying to figure it out, but she&#x27;d change things up and try gaslighting me. When I was done with dinner with my family, she was texting me saying they had been waiting at the theater for me even though I told her I didn&#x27;t want to go to the movies. We ended up meeting for drinks (me, Girl, and Boy) and she was crying the whole time, so I said we should just go after like half an hour of this. She told the waitress we would be splitting the bill. She had Boy texting me to figure out what was up (I know it was probably her) so I said I was disappointed  that she didn&#x27;t even apologize, she just kept saying it was a misunderstanding. So then she apologized, but it was through text and sounded so <mark>forced</mark>.

I just don&#x27;t like that whenever she&#x27;s feeling bad, i drop everything if even to just visit for a while. Once she told me she was feeling bad so I decided to take her a little snack. I was outside her house and I asked her to just come outside for the chips and she told me she wanted to be alone and for me to go back another time, but I saw Boy&#x27;s car parked outside.

All this while, I&#x27;m needing someone to be there for me because the person I had been with for two years left me for someone else. And she&#x27;d find a way to complain about her bf or about work or her parents- I&#x27;m talking small problems.

The latest issue was that she needed a ride to work. I crashed my car in September and have been borrowing my dad&#x27;s truck, but it&#x27;s old and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on maintenance on it already. I finally (reluctantly) decided to buy a car on Sunday. She needed a ride to work on Wednesday so I went to take her and on the way the car just gave out. I have no money to repair it and now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken car, no money, and my dad&#x27;s truck keeps killing the battery and I have no money to fix it. I call another friend to see if she can take Girl to work and she does, no hesitation. I ask girl to call her dad to see if he could tow me and she said I should call him. Like... ? I&#x27;m not comfortable enough to ask her parents for a favor, even though I knew they&#x27;d say yes. I would have called my dad if the situation was reversed.

And she cries sometimes because she&#x27;s legit abusive to Boy (she tells him off and criticizes him for everything) but she doesn&#x27;t change and it&#x27;s awkward to see her telling him off whenever we are hanging out. He just takes it. Last time I was over she got mad and threw her notebook on the ground and started yelling at Boy condescendingly and made Boy get up from his seat and give it back to her. 

I don&#x27;t even know anymore. I feel like she&#x27;s in this world where she needs to have a villain in her life. Or she needs to always be a victim, when in reality, she&#x27;s the one in the group that has the least amount of problems. (I was cheated on, I lost my means of transportation, I lost all my savings, Boy is stuck in a job he hates, but is also stuck paying for a car, the car&#x27;s brakes just gave out). And she just wants to have a negative view of everything. Even when she asks for advice, she&#x27;ll find a way to counter anything you say to her. 

I love her, i just hate the person she is becoming. I needed her emotionally, and she&#x27;d just <mark>blow</mark> me off if it was inconvenient for her. I just don&#x27;t know if I should talk to her and risk losing her? Or should I just ghost and see if she comes to her senses? 

TL;DR: I feel like my friend is selfish and at times abusive. I don&#x27;t know what to do about it.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Context before I get into things: I have always been a &quot;quality over quantity&quot; person when it comes to friends, and find it very hard to make new friends. So for the past 4 years or so, I&#x27;ve had more or less the same group of 4 friends. As time went on, however, two important things happened: one of them gradually started introducing one of his friends, a Swedish guy (the rest of us are all American) that he had known online since middle school, and another one of them I gradually developed a crush on. Her and I started dating, and we were both serious about trying to make it work even after we were living in separate states for college. Our friend group very regularly interacted over Discord and played games together and everything, and we remained close-knit after splitting after high school. Over time, the Swedish guy became more and more integrated into the group, to the point where he was a regular part of it, and at the same time things with my GF were getting a bit strained by distance and the worsening state of her depression.

She began talking to the Swedish guy very regularly, and it was because he had plenty of experience with dealing with depression and, and she felt comfortable talking to him about personal problems she had been dealing with for an ongoing period of time. This I was fine with, but I became more and more suspicious of something being up with them. She started showing more and more interest in things like drugs and alcohol, where she previously hadn&#x27;t much. Neither of us was really the partying type, but he was. In addition, I was really starting to encourage her to talk to a real professional about her depression instead of just a teenager on the internet, but it was slow going and she resisted it for a long time. On top of all of this, there was the added suspicion that she was closer to him than she let on, and although I was never too worried about it, I eventually had enough and asked if she could distance herself from him. I can be a controlling guy when it comes to people close to me, and I recognize it, but it seemed like he was becoming a worse and worse influence on her at a time she really needed positive influences.

Naturally, she resisted looking for a real therapist and lowering her contact with him, and so we talked about things. It eventually got to the point where I agreed to stop talking about the Swedish guy and give her some space, and I gave up on trying to fight her ever-increasing desire to try drugs. It seemed like a lot of things we had been talking about had been resolved and even though we had our fights, it seemed to me that our bond was stronger than ever and that even the toughest stuff we could get through.

The next weekend, though, after a 4-hour drive to her college, she broke up with me. It was because of the depression and the distance and my controlling nature, on top of all the other personal issues we had been going through. She didn&#x27;t tell me this until after two days of pretending everything was fine while I spent the weekend with her, which seems like a really heartless thing to do (&quot;how much else was fake?&quot;) but is beside the point. She insisted that she wanted to be friends, and that her relationship with the Swedish guy had been and will always be purely platonic.

It&#x27;s been about 2 months since then.

In the coming days and weeks, I had a lot of things to figure out. I was nearly certain that her and I were going to be together forever, since we had already made it past all the hardest parts of a long-distance relationship and resolved so many trials and tribulations. I had come to realize I don&#x27;t like engineering nearly as much as I thought I would, and my school honestly feels like hell with all the shit we have to do. The only thing that kept me going was the hope of a good future with her, but now that that&#x27;s gone I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m working towards. My grades dropped and if I don&#x27;t manage to keep things together, I&#x27;ll have to spend another semester before being able to declare any major I want.

On top of all this, my relationship with my friend group has been strained to crazy bounds recently. Basically, the Swedish guy has been becoming more and more of an asshole, and my ex is becoming more and more compliant, maybe even encouraging of it. I tried talking to him about things I was going through, because that always seemed to work for my ex, but it became apparent before too long that he was not the wise, non-judging confidant she believed him to be, and at one point he outwardly judged me so hard that another friend actually left the group for some time because she was so pissed about how poorly he had reacted to all of that. Other things like this have happened since then, where he&#x27;ll <mark>blow</mark> up, say shitty things to friends, and basically force at least one person to leave for some time. Still my ex, who continues to insist she wants to be friends with me (without actually doing anything to mend things), continues to talk to him about everything and anything. Genuinely out of concern for her, not jealousy or fear of them having a relationship, I (and possibly the other friend that left) had told her that our Swedish friend was incredibly judgmental, even though she didn&#x27;t think he was, but she ignores everything. On top of this, he&#x27;s been doing things like making jokes (mostly calling people offensive terms or making fun of the disabled) that she had always been very uncomfortable with, and she laughs at them now. If I could summarize it, it&#x27;s that he is becoming more and more toxic to be around, and actively messing up relationships around him, and all the while she grows closer to him and becomes more like him.

Although I know my relationship wasn&#x27;t long enough or at an age mature enough to warrant such an existential crisis, these friends have been basically all I&#x27;ve known for a quarter of my life, and definitely the most important part of my life. Just a couple days ago, I decided to basically stop talking to them and try to focus on finding friends here at my college, since other than that Discord server I don&#x27;t have anyone. I plan on picking things up with everyone but my ex and the Swedish guy after I find someone to talk to here, but it&#x27;s just hard in the meantime. There just seems to be so much toxicity and every time I think I&#x27;m over it I get dragged back into things. I want to look out for my friends and my ex but every time I try to do something, I get ignored, ridiculed, or dragged into even more toxicity, and I&#x27;m just getting so exhausted of it. I really genuinely love the others in the group, but they&#x27;re just so busy I can&#x27;t interact much with them anyway. I would hate to lose contact with them, but I feel like the current state of things just isn&#x27;t working, and at this point I&#x27;m pretty much done with my ex and the Swedish guy and am more focused on things with the rest of the friend group. If anyone has any advice, mostly for what I should to find new relationships, I could really use it.

TL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me months ago and I still don&#x27;t really know what to do or what I want, and I&#x27;m torn between wanting to help my friends and be there for them, and being too tired of it all and wanting to just drop it and burn those bridges. Relationships with my high school friend group have been strained and getting more toxic lately, but I don&#x27;t have any friends other than them and finding new ones is incredibly hard for me. I really just want to know where I can find some meaning without having to turn back to those toxic relationships. Advice?</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7myqcw/me_35m_with_my_sister_43f_who_disowned_me_via/" target="_blank" class="title">Me (35M) with my sister (43F), who disowned me via text message on Christmas Day.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">So, there’s some history here, obviously. Additionally, this is the third time she’s disowned me. I won’t go into all of it (because I’m fairly sure no one would read the novel I could write), but I’ll cover the basics.  

I’m the youngest of three siblings. My sister — we’ll call her Sue, is the oldest (43F), followed by my brother (40M) and me (35M). As far as I can tell, I’m basically the only person in Sue’s life who stands up to her, and she harbors massive resentment toward me because of this. She has a high-level executive-type job, and makes in the mid six-figures. This is important to the story because she often uses money or other material means to get people on her side. She also doesn’t seem to understand that other people have less money than her, which is odd because we grew up solidly lower-middle class. I’ll now present just a few of the greatest hits of the downward spiral in our relationship (each of which could probably be its own r/relationships post): 

**2009.** I am <mark>forced</mark> to un-RSVP from the wedding of two of my best friends because my sister (recently divorced) has set the date for her second wedding without conferring with any members of her family. I attempt to skip the wedding, but receive massive guilt from both my sister and my parents. For the record, this wedding was to the person Sue cheated on her first husband with. He was her boss at the time they started the relationship. 

Later that year, meeting my then girlfriend for the first time, Sue decides they’ll go out for pedicures. My girlfriend reports that all Sue did the entire time was bad-mouth and belittle my parents and our upbringing, all but flat-out calling my Mom stupid. This put my girlfriend (now wife) in an incredibly awkward position, as she was just getting to know my family. This is a prime example of how Sue attempts to ingratiate herself to people both buying them things and putting down others. I have an awkward conversation with Sue about this, and she denies having done it. 

**2010.** My girlfriend and I are taking a trip to visit Sue and her family during the winter. We are hit by a winter storm during the drive and have to pull over and stay in a hotel for one night to avoid dangerous driving. Sue gets pissed because she had activities planned for that evening/the next morning. She questions my decision to prioritize our safety, and insinuates that I’m acting selfishly. 

**2010.** Sue offers to buy airfare for me and my girlfriend to visit her for Thanksgiving. I say we’ll think about it. She goes ahead and buys the tickets, and then gets irate when my girlfriend can’t make the trip. We have a massive <mark>blow</mark>-up argument, and she forces my girlfriend (still new to the family) to pay her back for the cost of the plane ticket. I am, to this day, mortified that I didn’t do more to stop this from happening. 

**2011.** Our relationship has somewhat mended. I tell her I’m going to propose to my girlfriend, and she offers to take me to look at rings. She makes fun of me when I tell her my budget, and offers/tries to pressure me into taking a loan from her to buy a more expensive ring. I turn her down, and buy the ring I want to. She tells me she thinks I should have spent more, but that she’s glad I found something that worked. It works out (I’m now happily married!) 

Various things revolving around my wedding, including: complaining about required dress, food choices, nearly everything; forcing my groomsmen to pay over $100 each to buy me a fancy bottle of Scotch (which I don’t even enjoy, but her husband liked it); and sending me a grocery list so that I can have her hotel room stocked for her family when they get to town. I spend over $100 on groceries for her, and she never pays me back. 

**2013.** Sue lies to my parents by telling them she’s invited my wife and I to Thanksgiving, and even offered to pay for our travel, but that we’ve turned her down. There was never any such invitation, she just wanted sympathy from my parents (my wife and I were spending the holiday with her family). She apparently thought this wouldn’t get back to me. 

**2013.** Sue visits the city where I live for a work function. We coordinate meeting for dinner, and she brings a random co-worker who makes inappropriate jokes about welfare and people of color. Gets pissed when my wife and I correct her coworker. She has since been to town multiple other times, and every time I think we’re going to meet for lunch/dinner to hash out some personal issues, she brings a random coworker to avoid having a real conversation with me. 

**Later 2013.** Sue&#x27;s third child, a son is born. I am unable to afford travel/time off to go meet him, but do my best via FaceTime, etc. For reference, I live halfway across the country and my wife and I do not make a ton of money (public sector/ non-profit work). 

**2014.** After finally arranging some time off, I try to plan a visit to meet my nephew. I call and try to coordinate, but am met with a cold indifference. She literally says “We’re busy that weekend with a baseball tournament (for her older son), but maybe we could see you later in the afternoon.” I decide this is bullshit, and veto spending $1,500 to make a trip when she has such an unwelcoming attitude. 

**Later 2014.** We make a trip across the country to visit my wife’s family. This trip has been planned since before my nephew was born and occurs about a month after I tried to visit her. Upon landing and getting off the plane, I receive a text message from my sister accusing me of all kinds of terrible things, and disowning me. She blocks my phone number, and blocks my wife and I on all social media. Doesn’t care that this trip was planned far in advance, and was paid for by my wife’s family. 

**2015-2016.** We don’t talk much. My sister continually bad-mouths me to the rest of my family. We reconnect after my Mom has an episode (a stroke), and my family gathers together to get through it. We don’t have a warm relationship, but we exchange pleasantries at her children’s birthdays and at the holidays. I am not invited to visit or meet my nephew during this time, and do not feel welcome to do so based upon her attitude toward me. I continue to have normal relations with the rest of my family during this time period.

**Christmas 2016.** Sue visits my parents for Christmas (I had visited for Thanksgiving, but our holiday schedule dictated that this was a Christmas to spend with my wife’s family). Sue contacts me and asks me to come to my parent’s for Christmas, knowing that I’ve already made the trip out that year, and can’t afford another one. She schedules a “Family Portrait” as a gift for my Mom, and goes about getting a portrait of the whole family taken (minus me and my wife) to give to my Mom as a Christmas gift. My brother and his family are in the photo, as they live in the same town as my parents.

**Early 2017.** My wife’s brother has his first child, a daughter. We make the short drive to visit them and meet her. My sister apparently sees something about this on Facebook or Instagram, and so I receive a text message (with my Mom copied this time) from Sue telling me that I’m a monster, how selfish I am, and how neglectful I am of her and her family. A reminder: she makes on the order of ten times my salary, and takes no fewer than three vacations per year to places like Costa Rica, Disney, Hawaii. She has never attempted to bring her family to visit us. She disowns me for a second time and tells me I’m a “bad person” who she doesn’t want her children to know; that I should no longer contact them or send gifts. (Later that month is her middle child’s birthday. As directed, I do not call or send a gift. She calls my Mom and complains that I didn’t call or send a gift.)

**Mid 2017.** My Mom gets sick again. My sister and I find ourselves in the same hospital room, and we have some candid conversation. She knows I disagree with her about numerous things. I apologize for not meeting my nephew, and explain how I feel unwelcome, which she does not deny. She doesn’t invite me to visit, but we are now in contact again. We meet for lunch when she’s in town for business, and she brings her boss with her. I later find out she’s getting a second divorce, and is in a relationship with her boss. 

**Late 2017.** I have my first child, an awesome little dude. My sister and brother both reach out and attempt to schedule a visit to meet him. After about a month, I get back to them with some dates. They both agree - my sister even specifies that she won’t have the kids that weekend (they’ll be with their dad(s)) so it shouldn’t be a problem. I don’t feel entirely comfortable with her visiting, but feel that my brother will be a mediating influence. Five days before the visit, she cancels because she “has to coach her son’s youth basketball team.” This is obviously a big “fuck-you” to me. My brother still makes the trip and we have a great time. 

**Late late 2017.** Christmas day. I am visiting my wife’s family for Christmas. My son is too young to make the plane trip to visit my Mom for Christmas, but we FaceTime often, and have plans to visit in the spring. It’s hard, but I’m doing my best. My sister sends me a text message on Christmas day (during Christmas dinner at my in-law’s house) telling me that she knows I’m lying about not being able to travel with a young (not yet even immunized) child, and saying that I’m “killing” my Mom. Asks me how I’ll feel when my Mom dies before being able to meet my son. Tells me how I just pretend to be a good person, and that she “says what everyone else is thinking,” and is the only one with “the balls” to call me on my “bullshit.” We obviously get into a big argument. I respond that I don&#x27;t make decisions based upon her fucked-up sense of right and wrong, and that unless she can accept that I&#x27;m an independent person who is capable of making my own decisions, and allowed to disagree with her, she should just stop contacting me. She of course says not to contact her or her children, and that they &quot;don&#x27;t know who I am,&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t even miss” me. She disowns me for the third time. I later find out she was alone on Christmas day because her children were with their respective fathers (because she has cheated, again).  

For me, this is it. I can&#x27;t take it anymore. The feeling is mutual this time. I don’t want a relationship with her anymore, and I can&#x27;t even believe a person who is my blood could say things like that to me. 

I’m now torn, as I feel both a sense of relief about this, and also extreme stress. When my mom finds out that Sue and I are now officially estranged it will be devastating for her. But, I will not miss Sue. I know I&#x27;m a good person and I make the decisions that I think are right for me and my family. I love my family, and I visit my parents and brother when I can. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money, but I&#x27;m happy most of the time, and I do the best I can for the people I love. I don&#x27;t need someone in my life constantly attacking me just for living it how I decide, instead of how she thinks I should. I&#x27;m torn between trying (as usual) to be the bigger person and attempting to heal this wound with Sue for my Mom&#x27;s sake, and just giving myself the relief of letting her and her negativity go. I&#x27;ve been losing sleep over this, because I&#x27;m not sure how I’ll explain it to my Mom. She’s estranged from her siblings due to a family disagreement, and is terrified that the same thing will happen to us. She has previously expressed her sadness that Sue and I don&#x27;t have a good relationship, and I don&#x27;t know how to tell her this, especially with her being very sick. 

In short, this sucks. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with a situation like this? I feel like I’m lying every time I talk to my Mom and I don’t tell her what happened.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My sister sent me a horrible text message on Christmas day, resulting in an argument during which she “disowned” me. I am done caring about my relationship with her, but am having difficulty trying to figure out how to tell my Mom, who is estranged from her siblings and has put pressure on me to mend the relationship with my sister. To complicate things, my Mom has a degenerative illness that means she probably won’t be around for too much longer. How do I tell her about this?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This is very long, and maybe needlessly so, I’m not sure. I just have a lot of thoughts and I hope some of you might be able to help me out here. Sorry in advance if I get redundant.


I have a friend (we’ll call her Sarah) that I’ve had for 10 years now. I consider her my best friend, but lately I’ve been avoiding seeing her as she wears me out and I feel awful about it. I kept googling advice but it’s never specific and I always get the, “It’s Okay to Outgrow Friends and Move On” type articles. But what these articles never discuss is how this friend might only have YOU as their friend and are barely hanging on by a thread, and you dumping them as a friend would crush them. That’s what I need help with. 


My friend, we’ll call her Sarah for the sake of anonymity, has pretty much stayed the same person since she was in middle school. That’s a long time to know someone, and that’s a long time for a person not to change. She is constantly complaining about the same boy issues over and over. I give her advice, but she never listens to any of it even though she acknowledges I’m right. So, I have to constantly hear about her problems because she refuses to do anything about them. Only sometimes will she listen to me if she thinks it will benefit her to suit what she wants. 


Sarah is 25 and lives in another city near her school 5 hours away from where I live and her mom lives. She has ADHD, anxiety, and depression, but she doesn’t go see a counselor and doesn’t even take her meds regularly on schedule. She refuses to see a counselor, because she hasn’t had a good experience with one. I get that, but I had to go through counselor after counselor to find one that I felt like cared about me, and I told her she’ll probably have to do the same. It sucks, but she’ll find one eventually, but she refuses to even try. I have ADD, anxiety, and depression too, and I bust my ass trying to live happily, and I know it’s insensitive of me, but it’s beginning to really irritate me that she doesn’t even try. I know people experience mental illness differently, but when you constantly complain about the same things, but don’t do anything to fix them, it gets tiring and annoying to hear all of the time.


Her mom doesn’t necessarily help her out either. Her mother is a kind and smart woman and I love her like a second mother, but since the divorce, she’s been noticeably depressed, though she always tries to convince us she’s fine and happy. But all she does on her days when she’s off work is lie in bed and watch TV, surrounded by junk and stuff that needs to be put away. This is no exaggeration. She is always in bed when I come over and never wants to go out and do anything no matter how hard Sarah and I try to convince her. 


For as long as I’ve known Sarah too, her family on both sides, are mild hoarders. There’s always been an abundance of shit all piled up everywhere at her mom’s house (both her parents lived separately for work before they got divorced). On top of that, Sarah has an older brother who has Asperger’s and lives at home with her mom because she can’t afford this special housing for him to live in an apartment community where other people with special needs like him can live somewhat independently on their own. It just ended up not working out and Sarah’s dad refuses to help pay for it. 


Her mom is a very tired person, and she always looks so worn out by everything, so she never tries to force Sarah to do anything anymore. I remember how strict she used to be when we were in boarding school together and now she’s not at all. I know it’s because Sarah is an adult now who can make her own decisions, but not when she’s still living off of her mom. As her mother, she can still put Sarah on the right track and push her in the right direction. But I know her mom doesn’t try anymore because Sarah is so stubborn, you can’t make her do anything she doesn’t want to do. She’ll do stuff you tell her not to do because she’s the type of person who has to learn from experience.


Ever since Sarah’s dad cheated on her mom in high school and Sarah had found out and in the worst way possible (on her dad’s computer, finding dirty pictures of her dad and the other woman), they got divorced and she’s been kind of a mess and it’s only gone downhill. Her father somehow thought that her mother and him could still work it out, WHILE he was seeing the other woman. He didn’t see a problem with his cheating. He’s still with the other woman, I think, and he buys her kids presents and stuff, meanwhile, he forgets about his own kids from his first marriage. And apparently Sarah’s brother harbors a lot of contempt for his dad not only for cheating, but for never quite grasping how to handle a child with autism. So those are some issues that constantly follow Sarah around and you can see how something like this can affect a person. She was daddy’s little girl before the divorce.


But things only got worse when I was a sophomore in college and Sarah was starting her freshman year. She ended up partying a lot and gaining a ton of weight and getting really wasted all the time. And while this is pretty normal for freshmen, she did it on a whole other level. I remember her telling me she would go to class <mark>drunk</mark>. Take 8 shots before class and go. When she got burnt out on alcohol, she did ecstasy. Now I’m a firm believer of “everything in moderation” and that includes most recreational drugs, but she would use ecstasy to STAY AWAKE TO STUDY, and obviously that didn’t work out so great. It’s no surprise that she ended having to go to rehab before she even turned 21 and had to go on academic leave for mental health.


Her dad had gotten her a house the following academic year because everyone thought it would be best that she wasn’t living on campus where the partying was going on. That didn’t really work out though, because the partying then came to her house instead where they didn’t have to worry about getting caught underage drinking. An additional note: Sarah is part of Greek life, so sororities and fraternities and all that crazy college shit. She didn’t necessarily like having all the parties at her place, but she also can’t say no and gives into pressure easily. So, her friends aren’t really that great of an influence on her. Doesn’t help her at all being 25 and still hanging out with these people still. It affected her grades, but she’s never had the best grades. When we were in boarding school together, I recall never seeing her do her homework or studying and she failed so many classes that the school expelled her. That was in part because she has a learning disability and ADHD. But this continued well into college up until presently. And along with the rise of smartphones and all the parties, Sarah got even more distracted from her academic life, failing so many classes that she still hasn’t graduated yet. She was supposed to this summer, but she failed the one class she needed. But this year has been hard for her. She recently lost a friend who went to college with her who was shot and killed, and while taking the summer class, another old friend of hers was also shot and killed. On top of that, her friends with benefits relationship officially ended, and she was in love with the guy, so that really broke her down. 


Mostly, though, she has boy issues, and those issues kind of trump any other issue she has. Her dad might be an asshole, but what’s going on in her love life will always take over as the #1 stressor. 


Now, Sarah has been distrustful of relationships since her dad cheated on her mom. Even more so after she dated a verbally abusive, narcissistic, and possessive piece of shit that wouldn’t let her break up with him, even though he was a shit head who cheated on her multiple times. Basically, she gets cheated on a lot, or the guys lose interest and only want to fuck. Most of the time, she’s okay with the latter. For a while, she only had fuckbuddies, but she always seemed to want more. I could tell. She was always looking for someone better than the last guy, not just sex wise, but relationship wise, but she always says she doesn’t want a relationship. 


A couple years ago, Sarah was seeing this guy, and he ended up wanting a relationship, and she told him no. Those words scared her, so she pushed him away, and then he got a girlfriend, and she was so upset and mad about it, because she wanted to be with him, but not labeled as boyfriend and girlfriend, but still exclusive. So a relationship, in other words. And this seems to be the recurring theme for a while now.


I will say one thing, and I feel like the worst person for saying it, but out of all my friends Sarah is probably the least intelligent. She’s never been really bright and that’s one of the reasons why she always makes such shitty decisions and never listens to me. I have never really liked any of her boyfriends or fuckbuddies before and you bet I let her know, but she never listens to me, always joking, “One day I’ll listen to your advice.” UGH. And she might be the type of person who doesn’t listen to advice because she has to find things out for herself, but like, when does it end? When does she learn? She hasn’t yet. She keeps repeating the same mistakes and I have to continue to give her the same advice while watching her not take any of it and am <mark>forced</mark> to watch her crash and burn yet again.


I always tell her to never get her hopes up because if you really want a fuckbuddy relationship to work, you have to not harbor any romantic feelings for the other person and you can’t be clingy. Cuddling is a no-no, because it gives you warm fuzzies that are easily misinterpreted. You are literally just friends who happen to have sex, but without all the neediness of a romantic relationship. I tell her that if she is unable to follow through with those things, then she can’t have a fuckbuddy, sorry about it. She’s gonna get her hopes up and her heart broken yet again and I’m going to have to sit there and listen to it all again. 


Sarah’s most recent “relationship” wasn’t even really a relationship. She was fuckbuddies with this guy (who we’ll call Tom) because he didn’t want a relationship, but she had been seeing him on and off for two years. Turns out, Tom was talking to this other girl, one of Sarah’s friends, for those two years also and recently started officially dating her, breaking Sarah’s heart. But Tom had repeatedly told Sarah that he doesn’t feel the same way about her as she does him. That she should see other guys. He told her he was a bad match for her and that she could do better and that he was selfish, and you know what? He was right and he was being honest, but she still clung to every opportunity to be with him, thinking he was one of her best friends. And I guess in a way, he was.  


Was it wrong of him to continue to keep seeing her when he knew how she felt? Absolutely. He didn’t tell his now girlfriend about Sarah and he didn’t tell Sarah about his now girlfriend, so they were both in the dark. Was that stupid? You bet it was. Is it kinda dumb to date a guy who does that, I think so, but I’m not one to judge. 


But Sarah kept making excuses for them to hang out and have sex, so it’s her fault too, and Tom was thinking with his dick so he didn’t argue. When he broke it to her that they can’t see each other like that anymore, she was crushed. She was upset because he yet again told her he didn’t like her like that, and because now she had to stop <mark>sleeping</mark> with him and talking with him and where she lives, he was pretty much her only friend according to her. So now she complains that she has no one to talk to, even though she has other friends, like me, who have listened to her about everything. I feel like she’s just trying to make excuses so she can wallow in her sadness, and I know what that feels like, I do, but you can only wallow for so long. 


After the breakup, if you can call it that, I had Sarah over at my house with another friend of hers she invited over. Me and her other friend ended up trying to comfort her over the whole ordeal for the millionth time, and she proceeded to tell us that Tom was her best friend and now she has no one, which kind of hurts to hear, especially if you’re trying to comfort someone. I know she only says that because it drives her self pity party. But that same night she ended up Facebook messaging Tom’s girlfriend, who also happens to be one her friends, asking if she was allowed to be friends with Tom again and basically unloading all her life problems onto this poor girl. She told us since she can’t talk to Tom anymore, she’ll talk to his girlfriend as if she were Tom because she doesn’t know who else to talk to. Who the flying fuck does that? If you were really Tom and his girlfriend’s friend and wish them happiness, you wouldn’t unload all that bullshit onto them. You’d step back and let them get situated into their relationship first. I told her this.  She says to me, “It’s been long enough, they’ve had two years,” Yes, two years where it was unofficial and on and off, not a real relationship that everyone knows about. You know in the back of Tom’s gf’s mind, she would always be wondering if he’s going to go off and fuck Sarah if they continued to hang out, and that’s not a healthy way to start a relationship, but Tom is smart enough to realize that he can’t talk to Sarah for right now. But she doesn’t get it at all. 


She needs to give those two time together to get comfortable in their relationship. No one said that her and Tom couldn’t be friends after all this, because all she has to do is let those two get settled and get over Tom. But, it’s like she’s clinging to any hope of having him back. And I keep telling her this.  


Another irritating thing she did. That same day she had been feeling down and she made a post on Facebook that said, “Ya’ll I’m losing it, send good vibes” And then got mad when people started commenting on it and texting her asking if she was okay and if they could do anything to help or make her feel better. I remember her looking at her phone and going, “Ugh! I just asked for good vibes. I didn’t want people <mark>blow</mark>ing up my phone. It’s not like I’m gonna kill myself…” Completely un-self-aware and ungrateful. It just seemed like something a vapid teenage girl would do, not a grown 25 year old woman. 


She refuses to try online dating because she never met anyone right for her on there, but I told her it does take time and that she’ll have to weed through the pricks to get there, but she’s the type of person who if it doesn’t work out the first few times, give up on it completely. She is so certain she’s going to be single forever and she’s only 25 but refuses to try and date and hasn’t been trying at all with her appearance, and I get that she’s depressed and anxious, but if you complain about being single all the time, why don’t you try not to be single? And like, yeah, you will be single forever if you don’t actually try and she’s not at all, and there’s no way to get her to have this simple epiphany. I hate telling people that the only way anyone can love you is if you love yourself first because I think that’s bullshit, but in her case I think it bears some truth. Because she doesn’t put any effort into herself at all anymore, and she has so much potential and there’s so much there for someone to love. She’s worth way more than she thinks and she keeps trying to find self worth in all the wrong ways and all the wrong places, and it kills me to see her in pain.


Another issue is that she seems to still be in that college mindset of drinking a lot and going out and liking things that are pretty immature, at least in my opinion. She always wants to go to a bar, but I don’t really like going to bars. I’m 27, almost 28, so I feel like I’ve pretty much outgrown it. Bars are expensive and I like sitting at home and doing the same thing, but way cheaper and I don’t have to worry about how I’m getting home. I work now so my time is very precious to me and so is my money, and I don’t like throwing it away on expensive drinks. 


If we watch a movie or a tv show at my house, she HAS to find a drinking game to it. Even if I’m not playing. I can’t tell her to stop drinking so much and she insists that she doesn’t and is pretty much only doing it because she’s with me, and prefers me to drink with her so she’s not alone. I’ll admit I give in because we all like to get a little <mark>drunk</mark> sometimes, but I feel like every time we hang out, she wants to get <mark>drunk</mark> and I just want to chill out instead. And drinking games are for parties, anyway, not just two people. I hate feeding into her alcoholism even if she swears she hasn’t been drinking much, she’s still using it as a method to cope. 


I know she’s had some awful experiences and it really does feel like she’s gotten the short end of the stick handed to her a lot. I can’t imagine what it’s like to experience what she has, but at the same time, she also seems to set herself up for failure a lot because she doesn’t even try. She tends to just expect the worst, so why try? At one point in her life, after she finished rehab, she even lost all weight she had gained her freshman year and was fit and eating well, and seemed happier. But she quickly fell into old habits again, and recently gained all that weight back due to stress. 


I have ADD, anxiety, depression, and a learning disability just like Sarah, and I’d consider myself a fully functional pot head, but I still have a good job, a house, and a boyfriend. I’m in no way looking down on her because she doesn’t have those things because I know my circumstances are a lot different than hers, but I worked my ass off to be where I am now and maybe that’s why it’s so frustrating to see her not even try. I know she could have the same things if she just put the effort in. 


I do feel like I’m painting an awful picture of Sarah, though, because she really is a really sweet and sensitive girl. She loves with all her heart and cares so deeply for those close to her. She loves animals, and she has a dog and two kitties whom she loves more than anything. You know anyone who loves animals has a good heart.  I remember a few years ago, my cat got out of my apartment and was lost in the city. I texted Sarah and let her know what happened because I was so distressed and she dropped everything, and drove down five hours at 4 o’clock in the morning to help me hang up flyers for my cat the next day. I don’t know of any friend who would do that for me, other than my own boyfriend. That might give you some idea of what kind of person Sarah is. Very sweet and empathetic, but very troubled. She’s a beautiful girl, naturally very pretty. Always has guys hitting on her, so finding a guy wouldn’t be too hard for her if she tried. Yeah, she’s a little ditzy, but she’s got the biggest heart and she’s so passionate about her major. She’s so easy to talk to and get along with and so many people love her, I just wish she would see it. She has the most caring personality, the only person she doesn’t care about is herself and sucks. She tells me how I’m pretty much her best and only friend, and that if I ever died, she’d just kill herself. 


I don’t want to cut her off from my life, obviously, because if something were to happen to her, I would never forgive myself. She’s my best friend and I worry about her all the time. I know she’s depressed and lonely, but I know that she can better herself too, and in turn be okay again. But worrying about her all the time makes me stressed out and worried and brings me down and it’s hard to want to continue to deal with the same issues. I love her so much, but it’s so tiring try to take care of her. I just want her to be happy again.


So what do you think, Reddit? Got any advice? I don’t want her out of my life, but I don’t want to see her continually fail because she sets herself up for it already. What else can I do? What am I doing wrong?


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have an old best friend who has had a hard life, but refuses to follow my advice so I continually have to watch her crash and burn. It&#x27;s wearing me out. How do I deal with her not listening when she makes so many excuses and when her life is actually difficult?

            <div class="content collapsed">This is kind of a cluster fuck so bare with me.

So, recently my mother in law died. My father and mother in law were divorced, and my wife&#x27;s two adopted younger siblings live with their dad, my wife and I live(d) with her mom. My sister in law was pretty close with her mom, and came over and stayed weekends with us pretty often. A little while after my sister in law and her boyfriend got together, he started spending some weekends here as well, and they were allowed to sleep in the same room due to mom not really giving a fuck/not wanting to deal with the awkwardness of the conversation. I would consider SIL to be an &quot;at risk&quot; youth, who is rather scattered, emotional and not motivated towards anything in particular other than her boyfriend.

So, SIL&#x27;s boyfriend seems...older. Upon investigation his age listed on facebook would make him in his early 20&#x27;s. I pointed this out to  her dad at one point, and it was brushed off as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and he only had that age listed so he could get a facebook profile due to their age restrictions. It all gets brushed off and no parent actually asks to see his ID or proof of age. 

So fast forward to today. MIL is dead, and her son and I still live in her house and now own it. My SIL wants to come here and spend weekends with us, but her boyfriend usually spends weekends with her at her dad&#x27;s house, and wants to come along. We don&#x27;t like him. We don&#x27;t trust him. We don&#x27;t want to have to feel like we need to lock away our booze and valuables because he is here, and we especially don&#x27;t want to facilitate them having sex.

 But, I don&#x27;t want to push her away. She needs our influence now more than ever as her dad is generally dismissive and doesn&#x27;t give much of a fuck about parenting her at all. I want her to spend her weekends here without her boyfriend but weekends are the only time she sees him. If I push this age issue and more or less force her to break up with her boyfriend, she is going to <mark>blow</mark> up and never want to trust me again. Nearly every weekend now they are pushing me to let them both come stay here, and I don&#x27;t know what the fuck to say. I am running out of excuses and can&#x27;t avoid this forever.

What the hell should I do?

TL;DR
My SIL has a boyfriend who is way too old for her and they want to come spend weekends at my house. I want her here but I don&#x27;t want him here. How do I navigate this?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">The whole thing happened two days ago, but I&#x27;m still processing it and could really use some outside perspective since it&#x27;s a sensitive topic. ):
[Also sorry that this is technically a repost, I messed up the formatting the first time and deleted the original to put this up with readable formatting.]


Fiance and I have been together for 6 years and FMIL has always been a lingering trouble. He has four other siblings, but fiance is her favorite and she tends to hone in on him. My FMIL is bipolar, has clinical depression, PTSD, and a wide array of other conditions; she doesn&#x27;t work and lives off of disability. She&#x27;s always bothering my fiance to help her with various things (even though she lives an hour away from us and he works full time) including physical chores as well as asking for money and a draining amount of emotional support. She&#x27;s definitely been a burden on us and when we got together she started leaning on me as well. Everything is a drama with her.. About a month ago I decided to go low contact (she was <mark>blow</mark>ing up my phone every day saying she had emergencies and it turned out her dire emergencies would be things like, she was harassing her ex-husband&#x27;s new girlfriend and she called her a bad name) to see if I should return to full contact or try to go no contact. My thoughts with this were that I&#x27;ve never stood up to her before and I was going to see if she would respect our differences. Everyone tends to kind of treat her with kit gloves because of her conditions and the fact that she&#x27;s had a rough life.


This leads us to the incident. For the record, FMIL has never become aggressive with me before. I&#x27;ve seen her be aggressive with fiance, but never with me. Fiance decided he was going no contact with his dead-beat brother [24m]. They don&#x27;t really have any relationship as it is, but this was making it official. Lately because his brother will be getting married soon, some of his family was trying to get them to be closer by forcing interactions between them. Brother has always been awful to fiance, (examples include stealing and selling my fiance&#x27;s video games and clothes, using my fiance for rides under the pretense of needing help and then abandoning him for hours while he goofs off because brother doesn&#x27;t have a licence, and lying to a police offer pretending to be fiance and almost getting actual fiance arrested for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit, not to mention that brother is a blatant and proud bigot) and all fiance has ever wanted was an apology and he&#x27;s never gotten one.


So FMIL calls and she wants to have a family gathering of her kids because she&#x27;s having a foot surgery soon. Fiance was up front with her and told her that he&#x27;ll go to support her but he wants nothing to do with his brother. FMIL flipped out, I could hear them on the phone, she rotated every five minutes between crying and screaming at him before finally hanging up on him. Fiance was ok, this is kind of par for the course with her... and he&#x27;s been really confident in his decision to cut out his brother.


Cue the next day, I get a bunch of texts from FMIL saying she needs to talk to me alone without fiance present. I&#x27;m confused, but I set some time aside and call her. (My sister was also with me and heard the conversation.) She tells me at first nothing is wrong.. and then launches into a tirade about how she thinks that fiance is depressed and suicidal and she tells me a bunch of private details about her and her ex&#x27;s histories with depression and then asks me for a bunch of intimate details about my fiance. I said I wasn&#x27;t comfortable doing that and that if she wanted to know she should ask him. And then she says he won&#x27;t talk to her and I should tell her. She says he won&#x27;t listen to reason and he was crazy when she talked to him last night. When I refuse and say I heard the convo and I think he handled it well she says, &quot;Then why are you even with him?&quot; and goes on to say I shouldn&#x27;t be with him and I don&#x27;t deserve, in her words, &quot;MY SON&quot;, and that&#x27;s &quot;MY BABY&quot;. She then tells me, &quot;I&#x27;m the most important person in his life, I don&#x27;t care about YOU. I care about MY SON.&quot; I tell her she&#x27;s making me uncomfortable and needs to stop, but that ramps her up more. There&#x27;s some more babble about his mental health and then I called her on it and said that I thought this had nothing to do with fiance&#x27;s mental health, but the fact that he was cutting his brother out and she didn&#x27;t like it. I said I support my fiance and was proud of him for taking such a big step. I also reiterated that we were happy to meet with her about the surgery, just not with brother there. She berates me saying, &quot;You&#x27;re PROUD of him?!?! For tearing this family apart?!?!&quot; I tell her again that she&#x27;s making me uncomfortable. Then she brings up a very painful incident that happened several years ago between fiance and I as an example of how I could forgive fiance for that incident, so why couldn&#x27;t fiance forgive his brother. I dissociated at this point, I held the phone away from myself and just said, &quot;I&#x27;m not okay with the way you&#x27;re speaking to me and since you won&#x27;t stop, I&#x27;m going to hang up.&quot; And I did.


I called my fiance at work crying... He called her and she refused to speak to him. She sent me a text after that saying she was sorry, she was just worried for his health, and she loves us. We haven&#x27;t heard from her since. We talked with his dad, my family, each other, and I felt like we were really on the same page. What she did was unacceptable and no one is ok with it. He reassured me that he was on my side and would support me. I believe she was leading in with being concerned so that she could manipulate me into convincing fiance that cutting brother out was a bad idea. (She has done this before, a lot, she even admitted to it before and said I &quot;have a lot of influence over fiance&quot;, we just usually ignore it because it&#x27;s so ridiculous.)


I did a lot of thinking and I&#x27;m done with FMIL. After what she said.. even if it was in the heat of the moment, it has changed how I see her. If I look at her without the lens of sympathy I see an very ugly and abusive person. And I don&#x27;t want to be abused by her any longer. I brought it up again with my fiance last night and he seemed more indecisive than he had after it happened. I said I wanted to be no contact with her and he said that since she was his mom and would always be in our lives that it would cause problems for us as a couple down the road if I stayed the course. I told him I would support him, but I couldn&#x27;t do it for his mom any more and that this was just the last straw in a long line of incidents. He said ok, but I don&#x27;t know if he really agrees or understands. I know he is still on my side, but.. I dunno.. it seems a bit selfish to me that he doesn&#x27;t see this as horribly abusive and still wants to try to maintain some kind of a relationship with her. I&#x27;ve been angry before, but I&#x27;ve never told anyone I didn&#x27;t love them when I was angry.


What can I do? Everything in me and all of my loved ones are saying to stay the heck away from FMIL. I want to support my fiance and I don&#x27;t want to cause family problems, but I didn&#x27;t start this. I&#x27;ve always gone above and beyond for FMIL, I&#x27;ve been a support pillar for her and I thought we were on good terms. But it&#x27;s like a switch has clicked on now and I can&#x27;t go back. Am I overreacting? Is there another way I should be handling this?


TL;DR: Fiance decided to cut ties with his dead-beat brother, FMIL didn&#x27;t take it well and tried to manipulate me into changing his mind. When I refused and stood up for myself and my fiance, for the first time she unleashed on me and said a bunch of horrible things. I&#x27;m done with her and I want to go no contact, but my fiance worries this will ultimately cause a lot of problems and even though I know he&#x27;s on my side and he&#x27;s not ok with what she did, I&#x27;m not sure he supports me in this.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47h8vo/me_21f_with_my_so_22_m_of_four_years_refuses_to/" target="_blank" class="title">Me [21F] with my SO [22 M] of four years, refuses to cut ties with toxic family and is now putting a strain on our relationship.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Hi r/relationships, I am posting on a throwaway in order to stay anonymous. I can really use some advice in regards to my SO and the relationship he has with his immediate family, along with other issues between my SO and I. Let me begin by addressing the details of the issues with his family:

Having been with my SO for so long now, it has allowed me to get to know his family better. However, what I have learned about them is that they are nothing what they make themselves out to be. At first, they were nothing but kind, but as the years have passed, I have gotten to know their true personalities.

I will begin with the most toxic of family members, his mother. We will call her Shannon. Not only was she physically/verbally abusive to my SO growing up, but she is perhaps the most negative person I have ever met. Each time I see her, there is always something new to yell and complain about, whether it be about money, work, you name it. And despite all of her complaining, Shannon chooses to do nothing about her &quot;issues&quot; that seem to devastate her life on a daily basis. She manages to create such a negative environment around herself every day, and makes sure that anyone else in the general vicinity feels the same way. She is manipulative, a compulsive liar, throw tantrums over anything she sees fit, is never wrong about anything, and is the primary source of drama in my SO&#x27;s family. Nowadays, I can only be around her for so long before I have to leave my SO&#x27;s home. Her negativity, whining, and constant nagging has become almost unbearable for me at this point. 

There is so much more about Shannon that I can say, but I hope you get the general picture of her now. That being said, it does not get any better with my SO&#x27;s sibling.

I had befriended his sibling, Sara, back in high school prior to dating my SO. Once my SO and I began dating, we all seemed to get along very well. We had inside jokes, similar interests, and would have an overall pleasant time together, or so I thought.

After the first several months of dating, things started to go downhill, and have been ever since. My SO had to sit me down to tell me that the inside jokes I had with his sister needed to stop. When I asked him why, he said that she told him they were annoying and how I need to stop bringing them up. It had thrown me off so much as I sincerely enjoyed our jokes, and was absolutely convinced that the feeling was mutual as she never showed any sign of annoyance. This was the first of many events with Sara that made me realize she was not the person I thought she was.

Sara, as much as it pains me to say this, is slowly but surely becoming just like her mother in almost every aspect. She cannot go a day without complaining about whatever mediocre thing going on in her life, and will text my SO on a daily basis about whatever drama that so happened to find her. She always has to be right and is aggressively opinionated and close-minded when it comes to her interests. Oh, you don&#x27;t like said interest? That is not okay with her, and she will make sure to tell you how much of an idiot you are for not liking said interest. If you mention any interest of yours that she does not &quot;approve&quot; of, she will <mark>blow</mark> it off entirely and insist that hers are far more superior. She has lost many of her friends, but is always the victim in each scenario. It was them who did her wrong or turned against her. I have learned later that she constantly talks bad about other people when they are not around, and will compulsively lie to get her way. How does the saying go? If you keep smelling shit wherever you go, you may want to look under your shoe. 

Speaking of getting her way, if my SO ever made her mad, Sara would make up scenarios out of nowhere and tell me things that she knew would make me mad at my SO. We have had countless arguments throughout the years because of her lies. My SO and I know better these days, but Sara has settled with asking us questions that she knows will get myself or my SO upset, thus sparking an argument between us. She has also insisted in the past that I can trust her with any relationship advice. However, she makes sure that, not only my SO knows everything I told her, but that she will exaggerate or make up certain points to my SO. And guess what? More arguments would ensue. 

All my trust in Sara is now completely gone, and I am always weary of spending time with her. Over time, I have now come to the realization that it would be in my best interest, for the sake of my mental health, to avoid people like her and Shannon. 

After four years of being with my SO, I have now realized that Shannon and Sara&#x27;s behavior is only getting worse. Their consistent negativity has honestly had me at a breaking point these days. I have severe anxiety whenever I am around them, my self esteem is at an all-time low, and I can&#x27;t seem to confide in others the way I used to. They have managed to shatter whatever good I could try to find in others, and they always bring me down with their negative attitudes towards life. I literally feel like an empty shell of my former self. 

Before dating my SO, I was almost an entirely different person than who I am today. I was always viewing life with a positive outlook, had many friends, ran six days a week, and always had something to smile about. Nowadays, I can&#x27;t even bring myself to keep eye contact with a stranger, in fear of what they may be thinking of me. I have lost contact with a good amount of my friends as my SO did not &quot;approve&quot; of them, I no longer have a positive mentality, and have given up on exercising. My SO hates running, and despite him insisting we should start running, he lacks the discipline and would rather stay home and play video games.

Now, here is where it gets worse. Since my SO would prefer to stay home, and constantly wants me to spend time with him, I am <mark>forced</mark> to be around Shannon and Sara on almost a daily basis. This has now been the case for the past three years. It is both frustrating and sad to me as I type this because the negative environment they create is overwhelming, and I have had enough of it. 

It does not help that I now realize that my SO has literally made me his whole life. He works with me, has picked the same major as me, gained quite a bit of weight, has no hobbies and doesn&#x27;t seem interested in rekindling his old friendships. I encourage him to find a hobby he likes or hang out with his friends, but in the end he refuses to do so.

Having the same major does not help either, as we also take the same classes together and have been since we started college. He will flirt with other female classmates, then later insist that he was only being friendly. But that&#x27;s not even the worst part; The worst part is that, literally every semester, he has to tell his life story about how awful his family is and how devastating his childhood was to every person we befriend in our classes. Yes, he has every reason to be upset, but he literally makes it a point to let as many people know about his family&#x27;s toxicity and his life story. I&#x27;ve had to listen to the same stories over and over again, and get to see new people feel sorry for him. It almost makes me livid thinking that he thinks it&#x27;s okay to practically victimize himself in front of people he just met. I have never been comfortable with the idea about my SO being so open about such sensitive details, since he makes sure to let people know practically every detail. 

Now my SO and I have had several long discussions in the past few months about his family and my feelings towards them. I let him know everything I feel about them and how I would prefer it if I wouldn&#x27;t have to be around them. During these discussions, my SO insists that he understands and doesn&#x27;t blame me for feeling the way that I do. He tells me if he could, he would never speak to his family again... but that he can&#x27;t?
 
And why is that, you may ask? My SO was raised and is absolutely firm on the motto that family comes first. 

Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I understand and agree with the family comes first mentality, but I can&#x27;t seem to stress enough to my SO that his toxic family should be the exception, especially now that it is affecting me this badly. It truly hurts me that he says he cannot get rid of them because they are his family, and he will always be there for them as there are rare times when they are good. By telling me this, I already feel as though he is putting his family before me and my own well being... And despite him saying that we will see his family less for my sake, he is always inviting Sara to hang out with us. He will also get upset when I tell him I&#x27;ll be heading home soon because I know his mom will be home shortly. I can&#x27;t tell you the amount of times I&#x27;ve stayed with him, despite his family being there and just &quot;dealing with&quot; my anxiety, because I know how upset he gets when I decide to go home. 

It doesn&#x27;t help that my SO plans on moving in with Sara and her friends in the upcoming months, as Shannon is basically kicking them out. She claims she can no longer afford their home and cannot continue to pay for their expenses. Now my SO is set on moving in with Sara and wants me to move in with him so that we can be together all the time. (As if we aren&#x27;t together all the time as it is). Since I don&#x27;t want to move in with him and Sara, he still insists that I go spend time with him at their new home on a daily basis.

Throughout our years together, there has been talk of my SO and I eventually getting married. And honestly, even the thought of it absolutely terrifies me these days. Just the idea of being related to his family, having to invite them to our wedding where their drama would ensue, being <mark>forced</mark> to go to every family gathering where they will be present, having them show up at my home whenever they want, and eventually them being around and influencing their toxicity on our children? I&#x27;m sorry, but this is where I feel I must draw the line. If I have so many issues with being around his family now, I&#x27;ll be damned if my own offspring have to experience those same issues for themselves.

Now I guess I will end this all with a question I&#x27;ve had for a long time: is this relationship even worth it anymore? What should I do? Since we work together, have classes together, and even purchased a car together back in October, I feel as though I am stuck in this relationship... 

Please, any advice is greatly appreciated.


tl;dr: SO refuses to end relationship with his family despite their toxicity. SO always wants to be home and always wants me with him. I am <mark>forced</mark> to be around the negative environment his family creates every day and now suffer severe anxiety whenever I am around them. Beginning to resent my SO for his &quot;family first&quot; mentality and starting to wonder if relationship is worth my mental sanity...</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">So, I met a girl online (dating app) mid December last year, so not long ago, though it feels like a very long time indeed. In short, we have an incredible connection but she seems unwilling to let herself get more involved with me that just &#x27;fun&#x27;. I may be projecting, but I believe she&#x27;s letting her last awful relationship influence her idea of what a good one would be, and refuses to let herself be vulnerable despite how different I am to her ex. 

&amp;nbsp;

About me - It might help to know, I&#x27;ve never done the &#x27;Dating&#x27; thing. I&#x27;ve always just met a girl and it turned into a relationship, or had a brief sexual encounter. I&#x27;ve never slept with more than one person at a time before.

&amp;nbsp;

I&#x27;ll try and give you the full story without boring you to death:

&amp;nbsp;


From the first date I felt a very strong connection and it seemed we hit it off immensely well, immediately arranging to see each other again within a couple of days. 

&amp;nbsp;


She had just started a new job, which seems very demanding, so it was a little difficult to see her again, but just after Christmas we met and slept together, which, in all honestly was mind <mark>blow</mark>ingly good. I&#x27;ve been around for a while, and had more than my share of lovers and relationships, but this kind of more than just physical experience is something if not totally new then rare enough that I can&#x27;t remember it, it happened so long ago. 

&amp;nbsp;


I&#x27;m instantly hooked. I feel like a 18 year old again tbh, but I don&#x27;t show it - I&#x27;m not a *total* idiot.

&amp;nbsp;


We see each other maybe once or twice a week for a few weeks - sex just gets better and better -  when we are together, she is wonderfully attentive and our interactions are those of a couple very comfortable with each other. we tell each other a lot. However it&#x27;s new so no feelings or intents about the future are discussed. who wants to spoil the mood with awkward stuff like that? 

&amp;nbsp;


it all seems to be going swimmingly well, apart from... She seems to put me at the last position on her priority list. I&#x27;m pretty understanding of this at first, new job, she has good relationships with her friends and they have a pretty active social life, which is also good, I like a lot of &#x27;me&#x27; time. But eventually it borders on insulting in the way she schedules me into her week. I start getting annoyed at how awkward she is about fitting me into her life, <mark>blow</mark>ing off my requests for seemingly inconsequential &#x27;better options&#x27;, and ask her point blank what&#x27;s going on, say I see a lot of potential with us, and i want to see where we could go, but I need a bit more effort from her..

&amp;nbsp;


Her reply is basically:

&amp;nbsp;


*&quot;When I first met you I thought I was in a place where I wanted a boyfriend and to start a new relationship, but over the last couple of weeks i&#x27;ve had to focus so much on my job and I&#x27;ve just been enjoying being selfish and doing whatever i want, I don&#x27;t think I can commit right now and think I&#x27;ve been leading you on, I feel so horrible about it, I&#x27;m such a bitch&quot;* That&#x27;s the general gist.

&amp;nbsp;


When I asked her what she actually wanted from me, she said all she could offer right now was &quot;fun&quot;.

&amp;nbsp;


Honestly, at that point, I knew the smart thing to do would be to run, but I couldn&#x27;t. I said I&#x27;d give it a shot just being FWB and see how it goes.

&amp;nbsp;


That was a few weeks ago. 

&amp;nbsp;


Since then, we&#x27;re still more than FWB&#x27;s, we text all day, we even talk on the phone which I never do, the sex has gotten even better - maybe because she feels like she can be honest with me now about what she likes - very rough dominant kind of stuff from me, which I&#x27;m fine with, but tells me a lot about what makes her tick.

&amp;nbsp;


**I also learnt more about her relationship history, she has opened up to me a lot. Her ex did the same thing to her she did to me in the sense she gave herself to him, and he totally ruined her. Mentally as well as physically, he controlled her life, not allowing her to dress the way she wanted, or see her friends. He moved away and got engaged, but still kept her in this city as a pet almost, and he would visit and just force anal sex on her as it doesn&#x27;t count as cheating on his fiance. she would have to sit quietly while he skyped with his girl. Pretty fucked up, and it&#x27; makes a lot of her behaviour very easy to understand.**

&amp;nbsp;


As everyone would no doubt tell me to, I started dating again. for two reasons:

&amp;nbsp;


 - One, in the hope that I&#x27;d meet a girl who would break the spell and let me shake off this intense attraction I have for her, and 
 - two; to see what reaction I&#x27;d get from her.

&amp;nbsp;


She&#x27;s acted very nonchalant about the fact I&#x27;m seeing other girls, sometimes seeming a bit turned on by it, but a few times has let jealousy slip out, and hastily corrected herself so she doesn&#x27;t look vulnerable. She&#x27;s playing it too cool you know?

&amp;nbsp;


I&#x27;m at the point now, where I&#x27;ve met an incredibly beautiful, sweet girl that is super into me, but I would drop in a second if my FWB asked me to.

&amp;nbsp;


I&#x27;ve discovered that I&#x27;m not particularly suited for dating more than one person at once - I just focus all my emotional availability on one person, and thats hardly fair to anyone else. It&#x27;s obvious I need to make a decision about what to do.

&amp;nbsp;


Should I grit my teeth and settle in for the long haul, and see if i can break through this girl&#x27;s self protective wall, I get the feeling the rewards would be as immense as failure would be crushing. it&#x27;s been so long since I felt this way about anyone, I&#x27;m very aware that I might never experience it again. That makes me want to take the risk.

&amp;nbsp;


or...

&amp;nbsp;



Just save myself the heartache and give up on her completely?

&amp;nbsp;


FYI, as I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will say &quot;its because she wants to fuck other dudes&quot;. Yeah maybe. however we&#x27;ve been pretty open about this, and I&#x27;m pretty sure she hasn&#x27;t in the time we&#x27;ve been seeing each other. she&#x27;s just too busy with her job and friends. Hell, if she didn&#x27;t think the sex was as mind-<mark>blow</mark>ing as I do, she probably would have left me to it weeks ago. I don&#x27;t know what she&#x27;d do if the opportunity fell into her lap, but so far, I don&#x27;t think I have competition.

&amp;nbsp;

   
**tl;dr**: I like a girl way too much, she&#x27;s emotionally unavailable because reasons. Is it worth putting in the effort to win her over? I can&#x27;t think straight and I need some perspective.</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xxbu3/i_26f_am_wanting_to_divorce_my_husband_27m_of_a/" target="_blank" class="title">I (26/f) am wanting to divorce my husband (27/m) of a year because his mother (52/f) cannot respect anyone</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I am so sorry ahead of time for seeming so angry.


My husband (27/m) and I (26/f) have been happily married for a year--we&#x27;ve dated for three years prior to the marriage.


Before I married my husband, I met him when he lived with his mom. He was not someone I was interested in--partly because he did not have aspirations and was rather lazy. Anyway, we hung out several times as friends and I slowly became interested as he began to mature. Despite all of these factors, we decided to casually date.


In the beginning, his mom was rather involved but I assumed it was only because she wanted to see what kind of person his son was seeing. Anyway, I really liked her during this time.  She was funny, nice, and encouraging to our relationship. However, the first night she made a racist joke (I am a mixed woman, half Brazilian and half German). I ignored it as I didn&#x27;t want to be dramatic. But the jokes became more frequent and it really felt like a red flag.


As time went by though, My now husband became more independent and asked to move in with me. I was happy. We moved in and it was kind of bumpy at first with chores, but he eventually got the hang of it and helped a lot. Anyhow, during this timeframe I was filing a report against a man that had raped me in my teens before the statute of limitations prevented me from doing so. I was experiencing emotional issues that led me to have panic attacks. I was so sick and did not have insurance at the time. My husband knew I needed psychiatric help so he said that we should get married so I can get the care I needed. I told him I was nervous because it would upset our families. Anyhow, he responded with: I love you and you love me--we are happy despite all of this and your well being is more important than whether my mother gets butt hurt right now. Maybe it was a mistake--but we got married, and were very, very happy (and still are, despite her).

Fast forward to now--I am healthy and mentally recovered from that ordeal. He and I became very independent, did well financially, both are in careers/schools we love. 


Whenever I saw her--she was always snide. We couldn&#x27;t do anything without criticism: if we bought an computer we were basically scolded, when we got dogs she flipped out, when he got me an engagement ring she was mad over the cost, whenever he got me a gift--she wanted something more elaborate, whenever we were around--she wanted to hug him and be held by him, she would ask about this bank account, tell me what color I should dye my hair, tell us that we eat bad, tell us that we weren&#x27;t religious enough, complain because we didn&#x27;t vote Republican, etc. etc. My husband would look at me almost in embarrassment. I told him, &quot;if we tell her we are married--she will get even worse...what do we do?&quot; He said, &quot;if she&#x27;s acting like that over stupid shit then let&#x27;s not even stress about it right now. I&#x27;m just mad I can&#x27;t even have a second without her trying to control me.&quot;

It was overbearing. Anyway, one day he brought up the idea that he wanted a child--before he could give her the news that I had an unfortunate miscarriage. She said that our kids would have developmental disorders, be disfigured, oh--and &quot;mixed&quot; (as if that&#x27;s a bad thing). At this point, I was just like--&quot;we really shouldn&#x27;t have gotten married. HOW can I deal with her?&quot; Again, he told me--&quot;can we just cut her off? I just want you to get the treatment you deserve without her ruining all that we have.&quot;


It only got worse. She then started being all sorts of religious and  tried to bring Jesus into our lives. I told her that I had my beliefs--but that didn&#x27;t stop her. I did not want to have issues with her so I just tried to ignore it. She would try to force us to go to these super church gatherings, tried forcing me to donate hundreds of dollars, etc. I just had to back away, again.


My husband brought up marriage.  She stated: &quot;why would you marry her--not only does she have medical issues (from the rape, mind you), but she is controlling.&quot;  Anyway, when I heard about it I was evidently upset but I never told him to cut her off. I just said she was always mean to me and I didn&#x27;t understand it.


She finally crossed the line when she told my husband that he should join the military or move back home because my family are &quot;probably a bunch of illegals.&quot; He kindly asked her to respect me multiple times prior to this--many times in which he asked me whether we should cut her off. My answer was always, &quot;no, she is still your mother.&quot; 

I was really, really upset with her. When we saw her after this--I didn&#x27;t want to confront her but she then said something about my husband&#x27;s grandparents probably having STDs and then that his dad had a small penis (this was said in front of 10+ people during a family dinner). My husband got really red in the face and was about to lose it.

Anyway, he decided to cut her off. It&#x27;s been, many months and she still tries to get information about us through other family members. She leaves messages, e-mails, texts, voicemails and he just deletes them. All of the messages are along the lines of, &quot;you will miss me when I die&quot;....almost as if she&#x27;s trying to guilt trip him.

Throughout this time--she&#x27;s fabricated stories that I: have serious mental issues, have serious illnesses, am controlling, beat him, have verbally attacked her, sleep around, etc. Just horrible, horrible things. 

I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I just want to leave. Eventually, he will have to talk to her again. Furthermore, I cannot face this woman after all of the humiliations she has had me endure. Since I am finally stepping up and for once told her to, &quot;fuck off&quot;--my phone has been <mark>blow</mark>ing up from random numbers telling me I am horrible. I know it is her. Although I love my husband dearly, I also have to realize that he is making a major sacrifice by cutting off his family in order to be with me. I want children and do not want to bring them up in an environment where they have to see a divided family and on top of that--a grandmother that cannot control her mouth. She does not have to like me--but she should at least attempt to keep her mouth shut.  


If I were doing drugs, <mark>sleeping</mark> around, being a bad influence--I understand.  But, at the end of the day I am a medical student, with nothing but a desire to love her son, and to try to be as successful as I can be in my marriage and personal life. However, this woman will not back down--will not learn. I know marriage is about going through thick and thin, but I just cannot stand the thought of dealing with a narcissistic, jealous, racist woman that attacks not only me--but my entire family.

**tl;dr**: My mother in law is trying to destroy my marriage through humiliation and manipulation, my husband cutting her off makes me feel terrible--contemplating divorce.

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right place to post this, so if it isn&#x27;t, I apologize.

I am a college student who lives at home and works part-time. My relationship with my parents is somewhat strained; although they were abusive, they are slowly getting better, partly since  I am not home as much. Aside from occasional arguments that can <mark>blow</mark> up stemming from previous events, I obey their rules, keep my grades up, and do well at work so that I&#x27;m not on their bad side.

My parents recently bought a car for me to use to commute to school and work, since they are in two different cities. It cost around $19k, so they transferred $7k from my bank account to help fund the car. I pay for my own gas and personal expenses other than groceries. School is about ~20 minutes away, 30 with traffic. The commute is a little bit annoying, but I can deal with it. My work is 20 minutes from school, 40 minutes from home. 

My friend recently asked me if I would be interested in renting out an apartment with her and two others for the next semester. The apartment we are looking at has a 1-year minimum lease, and the price is a bit steep in that area.

There are a couple of issues with my moving out:

1. My parents will definitely not support my decision if I do decide to move out. It is against our culture, and they want me to be under their watchful eye under all times. My mom has a pretty prominent social name in our tight-knit community, so me moving out of the house would be quite degrading for her. There would be lots of turmoil. One of those things will include taking my car away, which I could probably get used to since public transportation is really common in that area. Whenever my dad and I have arguments, it extends to him saying that I should find a new place to live (he doesn&#x27;t mean it), and if I do move out, he will take my car away and make sure that I get fired at my job, something that he helped me get in my field through his connections.

2. Work will be really difficult to go to. Public transport in the city I work at is not common at all, so I really don&#x27;t know how I would be able to get there. The job pays really well too (twice minimum wage!), and is a hard type of job to find at my age, where minimum wage jobs are the norm.

3. Although my parents say that they will take the car away, I have no way to guarantee that they will transfer the $7k back to my bank account. They also took out $5k from my account for a graduation party they basically <mark>forced</mark> me to have. I don&#x27;t know if there is any way I can recover that money. My dad has access to all of my bank expenses.

4. The rent is really expensive for the apartment, but it could be something I can pay off if I work hard enough. I currently have my own room that I live in rent-free, and I have the nice amenities of laundry, my own bathroom, food, my dog, etc.

5. My parents will most likely stop funding my education. I want to get out of college loan-free, is it worth taking out loans to get out of the house? My area of study basically guarantees me a job straight out of college, although I do want to attend grad school.

6. food. my mom makes most of the food i eat, so i would have to support myself with food.

However, some reasons I do want to move out are:

1. I don&#x27;t really see my relationship with my parents getting any better in the future. They&#x27;ve only gotten better since I&#x27;m not in the house, so I just don&#x27;t deal with them as much; that doesn&#x27;t mean that they have changed in any way.

2. They enforce pretty strict rules. I&#x27;m a pretty responsible person, and although I may have royally screwed up high school in their eyes, I&#x27;m really not as bad as they seem. I am maintaining a 4.0 GPA as well as working at a job in my field (engineering) part-time. I&#x27;m also on track to graduate early from my college. Some of their rules include - they have to know where I am at all times, I have to be home by 9 latest, no hanging out/talking to boys, no relationships, clothing is deemed appropriate by them (no tank tops, shorts even in summer), they start to throw a fit if I come home at 9 every day because i can&#x27;t just hang out with people all the time (most of the time i&#x27;m studying on campus). I haven&#x27;t gone out on the weekends ever since college started because they think college is full of really bad influences. They don&#x27;t hesitate to call me names or ruin my self-confidence when they can, and some days it&#x27;s hard for me to sit in my room and study when they&#x27;re outside, seemingly ready to attack. i&#x27;m recovering from depression and anxiety from the way they used to treat me and still do, to a certain extent. i am still emotionally abused, but there is no more physical abuse.

i have a boyfriend who i love to see when i can, but he lives an hour away. i would also like to hang out past 9 (responsibly!) and have guy friends without worrying about what my parents would say. 

3. Living on my own may help me grow as a person, become more independent, and overall be a positive experience.

4. I&#x27;ll be able to enjoy myself a little more, even though studies and work will always be my #1 priority.

Let me know if you need more context about the scenario! I&#x27;ll be happy to discuss it. Thanks everyone :)

TL;DR: Thinking of moving out to gain some independence, want to know what&#x27;s the best decision to make.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Alright, sorry for the wall of text, this <mark>blow</mark> up is the culmination of a lifetime of toxicity, and I want to make it thorough enough you can give me advice. Also sorry if I sound really stilted, I&#x27;m a mess right now


This all started because my dysfunctional brother, Jack, is trying to curry favor with my family. He can be really manipulative, and cruel, and now he&#x27;s stepped it up to 11 because he&#x27;s gotten arrested for the second time and is being <mark>forced</mark> to move in with them. He&#x27;s on drugs, in and out of bad relationships, and accusing everyone abandoning him.

Last time I was with the whole family, Jack constantly berated me in front of my mom, saying passive aggressive things about anything I said. She lets this kind of stuff slide because she thinks my dad shows favoritism towards me, which really isn&#x27;t true, Jack just does a LOT to get in trouble, like get arrested for gun possession. Of course you&#x27;re going to be mad at him more than you are his homebody sibling.

And there&#x27;s another layer to this too. My mom is awful, and she&#x27;s probably the worst to me, partially because she grew up with only her sisters and her (probably NPD) mom. When I was growing up, she was incredibly unstable. I remember hearing her come home and running to my room so I wouldn&#x27;t get yelled at. I could tell what mood she was in just by how she closed the door to the garage. She took a LOT of her anger out on me, calling me selfish, never taking my bullying seriously, telling me I was going to end up living in their basement, etc. She called me selfish once because my therapy meant she couldn&#x27;t get the kitchen renovated (not true), and she was stuck miserable in that house with no friends.

Needless to say, I realized my mom was a shitty person pretty early on and influenced a lot of my anxiety and depression. Back when Jack wasn&#x27;t such a raging asshole, I confided in him some of my feelings. Now he&#x27;s told her I said I had &quot;a bad childhood,&quot; which really set off her narcissism. She called me trying to guilt trip me for all that she thinks she&#x27;s done for me (some examples are hosting pool parties, getting my favorite snacks, basically a lot of favors where emotional support were suspiciously absent). I freeze up and tell her I&#x27;m not talking about this. 

I figure out who did it through my dad, and was gonna just let it slide when Jack texted me &quot;Come visit me before I leave!&quot; as in before he moves in with my parents. In a fit of anger I say no and tell him why. It was stupid, I know.

So apparently he runs to my mom and acts really sweet and innocent, texting, &quot;Why&#x27;d you tell Burrito what I told you? That&#x27;s not very nice momma now she won&#x27;t come see me.&quot;

Her reply? Basically that I have decided I to blame her for my &quot;shitty life,&quot; that I don&#x27;t care about or love her which is fine because now she has one less person to worry about. Saying that I hurt her, and that she had put her life behind mine and Jacks, that I was ungrateful, that i accused her of seeking attention after she got cancer (which wtf??? no I didn&#x27;t) and ending ominously with &quot;I&#x27;ll always love you, but I&#x27;ll never be the Mother you once had.&quot;

How do I know this?? She sent it to me. She&#x27;s probably, knowing her, telling everyone lies about me.

And here&#x27;s the thing: She has her 50th this month and I&#x27;m supposed to fly and see her. I told my dad I wasn&#x27;t going to and he told me I couldn&#x27;t do that. He then sent a text to Jack and I saying we should forgive her even though she will never ask for an apology, and that the last few months have been hard on everyone. This is his usual tactic unfortunately, even after all he&#x27;s seen her do to me. 

Reddit, I can&#x27;t see her like this. I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s only been a year and half since I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt. I&#x27;ve been so much better but they&#x27;re trying to send me right back. I know that sounds dramatic but since I&#x27;ve gotten that text this morning i have barely left my bed. I am financially dependent on them, especially since the suicide attempt where I had to drop out of school. My anxiety and depression were heaps better but now, here I am, back in that dark place. What do I do? How can I survive this? All I want is to escape but idk what that would be.



   
**tl;dr**: Mom acts like a sewer monster, brother is her crony, dad wants me to pretend everything is fine even though this could put me in the psychiatric unit again. Feeling lost, alone, desperate.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">This girl and I have been dating for three months over the summer and we&#x27;ve been really happy together until very recently when she started <mark>blow</mark>ing off dates and acting odd over chat. We go to the same school, but don&#x27;t live all that close. 


Some more background: She and I were extremely close best friends, sharing almost everything with each other, but not romantically interested until this summer. We liked each other in early June, but she was somewhat hesitant to get into a relationship for a number of reasons including the fact that her best friend used to like me. And in addition, her past relationships haven&#x27;t been great and so she was worried that history would repeat itself. We talked about all the potential ramifications of getting together, not getting together, friends with benefits and so on, and ultimately decided to pursue a conventional relationship.


Essentially, as I found out today, she actually felt/<mark>forced</mark> into our relationship. She said that I had told her then that it would be hard for me to resume friendship as normal, were we to decide against a relationship. And she said that that risk of losing our friendship factored into her decision, and that she now felt blackmailed.




To provide my perspective, I had never in a thousand years intended to blackmail or force her into a relationship, and I was taken aback by her concern. Considering myself a romantic, to use the term loosely, I find the idea of having someone like me for anything other than me revulsive. Indeed, I made it explicit to her when I was courting her that I didn&#x27;t want her decision to be influenced by whether or not our friendship would be okay or whether I&#x27;d feel bad.


That having been said, I did mention to her then that I wouldn&#x27;t be sure about how I&#x27;d take returning to just friendship, and I did say that I might have to distance myself a bit for a little while initially so as not to remain fraught with emotion or anxious as we both moved on. I did not say our friendship would be over, merely that I would have to get over her, and that it would take some time.


In response to my perspective, she said that while the intent may not have been there, that was the impact and that she&#x27;s now troubled by the whole situation.




With all this in mind, she wants to talk tomorrow at length about the whole thing. She says she still likes me and that is not an issue, at least not yet, but she wants to talk about it. I need help on what to say and how to approach this whole situation. I&#x27;ve already apologized for inadvertently causing her strife, but I&#x27;m not sure what more I can do and I feel terrible.


   
**tl;dr**: Been dating a girl for three months. we were initially very close friends. It came up during the time we were trying to make it official that our friendship would be compromised in the short term, were we to chose not to be a couple, due to the fact that I&#x27;d have to get over her. She now feels that I blackmailed her intentionally or otherwise, by threatening our friendship. What do I do? </div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3for9z/26f_so_confused_about_relationship_with_my/" target="_blank" class="title">[26/F] SO confused about relationship with my boyfriend [27/M] an ex, [28/M] and men in general.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I apologize in advance for how long this might be, but I feel like it&#x27;s absolutely necessary in order to get the advice I really need. I&#x27;ll try to be as succinct and factual as possible. 


So let me start at the beginning - from the time I was 3 years old (by admission of my father) to when I finally left his house when I was 15, my father sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me and raped me. I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18, put on medication, and entered therapy. I finally worked up the courage to press charges several years ago and got a recorded phone call of him admitting to everything, which subsequently led to his arrest. He was charged with 10 counts of sexual child abuse. Just a month or two ago after a 3 year litigation process, he finally took the plea deal for 30 years, meaning all of it is finally over and I can begin to heal rather than cope. 



Despite the abuse, call it Stockholm Syndrome, call it whatever you want, but unlike most abuse survivors, I have never been angry. I don&#x27;t hate him, I don&#x27;t want him to be hurt, I&#x27;ve only ever been heartbroken, I love my father and adored him. I only ever wanted his approval for everything and would have lied, cheated, stolen, killed just to make him happy. Most of the reason it took me so long to press charges was because of the guilt I felt at the idea of putting him in prison. My first memories of him that come to mind are not of the abuse, but of dancing with him to his favorite country music and him teaching me how to swim, the sober days when everything was great. I think it may be part of my PTSD and my brain&#x27;s method of coping, but instead of remembering the person my father really is, remembering the things he did to me, the horrible things he said, I remember the man I loved and lost. 



This exact problem has bled over into every relationship I&#x27;ve ever had, making moving on from relationships unbelievably painful and difficult. Realizing when I&#x27;m in/was in an abusive relationship (or even just a relationship should end) is goddamn near impossible until 20/20 hindsight finally comes around like a year later after he&#x27;s dumped me. If I&#x27;m in love with a guy, ESPECIALLY if he&#x27;s hurt me, all I can think of and see are the good things about him, the happy memories, and tend to forget the bad things, the traumatic memories, the reasons I shouldn&#x27;t be with this person. 



Ever since I found out about the plea deal and all this being over, I&#x27;ve found my confusion about men has intensified immensely and I really need some help. 



Obviously all this in itself would be enough for me to have issues surrounding men, but it goes even deeper than that. I&#x27;m not sure if you can chalk it up to the abuse we both endured or not, what he witnessed, but my older brother expressed his issues with being sexually attracted to me when I was 18. He hasn&#x27;t really brought it up since, but I know it&#x27;s still something he still deals with, certain hints come up in conversation sometimes. He never acted upon it or ever tried to do anything to me, and certainly not against my will, but nevertheless, this affected me. 



Then there&#x27;s my stepfather. First of all, I feel I should mention that neither he or my mother had any idea about the sexual abuse until I finally left my father&#x27;s house when I was 15, they lived out of state. They knew he drank and was generally an asshole, but nothing to that extent. I always loved my stepfather and was pretty close to him since he and my mother married when I was 9, even began using his (and my mother&#x27;s) last name once I moved out of my father&#x27;s house, etc. But there was always this bit of distance between us that I couldn&#x27;t figure out the origin of, it always bothered me a little. I wanted to just call him &quot;Dad&quot; and be done with it, but it didn&#x27;t feel quite right. I found out what the problem was when I was about 20, maybe 21. 



After a day out with him and my family, he pulled me aside to sit me down and talk to me about something. He then expressed his own issues with being sexually attracted to me, something he had apparently struggled with for a long time. I asked if he had spoken with my mother about this, he said he had. I suggested maybe it was because I&#x27;m a lot like my mom, looked like her, he retorted that that wasn&#x27;t it either (I knew full well I looked nothing like my mother, I just was trying to find an explanation.) He said he had always been confused because of something about the way I acted, treated him, that he had had to &quot;control&quot; himself around me. I still have no idea what he was really talking about, I never flirted with him, never felt ANY kind of attraction towards him and never crossed any boundaries, never sat on his lap or whatever, never really even kissed him on cheek. I can think of a handful of times I kissed him on the cheek and in hindsight and I think the nature of the kiss was pretty clear - me saying good night to my stepfather. I didn&#x27;t ask him to elaborate because I was so disturbed and really didn&#x27;t want to know more at that time, and was completely heartbroken. I started to cry and told him how much that hurt me, how I only ever wanted a father, that I had only ever seen him as my father and wanted him to be that, that I took his last name because of that. He apologized and said he felt our conversation had cleared a lot of that up for him and that he would be a father to me, would only see me as his daughter, but I told him I was still heartbroken. I consider my stepfather to be a kind, sweet, empathetic, pragmatic, logical, yet emotional man and is by far the most intelligent person I&#x27;ve ever known. I appreciated the fact that he had spoken to my mother about it, but the only thought I had was, &quot;both of my mother&#x27;s husbands have had a strong enough sexual attraction to me to cause problems,&quot; and what that must have made her feel. Ever since then, it has never come up and he has made every effort to be nothing but a supportive, loving, doting father to me, but it&#x27;s just not the same for me now. The only man I felt could be my father had just become yet another man in my family I feel uncomfortable around in my bathing suit. 



Every single man in my immediate family has been sexually attracted to me, and it has done such long lasting, serious damage to my self esteem. What worth do I have as a person when the men who are related to me, closest to me, know everything about me, and are supposed to protect me only seem to see what I look like? So much so that they felt the need to talk to me about it? I wish he had never told me. On one hand, it was clearly bothering him enough to need to talk to me, but on the other, I wish he would&#x27;ve just confided in my mother and a therapist. This has done such serious damage to me.



That all being said, I obviously have issues with how I relate to men. My whole world seems to be boy-centric no matter how fucking much I hate it and try to work against it, but I guess it&#x27;s just deeply ingrained in my psychology at this point. Since I was 17, I&#x27;ve spent maybe a year, a year and a half being single. I&#x27;ve tried resisting and just staying single, but for one reason or another, I can never do it. I feel like that has something to do with my need to be loved, to feel safe, to feel wanted for who I am because I place my self-worth in the hands of men, no matter how much I try to tell myself I only need MY OWN approval. I&#x27;ve been a serial monogamist. I have extreme trust issues and boundary issues. Once I&#x27;m in love with someone, I bend over backwards and change my behaviors just to make them happy. One night stands do not happen in my world. Ever. An emotional connection and attraction is a required prerequisite to a physical one. (aka demi-sexual/demi-romantic). I&#x27;ve worked through much of my sexual limitations and problems, I do enjoy sex, just not with someone I don&#x27;t feel I know, trust, and vice versa. 



Which brings us to my boyfriend, let&#x27;s call him James. I&#x27;ve known James since I was 18 and a freshman in college. He&#x27;s does stand up comedy, which can already tell you about what he&#x27;s like - hysterically funny, a sweetheart, sensitive, approval-seeking, self-deprecating, loyal - but also can be sarcastic, negative, dramatic, immature, unhealthy. He&#x27;s struggled with alcohol and dependency issues for as long as I&#x27;ve known him, albeit he&#x27;s gotten sooo much better this last year since he started therapy. He has a dark sense of humor and has an old soul like me. He&#x27;s been through a lot, like me. We dated for 6 months in my freshman year and the breakup was painful and messy. I was extremely emotionally unstable and was admitted to the psychiatric ward for a week following a suicide attempt, which is when I was first diagnosed with PTSD. James was my first real love and it took me years to fully move on from him. Even after we broke up, we spent a year playing the game of being involved but never dating, always arguing, always drama until we finally completely stopped talking. We didn&#x27;t speak for a few years until I decided to press charges against my father. He had overheard a conversation I&#x27;d had with my father on the phone talking about the abuse, so I asked if he would be a witness for the prosecution. He said of course and we reconnected and became friends again. 



I moved to the city he lived in (basically the capital for our industry) and we became very close friends. The relationship started becoming a little weird almost immediately, though. For years, we had this close friend, yet pseudo-dating like feel to our relationship, he would call me sweetie and just generally act like a bf sometimes, even going as far as to kiss me once or twice in a kind of sweet, loving way, but not necessarily romantic, would cuddle and shit, sometimes he would stay over when I was having really bad night terrors. Nothing ever really happened, never got physical, never dated, it was just a weird in between the lines kind of deal, boundaries not being set, etc. I watched him go through breakups and new relationships and vice versa. I had no feelings left for him, but over time, it became apparent it was not the same for him. He was jealous of every guy I dated and could never hang out with us, even in a group of people. Over the last few years, this had become more and more of a problem until finally I told him he needed to be my friend and nothing else, that it wasn&#x27;t fair that he could talk to me about his girl problems, but yet I could never even mention the name of a guy. He eventually pulled himself together and was able to put his feelings aside and just be my friend and things were great. There wasn&#x27;t really any more blurring lines of boundaries between friends and dating, it was kind of nice. 



Then this past December, I met this guy - let&#x27;s call him Chris. Slowly but surely, as I&#x27;ve figured myself out, I&#x27;ve learned things I want and need in a relationship, things about myself, gained confidence to wear the clothes I want to wear, to look the way I want to look instead of hiding behind ill-fitting clothes in an attempt to hide my looks/insecurity, date better and better guys who treat me well, etc. So Chris is absolutely GORGEOUS. By far and away the most attractive guy I&#x27;ve ever been with - which of course made me a little insecure, because sex was almost like a commodity to him - he could get it whenever he wanted. Now, that wasn&#x27;t how he operated, but he could - and has had periods where he did lots of <mark>sleeping</mark> around via okcupid. This man is best described as a walking, talking cartoon Disney character in the body of a Disney prince. Extremely goofy and spazzy like me, makes a lot of puns, loves musicals and Disney movies, loves to dance, a total sweetheart, cries at the drop of a hat, but yet athletic, muscular and very much a pseudo-frat boy despite having never been in one. He played rugby and wrestling in college, lots of beer pong and drinking, went to those kinds of parties, had friends who were in frats, everything I would consider a totally normal, stereotypical guy. 



Big problem that I thought was a great, wonderful thing about him, but ended up being a huge deal - Chris has had an extremely easy life. He has never had a true heartbreak, never had a death in the family, never had to deal with ANYTHING. He&#x27;s been very blessed, never had financial problems, had a great, functional family, got an extremely good job right off the bat after moving here, is very successful, hard working (he&#x27;s always concerned he&#x27;s not doing enough work, even though I literally would have to &quot;book&quot; my time with him a week out because of all the classes he would take, all the friends that wanted to hang out with him, etc) He is everything my mind has ever wanted - a &quot;normal,&quot; healthy, functional man. So functional, so &quot;normal,&quot; a guy who has regular movie nights with friends (and lots of friends), doesn&#x27;t have any problems with drinking or personal demons, just what I thought would be a great influence on me. 



We started dating and were fucking CRAZY about each other - at first. The first month was wonderful. Then it became apparent that as much as he wanted to understand me, to support me, to help me, to love me, he just couldn&#x27;t relate to or understand the depth of my darkness, my past, my emotions, my turbulence. He couldn&#x27;t give me what I needed because he couldn&#x27;t relate to me at all. He had no idea where to start. I felt like I was this darkness enveloping him and he was a ball of pure, innocent light. My sense of humor can be really dark because I&#x27;ve been through a lot - he has a good sense of humor, but there were times when he thought I was serious about something awful when I was absolutely joking. He would get afraid to bring things up to me, was afraid of me in general, despite me never <mark>blow</mark>ing up at him or being too dependent. He was afraid of how I can explode and vent and get angry or panic or have a flashback or talk about a memory. It was just too much for him, I think. My friends and family call him weak. I think he needs to have a thicker skin for sure, because what happens when something bad finally DOES happen to him? But I wouldn&#x27;t say weak. 



We broke up (more specifically, he broke up with me) in April and ever since then, I just can&#x27;t seem to move past this pain over it. I know how he made me feel, especially towards the end - like I was broken, there was something wrong with me, and that&#x27;s not okay. I have PTSD, I&#x27;m not broken, I&#x27;m out of order. I know it takes a certain kind of person to love me, to have patience with me, to understand me - and he just can&#x27;t. I know I&#x27;m not for the faint of heart. I know some people can totally &quot;get&quot; you and vibe with you and feel your energy and some just don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s how it is. But as I spoke about earlier on in this post, I can&#x27;t let it go. I can&#x27;t let go of how much I love him as a person, how good the sex was and how comfortable he made me feel with all of that, how happy he made me, how NORMAL he was - but I KNOW I&#x27;m putting a microscope on the good things and ignoring the bad. I know I&#x27;m trying to live up to my own ideals of what &quot;normal&quot; is when I should just accept that I will never be normal, and that&#x27;s okay. But I&#x27;m hung up on him for some fucking reason. I want him, I get these impulses to call him, and I have no idea why, yet I know he would be back to making me insane with how busy his schedule is, back to making me feel not good enough, not normal within minutes. 



So fast forward to James, my current boyfriend. We&#x27;ve known each other and have a history together that now goes back nearly 10 years. We started going back to that &quot;in between&quot; place in our relationship I spoke about before within a month after Chris and I broke up, even though I definitely still had feelings for Chris. I hadn&#x27;t really been thinking about James in a romantic way, but we went and saw Age of Ultron together and had a cute little kiss. I hadn&#x27;t even thought about dating him, I didn&#x27;t know what to make of it. I certainly didn&#x27;t have any strong feelings, at least not on the surface. In July (and a week after that kiss at Ultron) he started to date some girl who was AWFUL (and trust me, she was, don&#x27;t even get me started) which sparked jealousy in me, which was bizarre. I wasn&#x27;t thinking about him, wasn&#x27;t wanting him like that, yet there I was, horribly jealous and hurt. 


I expressed what I was feeling and things got messy. After a month or so of him dating this girl, she cheated on him and we found out that she had been stringing him along with this psychotic lie about who she was - come to find out not even her name was real. The fact that I got so hurt over him dating this girl made that information sting all the more, and he apologized profusely for hurting me over a girl who was insane and insignificant in the long run. He blamed the relationship on his desire to get over me and date someone new. But after they broke up, the subject of him and I dating got put on the table and I found myself really, really wanting to have the same kind of absolute, utter devotion he has to me. Not to say I&#x27;m not devoted to him or don&#x27;t love him, but he takes that shit to another level. I started to have some feelings for him, and frankly, really just wanted to feel the same way he did. 



I felt like, here&#x27;s someone who understands me, has never abandoned me, knows everything about me, knows how to take care of me, and is absolutely crazy, head over heels in love with me. I should at least give it a chance. I owe him and our relationship that much, because I would rather know than have the &quot;what if.&quot; I thought maybe the feelings I have for him are deep beneath the surface, maybe I&#x27;ve been repressing those feelings... I don&#x27;t know. Obviously my reaction to that girl showed I feel SOMETHING. 

But here I am confused about how I even feel about him. Some moments, I think oh my God, he&#x27;s so sweet, so wonderful to me, he&#x27;s so cute, just a heart of gold. And yet I am so fucking frustrated because I just do not feel the same way he does. I do not feel passion. It&#x27;s been 2 months now, and I&#x27;m still struggling to get on his level. A relationship with him makes sense, he&#x27;s my best friend, obviously we find each other attractive. The sex with him isn&#x27;t fantastic, so that&#x27;s kind of throwing me because I&#x27;m really weird and finicky about sex for obvious reasons. Not to say the kid has to be a fucking casanova in bed, but there&#x27;s some kind of connection missing, some kind of &quot;click&quot; that isn&#x27;t happening or falling into place. I keep finding myself comparing him to Chris, which really isn&#x27;t fair, but it&#x27;s just in my head. 

I don&#x27;t know what the fuck to do. I want so badly to just be deeply in love with him, to just take it easy and let things develop as they may, to stop thinking about it so much, but the feeling I have for Chris when I think about him, that angst is stronger than the intensity of what I feel on the surface for James. I&#x27;m not willing to just throw it away after everything he and I have been through, how far we&#x27;ve come and how long we&#x27;ve known each other, everything he&#x27;s done for me, especially because I do not want to hurt him. But I&#x27;m just at a total fucking loss as to what to do. I feel like my head changes on this subject day to day ranging from full on panic because I want out and to run away to being content and just letting things be the way they are and waiting for things to fall into place.

Once again, I am SO sorry for how long this is, but it&#x27;s complicated as fuck. Please, please help. I&#x27;ve tried talking to him about this, how I&#x27;m back and forth and confused, but he just doesn&#x27;t want me to leave him. I&#x27;ve tried therapy, but I just can&#x27;t seem to pin down what&#x27;s wrong here. Should I be with this man? Am I just hung up on Chris because of my tried and tested psychology about men, especially since he rejected me? Am I forcing something? Just any feedback would be killer. Even just on how I relate to men in general.... I&#x27;m just a mess. I feel so lost and so confused.

**tl;dr:** Grew up in an extremely abusive environment, specifically sexual child abuse at the hands of my father, had to figure out how to deal with my older brother and step father both being physically attracted to me, so now I have trust issues and a lot of confusion about my ex, current bf, men, relationships, moving on, boundaries, saying no, etc. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;ve been thinking about doing this a while so here it goes. My fiance and I have been dating for 3.5 years. We are madly in love and I cannot imagine life without her. We met freshman year at UT, started off as friends with benefits, then developed into a loving couple. The sex was great (still is, but we&#x27;re not in the honeymoon phase anymore... and the pill sucks), we clicked on an intellectual and moral level, and we enjoyed spending time with each other. As we grew closer, we found that our goals in life were compatible and that we were both on the same page about kids, etc. One barrier was that she wanted her kids to be considered Jewish in Israel so I would have to convert. I was practically raised by Jews so this isn&#x27;t a problem. Aaaand we&#x27;re getting married (yay!). Now a little bit more about us. 


I grew up in the Boston area in a very Jewish part of town and moved to Austin for school. My parents are fairly liberal and have raised my siblings and I very well in my opinion. Lo and behold the woman I fall in love with in Austin is Jewish. I studied MIS/CS and have a very logical way of approaching things: I tend to compartmentalize, find the problem, and solve it. My fiance says I am not supposed to do this when she vents. I don&#x27;t really get why but ok.


She was raised in Houston and has a twin sister and her roots are in Israel where most of her family lives. Her family dynamic, though, is really rough. I&#x27;m not going to go into a lot of detail, but while my fiance was doing pre-med at UT, her sister dropped out and got involved with really shady people and has had to struggle with abortions, addictions, alcoholism, and abusive boyfriends for the past three years. The twin is a younger version of the mom, who is a complete narcissist, lazy, and forces my fiance to do everything for her (&quot;make me a sandwich&quot; [5 minutes later] &quot;no not like that&quot;, bitching and complaining at every restaurant, etc.). Needless to say the pair drive my fiance absolutely bat-shit crazy, get under her skin, and make her life a nightmare. They are completely unpredictable and will tear my fiance down just to ask her for things after. My fiance is a very caring a loving person who really values family, so, though she recognizes the abuse, it is hard for her to say no (&quot;but its my mom&quot;, etc.). I could go on and on about their influence on my fiance, but that&#x27;s a different topic for a different sub.


The problem lies in our fights. I&#x27;m going to come clean and let you all know that I am not developed well emotionally. I have a difficult time expressing my emotions and take a while processing what I should/shouldn&#x27;t say when I&#x27;m upset because before I met my fiance, I had never yelled at anyone for being mad. In fact, I had never been mad enough that storming off to my room and playing LEGOs couldn&#x27;t fix. It makes sense that I avoid fights and drama at all costs, often playing the pushover (fiance&#x27;s word) that people take advantage of. So it was a huge wakeup call my first fight with my fiance, who is used to screaming in order to be heard by her sister/mother who ignore her and treat her like shit.


Our first fights were ugly. I didn&#x27;t know how to handle the conflict so I would tend to retreat into my hole and wait for the storm to pass, but she&#x27;s the opposite. She needs to hash things out now, so she would prevent me from leaving. She would physically drag me back to the dorm/room or bar the door so we could continue to fight. So, not understanding what was going on, I would push her away. Run. Do whatever I could to get away. There were a few times she hit me, drawing blood once when she forgot her keys were in her hand. There were a few times I was just an inch away from hitting her, but I could never live with myself if I did and was always able to put my hand back down and take the spit and slaps and insults. 


The issue here is that during our fights, my fiance would turn into her mother and her sister and would use every little thing she had on me as ammunition to cut me down and bury me, just so that I was as miserable as she was and whether we were still talking about what started the fight (of which I was usually confused about what had set it off). The problem was/is that she can&#x27;t control it. She recognizes its wrong and she is confused about why she is saying/doing the things she is, but once she starts down that path, &quot;why stop&quot; was her response back then. You can imagine how I felt on the receiving end of all of this repressed anger. It was lovely...


That was our first year. I tried to break it off three times but she would always beg for forgiveness and promise it would never happen, so I would cave. Now, I know that a lot of red flags are going off here that may signal that this could be an abusive relationship. I&#x27;ll be honest, there are times I think it could have been, but not anymore. Every time after our fight we would be sitting there, bloodied (not really) and exhausted, crying and apologizing for what had happened. We love each other like we&#x27;ve loved no one else, and as time has passed, these fights have gone down in their frequency and intensity. We have both been making improvements: she has been trying not to threaten me during our fights (&quot;I&#x27;m calling the cops&quot;, &quot;I want to break up&quot;, &quot;I never want to talk to you again&quot; &gt; she admits that these are things she says to get my attention and are not serious) and has really made a lot of progress in not going crazy mom during our fights.


I have also tried to make progress in being more receptive to her emotions, not <mark>blow</mark>ing up at the slightest sign that something is wrong, and trying to stick with the fight as long as possible. I still try to take my breaks during the fights so I can cool down and process and try to avoid escalating to the point where I&#x27;m about to hit her. In exchange, my fiance has done a great job at letting me go, though there are still some compromises about when I&#x27;m allowed to leave a fight in the air that have yet to be determined. I have also tried not to internalize all of her insults, which is a problem I have. Everything stings, as it well and should, but I treat every fight like it could be our last. I get scared. And, honestly, most of the time I am completely at a loss why we are fighting (I use the term &quot;we&quot; here loosely) in the first place, as the initial problem is usually solved.


Since that year, our fights have also gone down in frequency. We&#x27;re learning more and more about what makes the other tick and how we can incorporate that into our lives. A Human Sexuality course in college also helped us figure out some techniques we could use in communicating and treating each other, like not bringing up old fights and not making rash decisions in the heat of the moment. I proposed to her in Israel last Winter on a mountain peak. It was nice.


Needless to say, there&#x27;s a lot of history, a lot of baggage that we carry around. Our past weighs down on us and we can&#x27;t help but feel those emotions that we felt that first year during our current fights. I think I&#x27;m a little better at forgiving and forgetting, and I understand that many of the fights we have are due to things I am doing that make her feel inadequate or unheard, for which I am making a conscious effort to improve. She bears a lot of guilt, though. My scar from that one bloody key punch is just now going away and she feels awful when she makes me cry from all the insults she sends my way during the bad fights. Although these bad ones are now once every other month (at most) rather than once every other week, she doesn&#x27;t see the improvement and feels so guilty about how she treats me during the bad times that she thinks she deserves nothing but to be alone and miserable forever. Here is a snippet from the catharsis from our most recent bad fight:


[...]

Her: &quot;exactly that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so embarrassed&quot;

Me: &quot;I don&#x27;t get it&quot;

Her: &quot;because you do so much and then I stab you in the back&quot;

Me: &quot;But you don&#x27;t. You do so much for me and then I do things that hurt you. Its not just you. I really think you&#x27;re being to harsh [...] I am terrified of being so mad and angry that I hit you&quot;

Her: &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t hit me&quot;

Me: &quot;I never ever want to raise my hand to you&quot;

Her: &quot;I would hit you way before&quot;

Me: &quot;I know. But there have been times I was a hair away from it and that terrifies me because you don&#x27;t deserve that&quot;

Her: &quot;I deserve it. I do.&quot;

[...]


So this is what my problem is. My fiance bears a lot of guilt for what has happened and she tries to carry around that burden forever. I try to tell her its normal for people to feel guilty about these things and that she isn&#x27;t the only one, that I feel guilty about things I&#x27;ve done too, but its just so hard for her to let it go. We&#x27;ve discussed seeing a counselor about it but she is scared about what the counselor will say (I&#x27;m pretty sure its a family fear, her sister is the same way about her problems) and is pretty adamant about not seeing one. While I have also recommended talking to someone, anyone else about these things, she is too embarrassed to talk to her friends about this burden because she feels it is entirely her fault (not entirely but she is usually the one to escalate) and doesn&#x27;t want her friends to think less of her.


I&#x27;m going to get a book about building good relationships and try to use a few techniques from there, but I was hoping for your collective help on this. We really do enjoy the time spent together when we are happy (which is most of the time) and I truly believe that what ever problems we&#x27;re having now be nothing in the grand scheme of things. This relationship is worth salvaging (for those wondering, we are not planning on getting married for another year or so).


Now, I&#x27;m not looking for advice about how to stop fighting or to be more effective communicators during a fight. We have tried safe words but, as described above, I am much much more likely to use the safe word than she is, so when I do, she doesn&#x27;t recognize it as legitimate. But that&#x27;s a different topic, different problem. On the plus side, though, while we may not communicate well when we are upset, something that I really value in our relationship is that we can talk to each other about absolutely anything, be it politics, personal problems, or hypothetical biologies of alien species. She&#x27;s my best friend and I want to keep it that way. So here it is, the final question.


tl;dr My fiance feels really guilty about how she has hurt me in our past fights and the embarrassment makes her want to break up with me. What strategies can we utilize so that she can start to let go of the guilt and forgive herself? What are your experiences?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I&#x27;m going to try to get all of the information out here in some sort of order, but if it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m sorry ahead of time. Throwaway cause both he and I are active on the forum.

My boyfriend, we&#x27;ll call him Frank for the post, have been together for 4 years. We have had ups and downs like any relationship, but for the past... oh, 6 months or so it&#x27;s been rocky, and for the past 2-3 days I have been seriously considering leaving (which I have never considered before).

We have a pretty good life, I work hard, we have a few dogs, a nice place to live in a part of the world that we both love (US). 

A little backstory about us - initially, our sex life was great. It was fun, and we had an active sex life. In the last year, it has dwindled down to maybe... 4 or 5 times in the last year. Literally. I have expressed to him many times, in many ways, that I want/need/would like more sex on a regular basis. He always says something like, &quot;Oh yeah me too&quot; or some other non-commital line, which I know is total bullshit. I have been chalking it up to him just being stressed out. Frank will blame it on the dogs being around, the wind <mark>blow</mark>ing the wrong direction, he&#x27;s tired... Really in all honesty I have just... given up trying. I am 99% sure he is not cheating, as I have full access to his pc, his phone, and when I am at work, Frank is home. Other than that, we&#x27;re together. The sex (or lack thereof) is only a small part of the problem. 

Frank has been unemployed for about 6 months now.  He&#x27;s finally up for a job. An important thing to note at this point: I smoke marijuana. Frank does as well. I have smoked for a long time, and never, ever, once &quot;<mark>forced</mark>&quot; Frank to smoke. He&#x27;s also smoked for many, many years (as in WAY before he knew me). We have smoked regularly since knowing each other. So - us smoking is NOT a new development.

Why am I telling you this? Well, now Frank needs to take a drug test. He hasn&#x27;t smoked in awhile, as we knew this was coming eventually. 

Also a note: I may smoke, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on it. I work a full time high stress job. I pay all my bills. I do everything I need to do. I&#x27;m not a &#x27;college stoner&#x27;. I don&#x27;t bother anyone. I smoke at home, and do not drive under the influence. I am a responsible user, who&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t use any other kind of drug. I don&#x27;t drink, nor do I smoke cigarettes. I smoke because I enjoy it, as a person would enjoy a nice cold beer or glass of wine after work.

Since the notion of the drug test has come up, Frank has turned into some person I don&#x27;t even know. He&#x27;s suddenly telling me that it puts us at risk, and how horrible it is, yadda yadda. 

Not only that, suddenly he wants me to change. Not only does he want me to quit smoking, he wants me to dress differently. He actually GOT MAD at me when I bought work clothes that weren&#x27;t &#x27;flattering&#x27;. He wants me to act differently. He doesn&#x27;t like all of these things that have been the same since the day we met. He never seems happy with me, or with himself. He&#x27;s nasty. He has called me stupid on more than a few occasions. All of this is within the last 2 months or so. 

I&#x27;ve never, ever pretended to be someone I am not. I have always been pretty honest and forthcoming about who I am, what I believe, etc. 

I am not willing to change who I am. I don&#x27;t think asking someone to change themselves for you is very healthy either. Sure, I&#x27;m not perfect... I could lose 10 lbs, I could run more, I could eat more healthy... those are the kinds of things I understand changing. 

Quite honestly - I think it&#x27;s all projection. He&#x27;s overweight now, he&#x27;s unemployed, he&#x27;s unhappy with his life. Which I understand. But how long should I be the brunt of his unhappiness?? I&#x27;ve never considered leaving before, but... last night, he was just so miserable, I didn&#x27;t even want to leave work to come home. I&#x27;m ready to give up. I work too hard to spend my free time hating life, which is what I am starting to do.

Look - I know I am not perfect. We all have issues/baggage/problems/things we need to change. I am aware of this, and willing to do what I need to do to try to help him. But I am not willing to change who I am.

And yes - I have tried talking to him... more than once about this. It just ends up as a screaming match. One time it ended with him telling me that I was so stupid that I &quot;couldn&#x27;t figure out what he needed even if he drew me a fucking map.&quot;

   
**tl;dr**: Shit has been fucked up for a year. How long do I need to keep trying to make it better?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Hello, I&#x27;m back. [Original](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35mvpp/me_28f_with_my_friend_28m_9999_sure_i_just_helped/) is here and the first [Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35rewh/update_me_28f_with_my_friend_28m_9999_sure_i/) is here. 

Theresa is back with Troy. :/

For the past day or so I haven&#x27;t contacted Theresa. She texted me once and said, &quot;Thank you for everything. I know you were just trying to help me.&quot; but I was in the middle of making crab rangoons with my SO and didn&#x27;t answer right away and then forgot about it (bad habit of mine). Then, a few hours later, her sister messaged me on fb. Her sister is married to my SO&#x27;s best friend so we&#x27;ve gotten somewhat close over the years. She said that she and Theresa had just had a huge <mark>blow</mark>-out fight because Theresa had decided to go back home to Troy and her sister adamantly opposed it. Like, said she&#x27;d lose respect for her if she went, and Theresa still went. :(

I asked her if they were still getting married and she said she didn&#x27;t know, but Theresa was still wearing her ring when she left. :/ Apparently Troy had convinced her that his greatest sin was lying about hanging out with Britney and there was no proof of cheating, and Theresa had decided she could forgive and move past mere lying. Apparently Troy had begged her and pleaded with her, and apparently unfriending Britney on Facebook was a show of good faith that he&#x27;d never contact her again. 

I asked Theresa&#x27;s sister how he explained lying about me knowing about the proposal and she said Theresa hadn&#x27;t mentioned it. She said Theresa&#x27;s mindset was, &quot;Yeah, he lied, but he also did it while ring shopping for *me,* so he still really loves me.&quot; I asked her about the condoms and her sister said that Theresa had never told her about finding condoms.  

So, they&#x27;re back together. I saw Theresa make a facebook status to the tune of, &quot;So grateful for Troy for standing by me, love conquers all&quot; or something like that. 

I feel really disappointed, but it&#x27;s her choice and I&#x27;m going to respect that. I&#x27;m not going to harass her for the decision because she has all the info in making it, there&#x27;s nothing further I can do. :/ 

My question is, what I should do from this point on?  My intuition is to cut them both off and live my life drama-free. I know that sounds heartless but I feel so emotionally drained from the past few days and I have a gut feeling that things are going to fall apart for them again and Theresa will come to either me or her sister seeking comfort (as she has **always** done in the past). We are her two main crutches when anything stresses her out. And I don&#x27;t know if I want to coach her through problems with him when I already did so much to try to prevent her from getting into that situation. It will be exhausting, and it will be hard not to say, &quot;I told you so.&quot; So my intuition is to distance myself and not involve myself anymore, but I also don&#x27;t feel entirely at ease abandoning my friend when I know she&#x27;ll probably need help in the future.

Reddit, what would you do? Should I resign myself to continue leaving my door open for her in the future, even though I&#x27;m really disappointed by her choice, or should I fade her out of my life, even though I&#x27;ll feel a little bit guilty for abandoning her even though she will probably get into worse situations? The other thing that&#x27;s influencing me to cut them both out is that I will NEVER forgive or reconcile with Troy. I have seen the face of a shitheap, and it is Troy. Even if I did forgive him, I would never trust him again, so what would be the point of being friends? But continuing to be friends with Theresa would (presumably) force me to either be around him, in contact with him, or hear about him... and what if they get married? So, I&#x27;m not really sure what to do here. Some people have suggested reaching out to Britney and getting damning proof from her, but I don&#x27;t know if I want to do that. I already feel like I&#x27;ve done a lot, and if Theresa can dismiss that stuff... :/ 

**EDIT** Oh also, Britney (who isn&#x27;t friends with my SO) started &quot;liking&quot; all of his pictures on facebook yesterday. Like dozens of his photos. I thought that was super weird because they&#x27;ve only met once. He changed his privacy settings so she can&#x27;t see his stuff anymore but I thought that was random and odd. 

PS Thank you for all the stellar support and advice, as always. I have really felt part of a community these past few days with the outpouring of kindness that I&#x27;ve received from you all. So thank you :) 

PPS You have also enlightened me to the fact that people do use condoms to masturbate, which surprised me because I always thought guys were reluctant to use them for SEX, let alone for self-pleasure! You learn something new every day. But I&#x27;m fairly sure Troy wasn&#x27;t using them for that, as you all have acknowledged. But thank you for everyone informing me about that tidbit!
 
**tl;dr**: Theresa is back with Troy. I&#x27;m torn between cutting them both out or resigning myself to being a friend and helping her again when they have trouble in the future.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2z219w/me_27_m_with_my_gf_29_f_of_5yrs_found_out_she/" target="_blank" class="title">Me [27 M] with my GF [29 F] of 5yrs, found out she cheated on a recent trip. She admitted and things got messy onward.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">My girlfriend and I had been dating for a little over 5 years. It was a big challenge to make it work. First she would travel long distance for over a year to see me. Then I moved in with her when I finished school in her town of residence. I had to move away for school for 2 years. First year long distance. Second year she moved in with me to my school city and we lived for a year. And the last year we lived together some of which was at her parents house (which were more than accomodating.)

The story: In the recent months, she said she wanted to go travel for a few months in her country of origin to see family and sight-seeing. I told her I cannot go because the timing is not good (January/Feb). I had to agree for her to go alone. I was not that worried because she had come a long way for me and done a lot to make things work. Come Febuary, I find that someone had messaged her romantic stuff on her facebook private messages and she responded and the conversation continued and I realized she had been with him for a few days at her trip. And she also exchanged romantic interest in him (via messages). I literally broke down for a few minutes. I called her and told her I found out. She was caught off-guard and in shock. At first she said it was only a kiss but I told her I know it was more and that they were going to meet later on her trip at some point. She immediately changed her FB password and deleted the messages. I was extremely angry and obviously called her awful things which I do not regret. I called her the next morning and asked for details of the encounter in which she was <mark>forced</mark> to give explicit details. She was not defensive about her actions. In the end she had not slept with him (or yet). I asked for her FB password again and she gave it to me.

She later contacted her sister (via FB) about this issue and her sister told her hold still and give me time to cool off. She admitted to her sister that she was ashamed but not that regretful of what had happened because she had been bored recently. She was interested in the guy. Her sister (we do not get along all that well) told her to re-evaluate your relationship and continue your trip. It really pissed me off to find out she was not held accountable by her sister despite the support. I felt that she might decide to dump me while on her trip and that would be double the <mark>blow</mark> to me. So I talked to her a few more times more gently and explained to her what she is doing to our relationship. I told her to keep it between us. She admitted she fucked up but that she could not come back right away because it would raise suspicions amongst her family. 

Anyway for the next little while it appeared that she continued to go out and spend time with her family and post pictures online. I was furious that she is the one who screwed up but made very little effort to comfort me. I told to stop contacting me until she comes. And even then she made zero contact. Not even an email to see if I am ok. 

I was miserable. I told my family. They told me to break up right away. They were all shocked because she had been an amazing partner these years. I ended up telling her parents what happened before taking some of my stuff from their house and that I owed it to them since I was going to ask her to marry me soon. They were puzzled why I was telling them but said you should wait and talk with her when she comes back. 

She was last week told by her dad that I am leaving her but instead of confirming with me she got mad and decided to spend a couple more times with the guy she had originally. I assume she realized she had nothing left for her when she comes back. And that she still liked him.

She is back now and we have talked about sorting out our common things but I decided to talk to get some closure on what happened and she admitted that for the past 6 months I had completely abandoned her and did nothing but work and showed her very little attention. She admitted that she did not want to break up before or go on this trip to get away but that she just happened to meet someone who was nice to her for the moment. That she was frustrated. I told her you should have seriously sat down and told me what was wrong before and not act like a coward and go do your thing.

We spoke again for hours and she admitted that she did not sleep with him (I care to believe her because she has a hard time lying to my face and she gave me details of her encounter when asked). She does not seem to ask for a second chance and has accepted my break-up. I asked her if she even wants to go back and she said that she needs to be alone to figure out what she wants in life and that she has spent the past couple of years accomodating to my goals and not hers. She has made it clear that she does want to go back to our ways. Of course my issues are much bigger. I don&#x27;t trust her right now. I don&#x27;t know if I could later because I am worried that we rebuild everything from scratch knowing what everyone wants but that she will tire again and go her own way. She cannot communicate her main issues with me. She always had this problem. And I feel that I am being weak even asking if she wants to work things out. That she betrayed me but somehow I do not want to let go. Maybe because she has done so much for me that I know what she is capable of as a partner. 

She seems like she has reached her patience. She had been selfish in the recent months and when I tried to find out what is wrong I was not made clear of serious that bothered her. She is also furious that I had been checking on her while I told her I do not want contact. I had picked through her phone a while back before her trip also because I realized she was texting with a guy who she had a brief history with before meeting me. Although she did not lead him on. Apparently she knew but did not say anything because she had nothing to hide.

The reality is logically I should move on. She screwed up and that is not justifiable. She realizes that her dissatisfaction with us does not justify her action. We come from different cultures and families. While my family sees cheating as an extreme taboo I know her family has had encounters like this before and that her parents have worked things out when they were young. I am certain she has been influenced by people around her. She also admitted to me early in our relationship that she had been meaning to break up with her long-term ex-boyfriend who was up to no good for a year but that at the time that we met she was not officially single. She said she knew he had cheated on her at some point but decided to live with him. So these things seem to be more common to her.

In fact I draw very similar parallels between how we met and how she met this guy. She has had bad influence in her life. I am very very different and better than her previous relationships and even the type of people her siblings dates. In a way I stand out from their usual crowd. She seemed so ambitious to continue school and start her career like me but I feel that maybe she was doing all this for me and that at some point she realized she is losing herself. She also seems to require a lot of attention. 

Even if I can live with the fact that she betrayed me (did not sleep with someone), I feel that she does not have it in her to face life challenges. I am much more weathered for instability due to my life course. I told her what I want in my life and what my plans are for the next few years and see if she sees herself being to fulfill her goals alongside me. The problem is I feel that I am giving in and she will walk all over me later because I tolerated this kind of action. And that she will not have it in her to gain my trust or that of my family. 

Almost everyone tells me to break up and that I deserve better but I can&#x27;t fully let go. 

To this day I am still more caring for us than myself but she does not seem to be like that. Do I break up immediately? Do I give us time to clear our heads? 
   
**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

Girlfriend cheated. Not slept with the guy. Our families know. She is ok with me breaking up. I am confused to give second chance to sort our original problem or not? She is not sure if she wants to go back.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Long post ahead. Tldr at bottom.

My girlfriend had had a pretty shitty upbringing. For as long as she remembers, she&#x27;s always wanted to be accepted and shown &#x27;open arms&#x27; from her family, but knowing that would never be the case. 

My girlfriend is a sweet, goofy and weird girl, aspects which I find endearing. She hasn&#x27;t always related well to people and has had a hard time with bullying, bad parents and an overwhelming <mark>forced</mark> childhood that left her traumatized. She had to grow up too fast and deal with too much.

Her father is a narcissistic, womanizing type A personality who&#x27;s too wrapped up in the glory days to actually have been an attentive father. He&#x27;s always wrapped up in his youthful days and going on about his problems that he never was really there for my girlfriend. She has told me that he was verbally abusive and an alcoholic back when she was young, forcing her to grow up fast to deal with the issues at hand.

He is highly emotional powder keg that can go off if the slightest thing goes wrong or if he&#x27;s under some amount of stress. He cost both her and her brother their college funds and <mark>blow</mark>ing it on lavish gifts for himself at a dark time in her life. She has been struggling to go to college for years, but this imo, was a huge set back in that happening, forcing her to work retail jobs just to pay bills.

Her mother is from Latin American country and is considered a black sheep of the family so to speak, mainly for her evangelicalism. She&#x27;s a nice lady, but can be an airhead and aloof. She has had numerous failed marriages to assholes and has had trouble supporting herself on her own, this staying in bad situations out of fear of not being able to support her kids.

Her immediate family are all successful in their own rigt, but are all estranged with her, bringing up petty issues and being down right nasty to my girlfriends mom, and an extension, her. They caused her a great amount of depression and stress when she tried to live with several of them over the years (the mindset, &quot;sins of the father carried onto the son&quot; comes to mind). 

So because of such a traumatic upbringing, my girlfriend has become jaded and almost resentful in my eyes (much to her dismissal of it). All she has sought, much into her adult life is a family that would accept her for who she is an with 100% open arms. 

Now my family is accepting, but it takes time to get to know someone before trust and acceptance follow. They always were welcoming and offered trips to the beach, and my immediate family was warm, open and down right loving but she remained distant and kind of hid in the corner, afraid of being judged by them.

I learned that my folks weren&#x27;t exactly keen on her, because before out first separation (communication issues) I was putting all the effort in, and becoming depressed and emotionally drained myself, which had them worried. They didn&#x27;t see her as exactly a positive influence. 

Somehow she had a feeling that my folks weren&#x27;t exactly understanding (especially with how they barely knew her an only got information from my side.) so she feels my family can never fill that void and how she&#x27;s alone. 

Now she&#x27;s back at college and working her ass off, albeit she&#x27;s living with her dad, but a lesser of two evils atm. She&#x27;s spoken to me, saying how she doesn&#x27;t understand how she can see a mom or dad helping their kid set up a display for a presentation, or how she sees couples on campus supporting one another and how we can&#x27;t have that, that she feels a disconnect etc.

Everything feels foreign to her and I see it as her being longing and resentful of her shitty childhood and being cheated out. She says she technically should be in a job atm and working in her field, but she&#x27;s just getting to college now in life and feels behind. 

The one good thing that did come from this was that she joined a Native American society on campus and is learning a lot about them. She found a connection of some sort with then (spiritual?) and says that they had opened up their arms to her. It&#x27;s a step imo, but in the long term scale of things, i don&#x27;t know how this will play out.

I feel powerless to actually help. She&#x27;s made a big turnaround from whee see was (depression, negativity etc) with medication, feeling like she&#x27;s progressing and some form of therapy every now and then, yet these might be deeper issues than I can offer answers for. I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss.

TL:DR - GF shitty upbringing left longing for (a) family to openly accept her, having trouble trying to relate and find a way to help come to an understanding.

            <div class="content collapsed">The story begins at the end of May, and I am going to tell every little gritty detail, I want it out there. As many people are aware, Tinder is a dating app with simple mechanics, if you find someone attractive, swipe right, and left if you think the person is unattractive. The premise of this app is vain, but as most people do, I downloaded the app because all my friends had done so. I fooled around with it, even met a few girls but all we did was kiss. At this point in my life I want a relationship, and using Tinder didn&#x27;t seem like a likely source for this outcome.

Then I met a girl, I will call her KLK. She is 19 and I am 22, but that little of an age difference wouldn&#x27;t stop me from dating someone. The first time I saw her, embraced her, I felt close, and she was so beautiful. We went back to my place and watched Superbad, ate popcorn, talked and got to know each other. Then later on we watched Braveheart, halfway through we started to make out, as things carried on we moved to my bedroom and I informed her I wanted to wait to have sex because like I said, I want to build a meaningful relationship, as did she.

I took her home the next morning after we cuddled and kissed all night and for the first time in my life I felt genuinely happy about life. Ever since I can remember I&#x27;ve wanted to feel love, but I&#x27;ve always been a shy person but I&#x27;m getting better. She was a ray of sunshine.

We continued to hangout over the next few weeks, talking everyday and I was falling for her, and falling for hard. She met my friends, and every single one of my friends adored her, as did I. As we hung out more I felt more comfortable to the idea of having sex, so as I became more advancing she remained steady with not having sex yet. She had talked to me about her prior boyfriend a little bit and out of curiosity after we had just fooled around, laying in my bed, I asked her why her relationship with her last boyfriend didn&#x27;t last. But before I get to that, I want to talk about KLK&#x27;s past before I talk about her ex (she told me everything about her past, I was curious).

KLK went to a mostly black school growing up, being white she was the odd one out. My close friends are all white, as am I, and through prior experiences they may be a little prejudiced towards blacks. I have been influenced a little by their prejudice but I am not racist. KLK had sex with several people at an almost all black school, she informed me. Her first time having sex was with someone she considered to be a real close friend, and after they had sex her &#x27;friend&#x27; practically abandoned her, and after this she said she went on kind of a &#x27;spree&#x27;. She told me she has had sex with a total of 9 people, so I would assume she probably had sex with 4-5 people during high school, which to me seems somewhat of a high number, and being an odd one out at a high school I could see her getting some sort of a reputation, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong, and even if so that wouldn&#x27;t stop me pursuing her.

KLK then went on to tell me about her first boyfriend, she said he was emotionally abusive to her, that he would make her feel like she was worthless and that his reasoning for doing this was that he was &#x27;preparing her for the real world&#x27;. She had previously told me after we got done fooling around (aka me receiving a <mark>blow</mark> job after I fingered her) that she was a loud moaner (she is) and that she had actually gotten called out for it by her boyfriends father. Case in point, the emotionally abusive boyfriend.
So after fooling around a little in high school and having an emotionally abusive boyfriend, KLK moved away, got another boyfriend who lived a few hours away from the college she chose to go to. For the first time, she wasn&#x27;t the odd one out at her school, white was the majority; something she wasn&#x27;t used to. She lived in a dorm on campus with co-ed bathrooms, which she said wasn&#x27;t a big deal, and I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t but I can imagine things being pretty weird. When she told me she had sex with 9 people total she said that some were in high school, some in college, so I am unsure if she cheated on her previous boyfriend as she was dating him during her time at her college, but that remains a mystery.

Before this next part, I have to say that I believe KLK is a genuinely nice person, maybe too nice and people take advantage of her kindness sometimes. She has girl and guy friends, and as any guy knows, guy friends normally aren&#x27;t just &#x27;friends&#x27;. But I digress...so I asked her why she and her last boyfriend broke up after she refused to have sex again, and she started to tear up and began to cry a little as she told me her story. Since I&#x27;ve already told everything I know about her past, I&#x27;ll get back to the present.
KLK&#x27;s last boyfriend gave her HSV-2, or in other words, genital herpes. I was shocked, almost speechless. She said she wasn&#x27;t sure if he fooled around on her and got herpes, or if he had it the whole time they were together. She found out in November of 2013, but stayed with her ex boyfriend until February of 2014 when her ex boyfriend, who was 20, dumped KLK for a girl still in high school. As she lay holding back tears, I laid next to her in disbelief. I have never had a girlfriend, didn&#x27;t have sex literally until a few months before I even met KLK. I had a few chances but never took the risk, or was too shy to actually proceed having sex. Then I meet KLK, who seemed so perfect, then she laid all of this info on me. I felt many emotions, sadness, anger at the fact that she was so careless, I felt like she wasn&#x27;t waiting for love, she was just fucking around and eventually got herpes from it. I didn&#x27;t believe her story, I mean why should I after she lied to me about having herpes to me up to this point? Maybe she got herpes from someone other than her boyfriend, I second guessed everything.

She told me she is on antiviral medicine for the herpes and takes good care of it so that she controls her outbreaks. But what she was ignorant of was that you only need to make skin to skin contact to transfer herpes. Eventually I began to believe her story, but I stopped seeing her for a week, I tried to get tested for herpes but I didn&#x27;t have any symptoms so the place I went to didn&#x27;t do the right test I needed, but after speaking to a doctor about everything we did together, the chances of me contracting herpes was slim to none...and as of today, over a month since we had any skin to skin contact, I am symptom free.

As time past, and after I educated myself about herpes, I felt that if I loved someone, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about taking the risk. We&#x27;re both so young though, and the chances of us staying together are very little. I am aware of the fact that we both will go through a lot of changes between the ages 20-30; and she hasn&#x27;t even really begun college yet. I felt angry that she risked me getting herpes because she didn&#x27;t tell me she had it, but I can understand why you&#x27;d want to wait before telling someone that, as long as you refrained from intercourse, of course. She had told me since her ex she had gone on a few dates but only kissed a few, and the last guy she met before me she ended up telling on the first date she had herpes and he stopped talking to her, so she was afraid to tell me.

I felt betrayed by her. I have trust issues and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could ever trust her again. After a week or so after she informed me that she had herpes we met, and I was mad at her, I let her know how I felt and how hurt I was by what she had done to me. If she possibly gave herpes to me, even knowing that she had herpes, then that would be even worse than what her boyfriend apparently did to her, because at least he didn&#x27;t know. I told her that if she wanted she could talk to other guys, because I wasn&#x27;t sure where our relationship would go...although I selfishly said if she did talk to other guys I wouldn&#x27;t be happy...it would just be another reason why I shouldn&#x27;t be with her. I tried to force her out of my life, started to talk to other girls and eventually had sex with a girl on a few occasions. When I was with the other girl, and after I had sex with the girl, I felt empty, nothingness. Not like how I felt when I was with KLK.

We began hanging out again and as I began to feel more comfortable with her, I was ready to risk having sex with her. I asked her how to put a condom on after we fooled around a little, I&#x27;d only put one on a few times just experimenting. After I got it on I tried to have sex and she still said no, that she wanted to wait until she was in love to have sex. After she refused, I felt like I was worthless, that I wasn&#x27;t good enough, that all the guys she had sex with before were, and that I wasn&#x27;t. That thought deteriorated at my mind to the point of me having nightmares. I was losing my mind, thinking she had been talking to other guys besides me.

I began hanging out with her more and eventually accepted the realization that the reason KLK wanted to wait to have sex is because herpes is serious, and for the person she&#x27;s with to risk it, and for herself also, she wants to be in love with that person, and I respect her for that...and honestly feel selfish for thinking otherwise.

Eventually one night I saw KLK receive a text from a guy saying &#x27;Goodnight. :)&#x27;. Again in the morning she received more texts from guys wishing her good morning. I confronted her on it. She said they were just &#x27;guy friends&#x27; and I informed every reason why they weren&#x27;t just &#x27;guy friends&#x27; and she said that it wasn&#x27;t like she could just get them to stop texting her, and besides we weren&#x27;t boyfriend and girlfriend. She said if we were, then she wouldn&#x27;t be texting them. She also said that she talks about me to them, so they know that she wasn&#x27;t interested in them.

I really believe that she is a nice girl, and that she wouldn&#x27;t ever cheat on me if we were together, but this isn&#x27;t something that I wanted to see while making a decision on if I wanted to be with her. That and the fact that she has herpes, and lied to me about having herpes. I just couldn&#x27;t risk it, and I hate myself because I love her. I told her that I don&#x27;t think we will work out.
She really hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong, if her story holds up, which I could believe it does, she just got unlucky contracting herpes. The one thing I believe she lied about was when she said she used protection with every person she has had sex with except for her ex boyfriend. It just seems unlikely, and maybe even more unlikely that the one person she chooses not to use protection with gives her herpes? Just not so sure, and she told me not to tell anyone, but I did talk to my best friend, along with strangers on the internet. Everyone has told me to leave her.

The last part of my story with her I didn&#x27;t want to put on here, it was a nightmare. So...last week I decided I would make a decision, after a little over a month of educating and debating, and trying to force myself to not have feelings for her, after all the gut wrenching feelings I had and tears I shed, I thought I was ready. We met at a Starbucks, and I planned on telling her that at this point in my life I didn&#x27;t think I was ready to take the risk of being with her...

Then when she got there and I looked into her eyes, I couldn&#x27;t tell her, I changed my decision...I wasn&#x27;t strong minded enough. We hung out that day like everything was okay, I cuddled her to sleep after we chilled on a mountain top and talked. Next morning I realize she left her phone in my car, so I charge it and see how I can get ahold of her, again I notice she has several texts from other guys, but at this point I was okay with that. The one thing I wasn&#x27;t okay with is that I still wasn&#x27;t sure if I am making the correct decision. My best friend has been VERY adamant that I do not stay with her, telling him may have been a mistake but me and him are like blood, I would take a bullet for him and he the same...so when I was faced with this I had no one else to talk to. He&#x27;s trustworthy with the information, but he has been a major factor thus far in my reasoning with what to do with her.

I finally used Facebook to get ahold of her the next day, and we planned to meet at her parents house. I was going to give her phone back and tell her everything then, and hopefully this time be able to choke back the tears and have a mature conversation with her. So I get to her house, and knock on the door. She tells me to come in. The next part is the nightmare, my nightmare, my torture for being so indecisive and being so inexperienced with relationships and love. I come in, and she&#x27;s making brownies for me, her parents and teenage brothers are all together making dinner and they invite me to stay. I can&#x27;t think straight, so I made up a lie to go out to my car and recuperate. I call my best friend who tells me that if I&#x27;m breaking things off, not to do it tonight or else her father may kill me. So for the next 3 hours I was there I pretended like everything was okay, and the next day I left for vacation...so I had to tell her over text that I wanted to break things off. I told her I didn&#x27;t deserve to meet her parents or her brownies, and she assured me that her parents like me...and that she wanted me to eat her brownies.

The first thing I did when I got back from a vacation filled with thinking about her the majority of the time and drinking my poor excuse for a human mind into oblivion, was eat her brownies. I&#x27;m meeting with her again two days from now to have the talk I wanted to have at Starbucks...we&#x27;re meeting somewhere else this time.

Make fun of me and critique me for the way I handled everything, I know it was all wrong. I really am an idiot. I wrote this poem for her because I write poems when I feel really sad, so I might as well share it on here.

Nothing taste like it did before

Is it a mistake to let you walk out that door?

A summer of bittersweet memories

The changing of seasons

What will they present for me?

You etched your initials on my heart

I will never forget you because we&#x27;re never apart

Enter this house of yours again

Enter the dream world with you I am

Awoken to the truth of reality

That you and I may never be

But fate has a way of turning the tables

And if our paths cross again someday

I promise you that I would stay

ALSO: I pursued other girls out of anger and resentment toward her. The fact that she risked me getting herpes for all that time we fooled around, I just felt like she didn&#x27;t even care. I am so nice to her, but she was so afraid that I would leave. It was a careless move on her part...and I knew the risk of falling in love with her. So I literally <mark>forced</mark> myself to be with another girl, and I haven&#x27;t felt so vacant since my father died. I literally felt nothing with the other girl. All I feel now is sorrow...I prayed to god for the correct answer, and I don&#x27;t even believe in religion. I&#x27;m so at loss...I just wanted the chance to love her without any restriction. I told her that I wish I met her before she had this happen to her...and she said she wish I had too.


TL;DR Girl I may potential love has herpes...her past is questionable and my trust is hard to get. My feelings for her are strong, I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s infatuation or the beginning of love.

            <div class="content collapsed">tl;dr: My ex boyfriend is highly dependent on marijuana... We&#x27;ve already broken up twice, but I really love and miss him - would it be a mistake to get back together? What is the best way to deal with a SO that is addicted to something?

I adore my ex and he adores me. We clicked the day we met. We both come across as attractive, calm, laid-back individuals and our lifestyles are compatible with one exception: he smokes a LOT of marijuana. Now, normally this wouldn&#x27;t bother me too much, but it gets in the way of his daily activities. He literally cannot function because of it, but he can&#x27;t function without it. He wants to cut down (he knows it&#x27;s bad and wants to become more religious...we are both Muslim), but is struggling. He loves weed... He will <mark>blow</mark> me off just to smoke with his friends and always has me waiting for him. He stopped drinking completely (I didn&#x27;t ask him - he decided on it himself), but really hasn&#x27;t been able to reduce his smoking. I hope he can change for his own sake, and not try to force it because he wants to keep me in his life. My father was an alcoholic, so I know from experience that addicts can only change of their own accord. I just don&#x27;t want to waste my time or damage myself or him... 

So. What is the best solution? Am I enabling him by staying with him? If I leave him completely, am I abandoning him and making his bad influence friends his only options for people to hang out with? All the guilt... &gt;.&lt;</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Hi guys,

I&#x27;m 37 and my partner is 35. 

I met my girlfriend nearly 4 years ago, on the back of the breakdown of my previous marriage. It started as visits and chatting, but very quickly changed to stopping over (on the sofa) for the weekend. 

We had been childhood friends for about 7 years, but I left to join the forces, and 17 years passed before we got in touch again. (All of my friends were aware that my ex-wife was cheating on me, but none of them had told me - left me with very little, and she was there).

Over the 17 years we had been out of touch, she had developed a heroin + crack habit, had been a prostitute for 7 years, but had become clean about 2 years before we got in touch. Over that period, she has had a serious amount of problems (as you can imagine), resulting in depression, collapsed veins, abcesses (now healed, but scarred), and alchoholism, along with severe self-image issues - a lot of this stems from abuse as a child. 

Her previous partner (whom she had split up with some time prior to us getting back together) was exceedingly jealous of the way we got on, and ended up creating profiles of her on dating sites, talking to random guys, and sending them photos of her naked - taken when she was nodding. 

Through a series of unlikely events, I ended up finding this out (browsing history + a couple of suspicious comments) and once i presented her with the evidence, she broke down - exceedingly hurt.

Not long after this, we kissed whilst <mark>drunk</mark>, it ended up with us in bed, and we decided to make a go of it. I was living about 150 miles away, and travelled up at weekends and 2 x during the week.

Sadly, her alchohol abuse got the better of her, and she ended up in hospital with pancreatitis (this happened multiple times during our relationship). We carried on with our relationship, and all was relatively smooth - arguments caused massive mood swings for me though, and when she was ill, her weight loss took her down to 45Kg, which was frankly unattractive. 

In any case, she managed to become pregnant (a miracle by any standards), and kicked the drink very early on (before the 2nd month, whilst in hospital for pancreatitis).

I left the forces and moved in about 3 months after our daughter was born (all normal no FAS, a beautiful girl), and things were pretty rosey. Our sex life - which had been fantastic, started to suffer after the birth, but I put it down to hormones, meds and lack of sleep.

About 6 months ago, she discovered some porn on my phone (normal porn, nothing exotic) which i had downloaded about 4 weeks before she had given birth, and went utterly mad. Her opinions on porn are very strong, and influenced by her time working - all women are exploited etc etc. This caused a gap in our relationship, the sex life suffered even more - she says that all she can see when we try to be intimate is the porn i was watching whilst she was in the final stages of pregnancy.

This got even worse recently - she discovered porn on my PC (homemade that me and my ex-wife had made about 7 years ago, plus some photos of my ex-wife naked taken about 3 weeks before I got together with my GF, and an impressive library of images downloaded back when it was worth downloading pictures rather than film). I had thought that I&#x27;d deleted them when we got together, but it appears they were backed up without me realising :(

The result of this one has been catastrophic - I was told to move out, spent some time at my dads then moved back home, back to the sofa. We seemed to be getting back on track - discussed counselling for us, (both couple and sexual - I&#x27;ve been suffering from ED for some time), however she seems to be unable to let it go. Uses every oppertunity to use it as a weapon. During the arguments over the photos, she took every oppertunity to say that I&#x27;d never satisfied her, that she&#x27;d never come, and that she had cheated on me (later denied it - and i believe her)

The latest attack is that I took the photos of my ex-wife when she was asleep (I&#x27;ve not seen the photos since they were taken, but apparantly there 2 of her face asleep, then a few of her body under the covers).

I honestly can&#x27;t even remember taking the photos other than vaguely, it was a trophy thing. Obivously with her prior experience of photos taken when out of it, she&#x27;s really taken it badly, and decided that trying to work on being a couple is worthless, and to just concentrate on being parents. No mention of moving out, but its back to the sofa again.

I really don&#x27;t know what to do. We are living separate lives in the same house, I love her with everything in me, I believe we can make a go of it. I&#x27;ve visited a doctor about the ED, and was in the process of arranging counselling when the latest <mark>blow</mark>-up happened.

I really am lost at sea. She is taking no meds, is constantly tired, and in pain from the veins. I know that at least some of it is taking it out on me, and am happy to accept that. Its her lack of willingness to move on thats the problem - shes treating the photo sets like they were taken today, rather than years ago.

Help?

tl;dr - Gf is a childhood friend that I got back in touch with. Has a host of issues, including prior heroin/crack/alchohol addictions. We have a child. The discovery of old homemade porn has caused a fissure, now we are strangers in the same house.</div>

**TL;DR: clicked on a soft-core image in front of her, &#x27;didn&#x27;t close it fast enough&#x27;, feel frustrated/stuck.**

26 Male, fiancee is 25 Female. Been together off and on for 4 years, engaged 1, wedding this summer. Been kinda planning a more in depth post, but for now, since we&#x27;re mid-fight, I just want to address what&#x27;s goin on with that.

Right now we&#x27;re in a state of not talking to each other (I know that won&#x27;t last, she&#x27;ll force a conversation later today, which is better than not), after not <mark>sleeping</mark> together last night. We live in a 2 bed / 2 bath apartment with a roommate/friend, and sleep in the same bed every night. 

On to the cause: She had a pretty crappy day at work yesterday (stressful day and bad coworker interaction) so I tried to make her night more relaxing, let her take a shower, made dinner (as I usually do) and generally just tried to be a relaxing influences on her life (again, as I usually do). So there we are, toward the end of the night, after watching some netflix, beginning to poke around on reddit before getting ready for bed. I click on [this link (NSFW-ish)] (http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/qdq19/itap_of_girl_on_my_floor/) on my frontpage. My brain doesn&#x27;t put the thumbnail together, so when it comes up I say: &quot;Whoops, that&#x27;s not what I expected&quot; and fumble for the back arrow to move on.

I hope you see it coming by now, but this is when shit starts to <mark>blow</mark> up. She starts to get really, really upset, accusing me of deliberately clicking a soft-core pic, and then not backing out of it fast enough. We&#x27;ve had discussions about how she feels about other women (friends, pics, porn) before, and more or less, she expects me to not be aware of them.

Anyway, I clam up, half because that&#x27;s one of my natural reactions and half because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s an issue at all and don&#x27;t really want to validate her response to it. She withdraws to the bedroom and starts her usual brooding, and I come in to bed after a few minutes. We lay there silently for a couple minutes until she says a few lines like: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you did...&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m really angry you...&quot; and then gets up and sleeps on the couch.

What am I doing wrong, here? I feel caught in a catch-22; if I apologize, or try to talk to her about it, I feel like I&#x27;m validating this behavior, but if I leave it alone she&#x27;ll <mark>blow</mark> it even further out of proportion because she feels like I&#x27;m ignoring her. Any replies are welcome and appreciated, but even just writing this out helps make it a little clearer.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the replies :) I&#x27;m usually a pretty independently thinking guy, but there&#x27;s a bit of co-dependence going on in our relationship. Will look into the couple&#x27;s therapy.

I should have stated it up top, but I honestly don&#x27;t think about it all that much anymore, she&#x27;s bi-polar, on meds, and I&#x27;ve been around long enough to see different treatments/no treatment.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I’m 20M and my girlfriend is 21F. We’ve been in a relationship for almost four years, and we’ve known each other for around six or seven years in total. This isn’t something casual. We’ve grown a lot together, and we both see a future in this.

The one thing I keep thinking about lately is how we’ll raise kids, if we end up getting married and starting a family.

I’m an atheist. I don’t believe in any religion or higher power at all. My girlfriend is Christian. She’s not overly religious, she doesn’t go to church every single week or anything like that, but she still believes in God and considers her faith important.

Right now, our different beliefs haven’t caused any major issues. We respect each other’s views, and we’ve talked about it enough to understand where we both stand. We’re very compatible, and things are going well.

But when I think about raising kids, I get a bit worried. I don’t want to raise my kids with religion. I don’t want to force atheism either. I just want them to grow up with a neutral space, and then decide for themselves when they’re older. I want them to actually understand what belief and religion mean before they commit to anything.

She, on the other hand, feels we should take them to church when they’re young, just like most people are raised, and if they change their mind later, that’s their choice. But to me, even early exposure shapes the way a person sees the world. I’ve seen how religion can influence people’s thinking in ways that seem limiting or irrational, and I personally wouldn’t want my children to be guided by that from the start.

We’ve discussed this a few times, but it always ends in a kind of “let’s see when we get there” way. Still, it’s something I think we’ll eventually need to face head-on. I don’t want this to become a serious conflict later down the line.

So if anyone has been in a long-term relationship where you and your partner had different beliefs, especially when it came to raising kids, how did you handle it? Were you able to compromise, or did it cause bigger problems later?

I’d really appreciate any advice from both religious and non-religious people. I’m not trying to criticize anyone’s beliefs. I just want to figure out how to move forward in a way that doesn’t <mark>blow</mark> up years from now.

Thanks in advance.

            <div class="content collapsed">My (30M) girlfriend (25F) and I have been together for almost 5 years. 

Earlier this year I think I jinxed our relationship. She is a college student and I am a successful content creator, investor and now multiple business owner who works from home. We moved from our hometown where we met to a city 4 hours away for her to go to college. I didn&#x27;t do my best to make my own independent life there, she was my life. At one point for a few years I got a job but then my content started being successful and I made enough to open multiple businesses that are doing more than well enough to individually support me each, and invest money which has done very well, and it no longer made sense to stay at that job which put me back 24/7 in the house on my phone and computer with no friends or family in this city, never even really having tried to build the kind of social network I was deeply involved in in my hometown, through which I met my gf, and which I learned a year before meeting her that i absokutely NEEDED to be able to be mentally healthy especially while pursuing my dream which is me sitting in front of a computer for hours and hours shut in on end. Crazy how quickly I forgot once I fell in love.

 Essentially, I am now for the first time in my life doing very well financially. When we first met I was about to get a massive (but temporary) opportunity AND my content creation career was hitting its first profitable period after 2 years of grinding. So the first year or 2 I was doing better financially than I ever had, enough to not worry about bills and getting whatever at the grocery store or even going clothing shopping, but not super mega buy a house rich. Somewhere in the low 6 figures is probably what I brought in but compared to what I had had before it felt like I was the richest person ever. 

She never cared. The name dropping that I was a minor eceleb didn&#x27;t matter at all to her, the money wasn&#x27;t a factor because I had less than none when we first stsrted dating. At first she would let me use her car or simply spend the whole day driving around with me for the business opportunity I mentioned that came up early in our relationship and on top of the content starting to take off really took me to that place where I &quot;felt&quot; like I was set for life. Truly I was nowhere near it and I had to learn the hard way. 

But the pandemic started. She was 20 and I was 25 turning 26 right when it hit our country. She had never lived anywhere but with her parents and we were SO SO SO SOOOO deeply in limmerance at the start that when they tried to forbid her going out, and I suddenly could afford to leave where I was living (with my ex girlfriend, neither of us could afford to leave, who despite us living separately in the same place, turning the living room into her bedroom, totally closed off from the rest of the apartment, for several months and me telling her when I met my girlfriend that I had strong feelings for some girl and I would be attempting to pursue her with her at first being totally chill and not caring about it, suddenly when my girlfriend and I got together, was MADLY INSATIABLY in love with me as if for the first time and could not live without me, but that&#x27;s a whole other story. As soon as I was going to be fully gone for real she wanted to be back together and with a &quot;nobody else could ever love you, not if they really knew you, you&#x27;re really hard to deal with. Nobody else could ever love you, im the only one that&#x27;ll put up with you&quot; absolutely fucking obliterating my self esteem and carving some deepset insecurities into my chest on the way out, I still left) was not sustainable and I was trying to leave anyway. So around 3 months into being official, 4 months into consistent dating, 6 or 7 months into the massive, life stopping, hair tearing, nonstop obsessive, panic attack inducing drama that was our early attempts at dating, or rather her hot and cold acceptance then incomprehensible sudden rejection and seeming disdain, back and forth, until we had a month apart where I worked on myself and then she reached out to me saying I had looked good the first night she saw me for a second, and if she could come to concert I was going to, we moved in together. 


It is assuredly too soon. And it was horrible at first. The torrent of love flooding over us without any illusion nor notion of us having any choice or influence over the matter that had made every day like the strongest drug in the universe, where nothing else could matter but spending time together (so no more of those friends we had, no more of that work I&#x27;d been doing for 2 years only to have JUST stsrtrd seeing success from my &#x27;dream&#x27;, no more of her friends either, nor hobbies), quickly was replaced with total meltdowns locking herself in the bathroom. Abject misery. But it wasn&#x27;t all at once. She really tried to mold hersellf into the good, beautiful baby girl she thought I wanted and I never told her I did. I didn&#x27;t realize until later I suppose. 


But it&#x27;s ok. Eventually we left to the city her college would be in. I lived off the money I made from the good venture and investing it until it was gone. Then I had to get a job. Then she had to get a job because she couldn&#x27;t go to school until the following year anyway, she was not accepted yet. For a time we grinded to pay our bills and we&#x27;re almost always late, always borrowing from family hers had all but cut her off, especially her mother, for leaving to live with me. It was hard, and we fought more and more. The isolation of the pandemic really messed us up and getting jobs finally let us see how deeply we had been affected. We almost broke up at one point but she didn&#x27;t follow through for fear that I&#x27;d hurt myself. I wasn&#x27;t sure I wouldn&#x27;t, but not because of her, my mental health just really was that bad at the time. It took a year for me to realize and apologize to her and really sit her down and say &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry I even have to say this, it was so horrible that you had to think this, but if we broke up I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT kms&quot;. I didn&#x27;t even realize that&#x27;s where we had gotten mentally. At one point, 2 or so years in, she shouted &quot;why would you want to be with someone who doesn&#x27;t want to be with you?!&quot; 


But we had our ups and down. Little problems around the house but they would get better, then worse. Never any cheating, not even a hint. I literally actually went to get my testosterone levels checked because I have not felt a hint of attraction to another woman in 5 years. Turns out they&#x27;re fine, on the higher end actually, but I&#x27;ve been working out, eating well, <mark>sleeping</mark> better, treating myself right for the past 2 months.


So yes, this past year. 2024.


At the beginning of 2023 I realized I couldn&#x27;t keep just grinding it out for the rest of my 20s at the decently high paying restaurant I worked at. I needed to return to my dream that I&#x27;d given up for short term business opportunities, getting into the stock market when it was booming and everyone was a genius for buying literally any stock in the spring/summer of 2020, and of course, overwhelming uncontrollable maddening love. I went part time to go back to my dream.


And by around September or October, it had paid off. I was making money and finding success from my passion again, after starting literally all over from scratch after a 3 year leave, partly because I grew to hate how much work it was and how deeply into the business side I got and lost the love of the art. 

I had so much extra money I ended up investing in a friend&#x27;s startup which involved us going around the country to conventions to try and sell his product. 

On the 1st of these trips, I went to the city my brother lived in in January 2024. I only got a 1 hour window to go see him between all the work we were doing, but see him I did. I got to meet his first serious girlfriend who he had been with for almost 3 years now, and his stepson! Super cool, and they invited me to come back a week later, an offer which I happily took up!

Let&#x27;s put a pin in that and come back to it later. It&#x27;s important. 

Anyway, now I&#x27;m working mostly from home, only 1 or 2 days a week at the restaurant, Eventually 1, then 1 every 2 weeks as conventions and work from home took up all my time. But they loved me and tried so hard to accommodate me so I wouldn&#x27;t fully quit.

We took a monthlong trip in March to Europe and oh my GOD the romance, the spark, was back like never before. At home we had been having intimacy problems but there wasn&#x27;t a single hint of them in those Airbnbs and hotel rooms. If only it had persisted when we returned to a place we were citizens and not on travelers&#x27; visas.


Eventually though it was time to leave the job.  In May I broke my foot, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to work for 2-3 months. With that I put in my final two week notice, just a formality since I literally couldn&#x27;t work, and it was fully at home for the summer.

Her program in school became extremely extremely demanding, more than a full time job. Physical labor every day alongside regular classes, moreso a job than a degree at this point. Summer came and we were both at home but my foot was broken, I wasn&#x27;t working in a restaurant nor going to the gym (used to be very jacked, stopped with ex girlfriend, went back the year we were living together broken up, right before I met my current gf, then stopped again for a few years, picked it back up in2023 and hurt myself, did physical therapy and tried again only to break my foot), getting fat, eating like crap, not going outside, 16+ hours of screen time a day pretty much the whole day.


I was a mess. Financially insanely well off suddenly, but it didn&#x27;t look healthy. It was a ton of phone and computer work 95% of it in my underwear, just putting on clothes for the camera pretty much. Room a mess, no desire to clean it. Starting other businesses, bringing the merchandise home and her eventually forcing me to contain it to my room which was now a warehouse, office, studio and bedroom. 

By the way we got separate bedrooms about a year or 2 into living in the new place, 2 or 3 years into the relationship, because she wanted it. We would usually sleep in the same bed but our opposite schedules would really affect her sleep and thusbher mood, hormones, sex drive, appetite, weight. A lot. I eventuallyt acquiesced but we typically fell asleep together in her room. 


So how COULD I clean my room, it wasn&#x27;t that it was physically dirty, just literally full of stuff that could go nowhere else really. But it doesn&#x27;t matter.

I made the mistake in July of saying, after a period in the summer where we were having a lot more sex, spending a lot more time together, communicating a lot better &quot;Hey I&#x27;m really happy I think our relationship has gotten to the best place it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;m so proud of us.&quot;

Why did I jinx it?

Within a month we were pushing each other away. Cold. She asked me to leave for the last 2 weeks of summer and stay with my parents. She needed &quot;space&quot; and hadn&#x27;t actually accomplished so many things she wanted to do around the house with her summer.

When school started again she literally couldn&#x27;t tolerate me going to check on her for 5 minutes. I had to be isolated, quiet, couldn&#x27;t disturb her even for a minute or she said she couldn&#x27;t focus for over and hour after even if I just came in for a quick check in. It got to the point where I hated her, thought she was just a fucking asshole, and would whisper &quot;I want to break up&quot; everytime she responded so horribly as if I was the worst annoyance in the world who she wanted dead when I desperately tried for the umpteenth time to put aside our tensions and be nice and sweet and ask how my baby was doing. Turns out she heard it every time.

I really did want to break up but the problem was I was still completely out of control of how in love with her I was. It was biochemical, totally not a choice. She HAPPENED to me, and she still was to this day. Even when she had changed into this rude sexless jerk, I still wanted her more than anyone or anything and had eyes for no one else. I couldn&#x27;t break up, there had to be some way to thug out the relationship... something would work eventually, give it time.


Then I took a work trip to Seattle and I almost did something I would&#x27;ve regretted so much. I met a girl at a bar and went home with her. But on our way there I pussed out, showed her my phone background of me and my girlfriend, and started talking about her, mostly how much I love her, how proud I am of her, what she does for school which is basically work with her program. The vibe instantly changed and it was fine we actually had a lot of fun and talked all night about life and her issues and all sorts of stuff. Super interesting girl. Never spoke to her again.

But my ego had been bolstered. I felt like &quot;oh ok, I *could* break up, because clearly I could&#x27;ve hooked up with that girl who herself was hot, nowhere near as hot as my girlfriend, but I mean cmon, in 30 years I&#x27;ve never seen ANY woman as hot as her so that&#x27;s not even a possibility. There is no dating up from here, she&#x27;s IT. So hot enough has to be enough. And I&#x27;m still attractive to other women, I&#x27;ve still got it. I can feel confident that im not sticking around out of fear or desperation. Maybe my girlfriend should stsrt respecting me more, does she not know that I&#x27;m actually super desirable and could leave her for any number of girls at the drop of a hat? Maybe I should let her know because she literally acts like I&#x27;m a worthless piece of shit that does nothing but take away things from her life and make it worse than if I weren&#x27;t in it.&quot;


So I started dropping hints until eventually she was <mark>forced</mark> to ask me what happened


See on every other trip or even any time I went backnto our hometown and women were anywhere near me my girlfriend got out of this world insecure and jealous. Nonstop texting. Hanging up on me if we called for a mere mention of another woman existing. Absolute total meltdowns treating me like I&#x27;m the most horrible monster hurting her in the world for existing near other women. 

I didn&#x27;t mind it, in fact, as someone who can get insecure myself I showed exactly how I wanted to be treated if I ever got like that. I woukdnreassure her to no end and tell her how much I loved her and how there&#x27;s literally nobody that could ever compare and that even though I wish she just knew this, telling her that I will always reassure her to no end no matter what.

Do I get that when I get jealous over her going out with her girlfriends? Or seeing a male friend? Nope. Of course I don&#x27;t ever react that way either, but being treated with the same love compassion, attention and respect I gave her every time was all I ever wanted, because it was everything I never got. I was treated like I kept her prisoner or like she couldn&#x27;t go out comfortably, when that wasn&#x27;t the case. I would literally be out in public on a work trip on my phone nonstop for hours apologizing to the people I would be with profusely giving this girl every type of reassurance possible. Her? She resented me if I even made a small comment or asked questions.


But when I went to Seattle she was just so clearly done. She didn&#x27;t care anymore, which reflected to me as she didn&#x27;t care about me anymore. And I still think she doesn&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t show it at least. That total lack of care or concern absolutely infuriated me. She was fully checked outbof the relationship. She had already grieved as if I had cheated on her, when I literally had NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT!

So I threw a tantrum and went home with a girl just to prove to myself that I could. And when she asked, I didn&#x27;t give every detail, but I told her more or less, nothing, I met a girl at the bar who specifically said I was a &quot;hot guy from Miami&quot; (this was at one point said), went to a second location with her, then hung out at her house, but she knew I had a girlfriend, I didn&#x27;t do anything.


She of course was very upset but not like any other time. She just quietly said stuff about getting in strangers&#x27; cars being unsafe and what if she did something like that, though she never would. She really was fully checked out


Her mother came to visit for like 4 days and it was the most tense time EVER. I couldn&#x27;t gonin her room, the energy was just so tense I hated every second I had to just sotnin my room all day and night waiting and waiting for this woman to leave.


Finally the second she did my girlfriend asked me downstairs to talk. I was sure this was a break up! But no.

She said she had &quot;made a decision&quot; and it was best that I move back home, alone, and she stay here to finish college for her last year. My first words were &quot;why not break up?&quot;
 She said &quot;no that isn&#x27;t what I want i still want to be in your life and you in mine, I just made a decision and I&#x27;m not going back on it.&quot;

If I didn&#x27;t move out of this house, she would. Even with no job, minimal financial aid, minimal parental assistance, she would find a fucking way I guess.  Idk what on earth there was to do. I tried every argument, financial, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense we couldn&#x27;t afford it especially her. I sat in denial for a while hutbthen just fought and fought and desperately fought pushing her further and further and further away. 

I had 2 months to get out. I had to find a new life. A buddy offered me a room. My girlfriend and I were growing further and further apart. The disdain and resentment were all that were left I had tried so hard and she was so obviously done thst my attempts were just annoyances and how could I maintain a nice, caring, jovial facade while going out when she was always so fucking miserable openly. She just didn&#x27;t care. Why on earth aren&#x27;t we just breaking up, clearly we must HATE each other, but mostly you. I love you, I just hate whatever this person you&#x27;ve become that&#x27;s so sour and mean and abusive to me is. You literally don&#x27;t even try, why do I have to try only for every attempt to be shot down.


It was awful. I came home after a month, to do a trial run for a month. I was nothing. I was watching videos nonstop on how to win your wife back that all sounded so exactly like our situation it was unbelievable. I spent 2 weeks at home before realizing I was out of clothes, and driving uo without saying a word until I was 10 minutes away. I came home cold, didn&#x27;t touch her, didn&#x27;t want to. We had a no BS straight faced somewhat tough small talk conversation before sitting down together and smoking pot which I almost never do and she does constantly, somehow. I softened a bit, went uo behind her on the couch, put my hands on her shoulders, kissed the top of her head and said &quot;Baby. I love you. Do you want to break up?&quot;

My response was the most passionate make out session we had had in YEARS leading to the best sex we had had since Europe. I literally couldn&#x27;t believe it. She had literally cut off the possibility of intimacy for like 2 years because she got braces and started saying she &quot;didn&#x27;t like kissing anymore&quot;. So this was incredible. 


But then my mood switched. I guess she wanted me aloof and saying I was just coming by to get clothes and I&#x27;d be gone in the morning. I changed my gone and was back to lovey dovey and deciding I could stay the whole weekend with her and &quot;love&quot;. 


The next day she told me her friend who I strongly distrust and disapprove of because she used to do onlyfans (apparently was groomed into doing it by a man much older than her, then stopped a few years before to pursue the career she went to college for, but still, absolutely hate that this has become her only friend in the new city and them living together while we are separated but not broken up? No way. 


But we can&#x27;t finish the discussion she has the worst meltdown I&#x27;ve ever seen halfway through. Talking to me is just unbearable to her. She WEEEEEEPS for an hour and then comes to my room where I&#x27;m desperately mindlessly gambling on my phone to find ANY kind of release or distraction, screaming &quot;WE&#x27;RE BREAKING UP!&quot;


Eventually she calms down and we agreed to do what we were going to. Live apart and still be together and see if it works. She asks &quot;you know we could try it and still break up right?&quot; I say &quot;everyone COULD break up. I&#x27;m willing to take the chance&quot;

Anyway I leave the next day. I can&#x27;t believe it went from the best to the worst weekend of our relationship just like that. I have a meltdown myself a panic thinking about the roommate. I think my girlfriend will cheat on me or is already, with her. What else could explain being suddenly super horny in the middle of this horrible separation maybe breakup and months of intimacy issues? It had to be her fucking someone else and just having leftover raging hormones. So I have a panic attack and try to get in contact with my girlfriend as I&#x27;m driving home and she eventually calls me angry as FUCK like &quot;why the fuck can&#x27;t you handle being apart from me for 3 hours before you start having a panic attacj?&quot; And finally I tell her im terrified of her cheating.

She thinks it&#x27;s annoying and laughable. Makes me feel a million times worse. Then says she&#x27;s in love with someone else.

I almost crash my car.

She says her married childhood male best friend, yes, the one she told me not to worry about, that she realized she is in love with him over the last year. But she can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t tell him,  but that he makes her feel loved and seen in a way nobody else ever has since she was a little girl. 

Holy crap did that mess things up. I literally almost crashed my car. But at least it wasn&#x27;t the female friend. I would&#x27;ve probably actually kms. I cannot take it for another damn second.

I finish setting up at home


But remember that my brother asked me to come back another weekend? Turned out his new girlfriend had an oxycodone prescription she filled that day and they would take it together and get high for 3 or 4 days whenever she did. 

I was clean from opiates for over 8 years at that point. So I thought &quot;well I can handle it for just a weekend&quot;


Shockingly, I could not handle it for just a weekend. Instantly as I had money now I learned how to buy it on the darkweb and was using nonstop constantly daily thinking nobody would notice and I could handle it now since I could afford it. Until I couldn&#x27;t stop again because I was physically addicted and I was calling detoxes now and then thinking about coming and getting clean all at once. 


So I came back for my last 2 weeks and I am devastated and it has been a nightmare and I have been using more than ever and it has only made my anxieties worse.

I come home like a demon tornado on the night she must finish the most important assignment of her entire college career.

We get in a huge fight and finally she realizes something is wrong and I tell her I relapsed. She wants tk call the police because I&#x27;m literally incapable of shutting up stopping crying I am in a total rock bottom relapse maximum pathetic out of control fucked up state. I have to leave in my car to sleep in a parking lot and I still can&#x27;t stop texting and calling her.

Eventually I park for a few hours andbthen come home when I stsrt to come down. 


I weep for hours into my pillow until the sun comes up. She hears it all. It isn&#x27;t pretty.


So she says we are breaking up. I come up with a plan to get clean, starting with a taper down process. Say what you will, if I stopped cold turkey it would&#x27;ve been the worst hell imaginable. 

I decide to start right then, but i spend the day while she is at schoom talking to my friends, telling them I relapsed and we are breaking up and making a plan for me to come home, get clean, get absolutely jacked and fuck as many girls as possible. I fully accept the break up and make a list of all the things we have to do TODAY, get my name off all bills, credit card off everything. Netflix, Amazon, every single streaming service, all accounts blocked on everything. It all has to happen AND I want emotional closure TODAY.

She gets home and I tell her that ok, this is happening.


Somehow it turns into &quot;ok wait go get clean and then call me in a few weeks when. You&#x27;re done&quot;.


So what, no contact while I get clean? OK fine. Just wait for me.


The girl who can go months without sex, WHO DEFINITELY HASNT cheated on me, suddenly says &quot;why would I waste my time if maybe you show up in a month or 2 and want to break up with me and now I wasted all that time waiting for you?&quot;, as if she is sooooo insatiably horny that she can&#x27;t wait a month or so without getting sex from some stranger!? I can clearly say I won&#x27;t cheat and that if she cheats that is fully giving up on the relationship, there is no coming back.


But then she says &quot;If I go out with my friends and some guy comes up to me and he is nice to me and wants to take me on a date, i won&#x27;t say no&quot;. I say that&#x27;s unacceptable that is cheating. She says she won&#x27;t lie to me. OK so I guess we HAVE to break up since you can&#x27;t understand suddenly what cheating means. Ok, let&#x27;s break up, she says totally calmly and seriously. No, no no we have a plan why on earth would we break up just tell me you won&#x27;t cheat. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to lie to you&quot;

This is the worst torture imaginable. If this is the woman I want to marry she would never ever cheat, 

Why would she suddenly be saying these horrible things? 


I can&#x27;t take it. It is literally killing me and im still on the drugs but much less trying to taper down but still I quickly realize I actually hate the way they affect me when Im having strong emotions.  They make me an erratic uncontrollable anxious fucking mess! 


I can&#x27;t stop bringing it up. Thinking about it. It fucking tortures me nonstop it is all that exists. 


Until finally the last 3 days she leaves the house to go out with her friends for Halloween and screams at me over the phone that we are doing TWO MONTHS NO CONTACT and that&#x27;s what she needs. I can&#x27;t believe it. I literally have no say in this.


I get the uhaul, get my things and come home.

On the last night I give up fighting. I come to her and say &quot;Im done fighting. Can we just smoke weed and watch Friends?&#x27;

And hour later she comes to my room looking at me like a lost puppy &quot;You wanna watch Friends?&quot;

I smoke and all my worries and anxieties are gone. I laugh and genuinely enjoy her company. I flirt with her like I just met her for the first time and she&#x27;s the most beautiful girl ive ever seen (she is though). We have a great night laughing and having fun but she asks to sleep alone.

The next day we finish packing but I stay in that same mood of having let go, no more fighting, just flirting and having fun. She starts crying at one point saying I&#x27;m confusing her, why am I acting like everything is fine, and I sayc because there&#x27;s nothing else I can do and I really want to go on a date with you. But oh man my next two months are gonna be really busy, so maybe in 2 months?

She agrees.

We have a fun last day to an extent. When the room is empty she cries in my arms. As I&#x27;m leaving she is weeping and saying we have a chance and she believes in us, that we can do this. 


I don&#x27;t cry in front of her but when it hits it hits me, in the kitchen I fall to my knees clutching my chest because I swear to god it&#x27;s ripping apart I have to physically hold myself together or my chest will break I physically feel it. It hurts so badly. Why is this happening. I hear her footsteps, wipe my face and stand up smiling as she enters the kitchen with tears in her eyes 

&quot;Im ready to go&quot;. I say with a <mark>forced</mark> smile. 

She says goodbye but refuses a kiss. Only hugs. I drive away screaming my fucking head off I can&#x27;t believe this. But we aren&#x27;t no contact for a few days.


The next day she brings my car down and takes a train back up. I get 45 minutes with her as i drive her to her parents who wilk take her to the train. Unfortunately I&#x27;m back to trying to talk about it, I ask if she really wants this. She says some really hurtful things and has the nonchalance I fought against for so long again. I don&#x27;t know this woman anymore. She can&#x27;t kiss me as I leave her it&#x27;d be too hard. I want to fucking die. This is torture. Why would you do this to me?

But I get plugged in with my lifelong friends back home, quickly build a scoial life, go see a doctor to detox at home, get off the drugs shockingly quickly. Then my friend is going to a festival in a week back where I lived. I&#x27;ve never gone, I feel great suddenly and I say I&#x27;m going to go too.

And also I have some stuff my girlfriend left in my car and she has some final packages that came to the house. After a week of no contact I text her saying I&#x27;ll be intown and if we can meet up to exchange our things. She says ok. 


We end up meeting up at the supermarket parking lot next to our home. She is furious. Barely wants to talk to me. Tells me not to touch her as I go for a hug. I&#x27;m in a great mood personally. She is angry that Im acting like this is &quot;normal&quot; and I say it is normal. After a while she calms down and starts actually talking to me, asking me why I&#x27;m here which she never once asked. I tell her the truth. She says im a drug addict and a liar, ans asks if I&#x27;m going to do drugs with my &quot;drug friends&quot; (I have no drug friends). I telm her the truth, no we might smoke weed or drink a bit but that&#x27;s all. Im clean already. Just on the detox meds for a few more days but feeling great the withdrawal wasn&#x27;t all that bad.

I ask her to promise me that if she cheats she will tell me IMMEDIATELY, because it would be really fucked up to make me wait to January just to find out. She agrees and I promise to do the same.

She asks if I still want a hug. I shrug, she gets out and gives me a loving embrace, says she loves me and believes in me. I tell her not to worry and I love her so much. But still she says she&#x27;s not ready to kiss.

We go to the festival and I think of cheating but I just talk to everyone about my girlfriend. I could never cheat. I&#x27;m just acting defensively. But really after hearing how our meeting went all my friends all arrive at one conclusion &quot;oh this girl really loves you. It&#x27;s like you cheated on her with the drugs. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s really going to cheat on you, I think she just said that to try and make you feel the same betrayal she must have felt from you lying to her about using for almost a full year&quot;. 


I actually.... agree. And I&#x27;m suddenly not worried about her cheating anymore.


I really focus on myself, start losing the weight. I was over 205 pounds when I came down. Today, 7 weeks later, I&#x27;m down to 182. I have tons of new friends, I go out all the time. I got my own apartment, still in the process of furnishing it. I feel great. Everyone tells me I look great but I don&#x27;t see it yet, but I can see that it&#x27;s coming. I have fun above all else for the time im here. I talk to whoever will listen about my girlfriend and the separation. It&#x27;s hard but eventually I realize I can&#x27;t do anything about it so I talk less. 

I come to the realization that if we stay together, great, I want to marry this woman, but that if she changes into someone else or chests on me, GREAT,I was just wrong about who I wanted to marry and have children with and thank God I found out now. 


But after another month in the 2nd week of December I realize I don&#x27;t want this no contact bullshit anymore. Something financial had come up and I had handled it without a word. I realize after 2 weeks that im actually very abgry and think my girlfriend with her new roommate is extremely irresponsible for letting this come to me meaning she didn&#x27;t do all the organization and things she was supposed to. So I text her &quot;Hey we need to talk about something&quot; and say when I&#x27;m available. She says we can call after 10. I see the message at 1015 and she says &quot;now&quot; and we call.


We talk about the financial thing. She&#x27;s upset that I handled it, she apparently handled it a day later and it has been &quot;really hsrd&quot; the past month with her friend moving in. I don&#x27;t believe her but whatever. She sounds exasperated. 

I basically say I want no contact to end. She says she tried to break up with me for a month and I &quot;<mark>forced</mark>&quot; her into this. I don&#x27;t remember that being the case whatsoever so I give her an open invitation to break up right this second. She can&#x27;t give a straight answer. A while later I try again. Once more, no straight answer. Eventually I ask &quot;do you want to break up?&quot; And she admits she does not know. It has been a month by the way of no contact. My life could not be more different. 


She says we can start being in contact. I text her a few hours later and she says she can&#x27;t be getting &quot;so many&quot; texts from me. I sent 1 text. She says it&#x27;s too much and she needs space. I try to be understanding and say we can take it slow she says she can&#x27;t open up to me like before. I respond with compassion. She ghosts me.


The next day at noon I say that&#x27;s absolutely not ok. She responds &quot;lol okay&quot;. I now know this girl doesn&#x27;t give a fuck about me and has no respect for me so I can&#x27;t do this anymore. I say &quot;ok we need to talk RIGHT NOW, it won&#x27;t take long&quot; but she says &quot;I don&#x27;t have time for this&quot; and I say &quot;wow, the irony, you LITERALLY aren&#x27;t letting me break up with you&quot;.


And hour later she responds that she is I ut of class. We speak on the phone for two hours with me opening &quot;im breaking up with you.&quot;

Somehow it turns into we will do what we were do in no before for 2 more weeks and see each other the weekend before Christmas. 


I reach out the next morning to say I want to help her with the things she says she has been struggling with, mainly work around the house which I can easily pay someone to do, like lugging away my old furniture I left behind or fixing things that are broke in the house. She says we can talk about it in our conversation in 2 weeks


I reach out again week later to ask how she is doing and she says &quot;no contact means no contact. You have broken it twice already. Please let me have these weeks without you clouding my thoughts&quot;

I dunno about you but in my eyes the person I want to be my partner does not &quot;cloud my thoughts&quot;. Sounds a lot like this girl wants to break up. But I give her a week and then come back to her telling her my schedule for the week she says she will be coming home.

She doesnt respond. I tell some friends that night and the next morning we text about it. I write a long message about communication being a necessity and me not being willing to be with her if this is how she&#x27;s going to respond to me. Instead I&#x27;m advised to call her. I do, and INSTANTLY she rejects the call and texts me that it is absolutely not ok for me to be calling her.

This turns into a 3 hour conversation entirely over voice memos which is basically just a call where you can&#x27;t interrupt the other person. But she doesn&#x27;t want to call. She says many things about not feeling respected in the ONE boundary she set, the no contact, so how could she expect me to respect her other boundaries. I tell her I literally feel like you have 0 respect for me and I have never successfully set up a boundary that you haven&#x27;t laughed at. Even fucking CHEATING. She says I keep &quot;harping&quot; on this, but like, no it&#x27;s literally cheating. What are you talking about?! 

She finally says she was going to contact me later in the week when she knew what day she was coming down. So ok, I leave her alone. We say we love each other. I wait and wait and wait and Thursday comes and she still hasn&#x27;t texted me so I wait and she texts Friday morning saying she is coming down TODAY.


We agree to meet not this weekend but the day AFTER Christmas for our date. We don&#x27;t have a time and place but I ask if no contact can be over now. She says ok. 


I decide to give her space, even though I&#x27;ve done that for almost 2 mo ths and would rather die than keep living in a relationship that I slong distance where we aren&#x27;t constantly communicating what we are doing and how our day is going and what our plans are so that we can rebuild the trust that has evaporated for this one. But still I say &quot;ok let me know when you&#x27;re home&quot;. At 10am.

Does she? No. I text her at 8pm asking if she got home safe. She says she &quot;just&quot; got here. I try to continue a bit of conversation and it is like getting blood from a stone so I say im going to bed early which isn&#x27;t a lie, ive been sick all week.


3 hours later my friends have convinced me to go out to a rave, so I text her an update of what I am doing where I am going who I will be with and that I&#x27;ll text her when I leave. She literally instantly reads it and says nothing.


I go to the rave, have a blast, text her when I get home. 


Here we are the next morning.


Dude wtf do I do to reestablish this relationship. I literally do not know if I want this anymore. I know *I* do but I do not want it if she is going to act this way like she doesn&#x27;t give a fuck. I know i need to set strong boundaries like for example, texting needs to be daily. We have communicated constantly, not every second of every day, but letting each other know where we are who we are with and what we are doing at all times for FIVE YEARS. You can&#x27;t act like you forgot!!!! That is literally the only boundary I can think of now though.


If we are really going to do this, I don&#x27;t feel ive seen any sort of care or concer to heal the relationship from her. I&#x27;ve felt like the only one trying for so so so long and I&#x27;d literally rather <mark>blow</mark> my brains out than keep lugging this girl along into a relationship she clearly has no interest being in yet equally refuses to just make up her mind and either leave it or be in it fully. 


Also if we are only going g to see each other this one day, I&#x27;m trying to have sex. I have my own apartment now, it isn&#x27;t fully furnished yet but that&#x27;s my end goal for if the date goes well. We both agreed dates need to be like we just stsrted dating, not in familiarity but as in they need to be fun as we both completely forgot how to enjoy ourselves together. I have been having a blast back home and I have so many ideas for fun things we can do together but if she is going to be the killjoy sour woman she&#x27;s been for years now that I have to fight so hard to keep talking nicely to despite her showing open disdain until I can&#x27;t take it and I say something and we start arguing because God forbid you try for once in your life, really try like I do every single day when I brush our problems aside and try to act normal, which you&#x27;ve never been able to do, then no shot I can ever have fun with her no matter where we go. I&#x27;m not the problem i n that circumstance!


Idk man. I literally don&#x27;t know if I want to do this because she hasn&#x27;t shown me she wants to do this. And im tired of being afraid to be direct with her about my wants and needs. She really is in my eyes not even my dream girl because not even my dreams are farfetched enough to let me wind up with such a beautiful brilliant girl as her, she&#x27;s beyond my wildest dreams at her best. And even at her worst I cant help how much I am still fully in love with her. I actually hate it it would be so much easier if I could be attracted to another girl or want to cheat or something but literally nature just messed me up and it is just her. So idk what to do now that we are supposed to be restarting this relationship. </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Fair warning, it’s a long read. I apologize in advance.

A month ago I met this farm girl on Tinder. Her and I both had a friend who dared us to try it out for a month and see what happens. I hot her number and we started texting and getting to know each other. After a couple days of texting, I learned she had a rough childhood and still a rough life now.

She’s from Montana and her parents are divorced. Apparently she has restraining orders against both of them because they were involved in illegal activities, although separately. She moved to a different state to live with her aunt and cousins. 

She rents a camper on their property and uses their house’s amenities. They fill the role of her family, and anything they say goes. Although, they aren’t the best influence on her and give her shit when she goes out to do stuff by herself. They are wealthy by inheritance so they <mark>blow</mark> the money on horses. It’s not inherently bad, and she’s happy with her $300 a week. She cut ties with friends she made here because despite her being considerate and having compassion towards them, they never reciprocated. She works on a ranch and sometimes as a flagger at a motocross track. She told me she’s looking for a long term relationship because she does everything by herself and wants a best friend that’s more than just friends to share that with.

She doesn’t want a cowboy because she said they just care about the next rodeo and are idiots. She doesn’t want a motocross guy because they have big egos. She wants someone who is intellectual and humble. I don’t know if she realized it but she was describing me to be honest. She hinted towards that, and she would send good morning texts first and then initiate conversation in the evening everyday. Despite her baggage, I come from a tough, dysfunctional life too. Things out of my control. I’m a man of Faith and learned to overcome those problems and insecurities over the years to be a good partner one day. She seems to be on the right track but not quite there yet. I saw her potential so I showed grace and patience, and the chance for us to get to know each other better before calling quits if necessary.

First date went well. We spent 4-5 hours at the restaurant, and clearly she wanted to keep talking but she had work the next morning. Me being in college, I had break that following week so I tried to hang out with her. It was difficult because she was always tasked with something on her aunt’s property so she wasn’t always able to physically hang out. One night when we texted and I was watching a movie with my parents, she remarked that she wanted snuggles and movies but felt it was never gonna happen. I wasn’t sure how to respond but she continued the conversation luckily. The day after Thanksgiving, she texted me in the afternoon to try to get lunch with me when she was off work, but I was out of town so we made plans for that evening.

I drove from my parent’s place back to my apartment after getting us food. I specially brought some card games, a puzzle, and a fluffy blanket for her - since I figured she might wanna snuggle lol. I ended up waiting for her longer than expected because her aunt made her feed horses and stack hay first. She then waited for her cousins to leave first because they hive her crap if she “does stuff alone” or is “seeing a guy” even if he’s a friend. Eventually, she made it safely and we started our second date. Still, she’s very shy in person and found it difficult to know what to talk about, so I was carrying the conversation mostly. I told her we’ll get more comfortable if we do something. After eating, she wanted to build the puzzle. We continued talking and both our nerves were set at ease.

She was very tired and decided to lay down next to me on the couch. I offered the blanket, she rejected the offer, but I knew she actually wanted it so I just put it gently over her. She fell asleep for an hour while I worked on the puzzle. After she woke up, she felt embarrassed for falling asleep but I said it was okay. At that point I had decided I liked her personality first, and now I find her physically beautiful too. She said she should go back home because she’s afraid her dog was gonna mess her camper up being locked inside. I offered her the chance to stay the night because I didn’t want her to fall asleep at the wheel. My intentions were only to be considerate and caring. I was not looking to have sex because we were still getting to know each other, I was dealing with a lot of personal stuff trying to not project it on her, and I don’t want a hookup. I just want a genuine long term relationship, and the rest is up for debate between us when we cross that bridge.

After I went back in the living room in my pj’s, she told me she let her aunt know she’s staying the night at her friend’s place. She followed me to bed, I let her pick a side, and we went to sleep. I could not fall asleep the whole night but she was fast asleep. I took my shirt off because I was very hot. After about and hour, she scooted closer to me and we ended up cuddling. After a few more hours, I turned on my back because my hip was sore and she immediately turned towards me and was half on top of me. I figured she was semi-conscious because she starting feeling my chest and moved her hand towards my face. I let her and decide to hold her hand with mine and her leg with the other.

Eventually, she woke up and was surprised I was awake so I told her I couldn’t sleep. She remarked how hot it was. I said, “you’re hot.” She made a shy expression taking it one way and then took her hoodie off acknowledging the literal meaning. I meant it both ways but I didn’t tell her. She was little spoon again and turned back in a way to brush her fingers through my hair. She then started kissing me. Everything here on out was mutually consensual by the way. I didn’t really want sex because I didn’t know her too well and had stress from personal stuff I wasn’t sure how to tell her yet, because I wanted us to first establish our relationship more or less before making any moves. I was afraid to reject her in case she felt it was because I don’t find her attractive. I decide to make out and it was fine. She wanted me to keep going and I thought I could calm my thoughts but they got the best of me in the end. I’m inexperienced when it comes to sex so I was hesitant. She asked if I had done it before and I said once. I asked her about her and she said three times. She also reads smut by the way, so I think that adds to her “experience”. I fumbled during the process, not being in the right mind-space, but she interpreted it as her being unattractive.

I assured her that’s not the case and that I was overthinking things, but still couldn’t bring myself to talk to her about what was going on in my life at the moment. I believe my mistake and silence got to her head in the end. She stayed an hour longer than she had to. I thought she’d up and leave if she was turned off. I walked her to her car and she said goodbye hugging me. I felt pretty heartbroken after that day about the whole situation because I was afraid I hurt her, even though I might not have, and felt hurt myself.

Over the next week, I checked in and noticed our conversations were dryer than they used to be. My gut told me something was off. That next Tuesday I told her I needed to tell something important in person or at least phone call. She kept insisting I text it because she doubted it’s too much for text. I wanted to talk to her about big changes in my life at the moment and my near-future direction, and I wanted to explain to her I want her in my life but want to take things slower so we can build a proper relationship. I wanted to see if she’d be willing to be by my side, after all, she did make it clear she’s looking for her ride or die when we started talking. She was moving with her cousins soon to a bigger property not to far from where she lives now, so she has some changes going on too. Anyways, I apologized about that one morning that I didn’t mean to make her feel undesired/unattractive. I expressed I wanted her in my life and had more to tell her next time we meet. She didn’t really understand what I was trying to say, proving that it was not meant for a simple text.

The following day, she turned her phone off the whole day until late evening. She had never done this before, adding to my suspicion that things are going sideways. I was given advice to allow her some space so I didn’t text her the following day, leaving her being the last response. That following day, she sent a text in the morning saying, “Welp, I’ll leave you alone thank you for your time it was nice getting the know you for the most part I wish you the best.” I freaked out and tried calling her. No answer. I was afraid she’d blocked me but after a couple more attempts, someone else responded on her phone saying, “She’s at work please stop calling”. My best guess is it was her cousin but I never asked. We ended up having an argument where they said she felt I was messing with her, ghosting her, and she’s trying work on herself but they try to convince her she doesn’t need to change. I decided to give it my all and explain what I was going through personally and wasn’t sure how to tell her yet and wanted her in my life.

After they couldn’t find anything I said to further pick at, they stopped responding. The next morning, I sent one last attempt message telling her I’m sorry how things ended but feel we should talk and figure out what happened before calling it quits. I respectfully added that I don’t want to force her and respect it she doesn’t want to. I never got a response, but she never blocked me because my call after few days rang a few times before going to voicemail instead of just one time. She has android by the way and I have iPhone. I really feel if she just gave it more chance, we could have worked things out because it was a big misunderstanding. I also believe her cousins and aunt definitely have an influence on how she reacts and perceives men, not to mention her past toxic relationships. She was aware of the toxicity, that’s why she ended things and they went back to their toxic ex’s. It’s hard to just move on because I see her potential and I feel she’s my type, despite the stereotype surrounding “horse girls”. She’s more like a farm girl in my opinion than a horse girl.

If you read this far, I greatly appreciate it and any advice. Any thoughts on if I should text her or call her on Christmas coming up soon or leave it? I did technically do everything I can and she her silence could be her answer, or she’s still processing.</div>

My girlfriend has depression and social phobia, this makes her more closed and anti-social, but she never wanted to insult anyone or offend anyone, she just preferred to spend more time with me in my room when she came to my house, and I never saw any problem with that, I never <mark>forced</mark> her to do anything she didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with and I always understood when she preferred to stay at home than go out with me and my friends/family.  
She never had a very peaceful relationship in her house either, because her older sister has borderline and on top of that she still doesn&#x27;t have any way in life, wanting her mother and father to pay for everything for her, while she doesn&#x27;t give a damn if She&#x27;s not helping at all, she&#x27;s even gone to the police because her sister breaks things when she doesn&#x27;t get what she wants, and on top of that, her mother gives in to all her sister&#x27;s blackmail, but when it&#x27;s my girlfriend who asks for help financial situation with something, her mother always has a certain resistance before helping, and my girlfriend never complains, because she doesn&#x27;t want to make the situation worse at home.

She never had a very peaceful relationship in her house either, cause her older sister has borderline and on top of that she still doesn&#x27;t have any way in life, wanting her parents to pay everything for her, while she doesn&#x27;t give a damn if she&#x27;s not helping at all, they even had to call the police because her sister breaks things when she doesn&#x27;t get what she wants, and on top of that, her mother gives in to all her sister&#x27;s blackmail, but when it&#x27;s my girlfriend who asks for financial help with something, her mother always has a certain resistance before helping, and my girlfriend never complains, because she doesn&#x27;t want to make the situation worse at home.

Anyway, recently my parents talked to me and said that they felt a little uncomfortable with the fact that my girlfriend was not participating in our daily lives and they would like her to try more. But that&#x27;s where it is, she was already trying as hard as she could, but due to her condition, she simply can&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s an effort that for most people isn&#x27;t a big deal, but for her it&#x27;s a huge difficulty, taking into account that she works from Monday to Saturday and is very tired, just wanting to rest with me afterwards, or sometimes, go out with me/her friends somewhere.

So, I spoke to her as gently as possible about this conversation, she understood their side, and then a problem arose, she wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable coming to my house anymore, because she would know that my parents are uncomfortable, and since her house was a place that neither of us would feel comfortable in, we saw that we were without a place to be together whenever we wanted. So we started talking, and during the conversation, she talked about how her psychological illnesses affected me, and this is something that I couldn&#x27;t deny, because they affected me a little. So, after a lot of talking and a lot of crying, we mutually decided to break up.

Now the difficult part for me, this breakup was 4 months ago, and about two weeks ago we met by chance and ended up talking a little and then we went out latter to talk more. We talked about how we were dealing with the breakup, and she mentioned that she had found a place to rent, so she could leave her house and have a little corner of her own. When she told me that, I thought about how our biggest problem had basically been solved, so I threw some hints about relationships, and she said that this time we were broken up showed her how she thinks she shouldn&#x27;t be in a relationship, I asked her why she thinks that, and she told me that she just doesn&#x27;t know, she just feels like she shouldn&#x27;t be in a romantic relationship with anyone right now. I couldn&#x27;t help it and, speaking in a joking tone, I asked if I asked her to go back, would she come back with me, and she replied that it would be very tempting, but she wouldn&#x27;t come back.

That was a hard <mark>blow</mark> for me, because those 4 months of breaking up showed me the opposite: I was much happier being with her, and the way her depression affected me is infinitely inferior than the good her company did me, not only that, but we rarely fought, it was always very harmonious, we didn&#x27;t have toxic traits towards each other. But what left me most confused was that she said that she also felt happier when she was dating me, and that I always made her very happy, she even wants to keep in touch, that I go to her house sometimes so we can watch series, see memes or just talk, not to mention that in the two weeks that we kept in touch, sometimes we joked about getting back into the relationship.

It&#x27;s our first relationship, our first breakup, so maybe that influenced the decision to break up, due to immaturity in that aspect. However, I have already decided that she is the woman of my life, I feel more alone and lost without her, she supported me whenever I needed it and I always supported her too, I feel as if no other woman in the world was enough for me just like she was. And that&#x27;s why, the next time we see each other, I really want to declare myself to her (again) and ask us to get back together, even though she said that if I asked her, she wouldn&#x27;t come back, no matter how much she wanted to, because I believe there&#x27;s still a chance, even if small, that she will change her mind, because she can&#x27;t tell me why she thinks she shouldn&#x27;t be in a relationship, so maybe her head is still confused about the whole situation. But I&#x27;m clearly going to respect her if the answer is a no, and if that&#x27;s the case now, I think we&#x27;re going to have to cut off contact for good, because seeing her and knowing that we&#x27;re no longer dating opens up the wound of the breakup.

I&#x27;m paid minimum wage in a temp job that&#x27;ll last until december, so I can&#x27;t move in with her, but she lives right next to me now, and I can definitely help her with house chores and can be there in 5 minutes whenever she needs me.

So please give me your opinions and advices, cause even when I said I&#x27;m decided to go back together, I&#x27;m also lost, maybe I should wait a little more, what do you guys think?

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend in good terms, mutually. Relationship lasted for 7 years and we&#x27;ve been apart for 4 months now, started talking to each other again for 2 weeks, I want to go back together, but she feels like she shouldn&#x27;t be in a romantic realationship with anyone, but she can&#x27;t find out why she thinks like this and she admitted that she was happier when we were dating, even tho she said this, I want to tell her I want to be with her again.  </div>

</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">I have been together with my girlfriend for the past 2 years.

We have always been different -She is very extraverted, whereas I am clearly introverted - and this has always caused some friction on various levels. Despite some of the issues listed below, most of the time we are both very happy together.

She loves going to concerts, mass events, festivals. She would love for me to go with, her but she also knows I wouldn&#x27;t feel at ease there. She does ask if I want to join her, and I know she respects that I don&#x27;t want to come, but I sometimes feel <mark>forced</mark> to accompany her and end up having a miserable time.

I am not a recluse by any means, but I stay at home much more often than she does. While she goes out for a drink with friends, catches up with family or goes to the gym, I mostly stay at home. Since &quot;I have the time&quot;, I always end up making dinner. She usually gets home around 8PM and we eat together. After dinner, she will just sit on the couch and watch some tv. I feel like I cook and clean to allow her to she spend all her time outside being &#x27;fun&#x27;, but the minute she gets home, we are both exhausted and I don&#x27;t even get to experience the best version of her.

Closely related to the above, I am quite bad at taking some distance and doing my own thing and she&#x27;s quite bad at giving me that space, so I tend to watch tv with her. Often times, that&#x27;s exactly what I want to do, sometimes it&#x27;s not. If I say I&#x27;ll leave the room, she&#x27;ll say she wants to spend time together because we haven&#x27;t seen each other all day (but then we still mostly watch television, and I don&#x27;t always get to relax in the way that would benefit me most).

We both have a specific interest or hobby that the other person doesn&#x27;t understand or respects: I don&#x27;t understand trying to look good/following influencers on social media, she doesn&#x27;t understand that I like to play videogames with my friends.

We have talked about this multiple times before, and have always agreed that we should pay more attention to these issues. However, I think with regards to these issues, we are just not a very good fit, and we tend to fall back into the same pattern relatively quickly.

Until recently, I&#x27;ve always felt that we could overcome these issues. Despite our differences, I felt like we were wanting to head in the same direction in life. A few weeks back, my girlfriend dropped the bomb on me that she wants to quit her job as a physical therapist. She explained that the reason is that she does not feel confident in her job. I suggested that the reason for this might be that she has made a big change in her job situation every 6 months in the past 2 years, and that she try working in a stable environment for a year. She said maybe and we didn&#x27;t speak on the topic further.

Yesterday, I found her looking for an entry-level job in the film industry. It was kind of a <mark>blow</mark> to me, as she ignored my advice completely.

To be very clear, I understand where she&#x27;s coming from. It&#x27;s a very demanding job, especially if you connect with and want the absolute best for every patient like she does. However, there&#x27;s three reasons why it is making me re-evaluate the viability of our entire relationship, and whether we can overcome our other issues.

She was finishing up her second master degree when we met. Over the past year, she did an additional post-graduate degree, while working full-time. This obviously cut into her personal time. However, most of what she &#x27;cut&#x27; was housework and time spent with me. We had a lot of arguments about this. It has augmented the feeling I was merely there to free up time for her to follow this degree, without even recognizing the sacrifices I was making. Her quitting the profession the moment she gets this degree feels like a slap in the face.

It simply doesn&#x27;t fit the future I had in mind. I have a demanding job myself. I want my partner to also have a demanding job. I know I sound elitist right now, but part of is definitely status and money. Another part is that my mother sacrificed her opportunity for a career for my dad, and I feel like she&#x27;s resented him for a long time for that once me and my siblings were more independent. I want to avoid that at all costs.

I am confident in who I am, I am 30 years old, with a stable career, and will not change much anymore. It seems like my girlfriend is still very much looking for her place in life. I can not blame her, we all need to do what we must to get where we want to be. However, I am at a point in life where I don&#x27;t want to be figuring things out anymore. I don&#x27;t think I can be there for her while she does.

I don&#x27;t want to force her to stay in a job that makes her unhappy, but I&#x27;m also quite confident that I can&#x27;t take another year of her figuring stuff out. I&#x27;m afraid the moment I try to tackle the subject one of both situations is locked in.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to give up her career, and it&#x27;s making me re-evaluate the relationship.</div>

Happy relationship has turned sour and surface level, and feels like i am only giving and giving. Should i break up?</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">TLDR: 

* Met in college, left previous relationships to be together. Moved in after becoming doctors.
* Issues arose when he struggled with exams, leading to communication breakdown and suspicions of infidelity.
* Both became isolated and argumentative, with dwindling intimacy since January.
* Financial strain and social conflicts added to stress; he feels controlled and unappreciated.
* Confused about the future, torn between salvaging the relationship and advice from friends to end it.

There is also a CHAt gpt summary of this in the first answer to this question.

Full scenario:I met this girl in my college and we fell hard, both were in relationships which we broke out of eventually because me and her were inseperable.

Now fast forward 4 years later,

A:Where the issues really started-

We happily moved in together and studied hard together to become doctors.due to my weakness in gynecology it took me 3 months more to clear my final exam during which she had already started working as a junior doctor. During these 3 months suddenly the minor issues started to become very big. Since she was working and socialising too and i was just sitting at home doing nothing, studied and gave the exam and while i was just waiting for the result.

B:What were the immediate issues:- 1. She just doesnt talk to me much, and when she talks to me it feels like she is sad, or drainied of energy.

2. I caught her talking to a guy for hours and hours at wee hours of the nights, and when i confronted her she lied about it and denied until she realised that i know and then she just brushed it off as its nothing and he is just another guy friend she talked to because she was bored because i&#x27;m not there to talk anymore. and i caught her talking to the same guy again from 2:45am to 4:30am while she knew i was awake and she denied it again.

3. We both get annoyed very easily and have been fighting a lot. Since I am just waiting for my result and she is doing an internship at a hospital (junior doctor), i drop and pick her up from the hospital everyday (its a 1 hour drive from home to hospital, so 4 hours a day i drive). Its cumbersome but i do it anyway.

4. She doesnt really have much friends, barely 2-4 girls, none of which are entertaining enough to hangout with alot. And while i used to be a social person, but in the last few months i have also become very isolated and secluded. And while anything/everything i do is for/with my partner. Now until i was <mark>forced</mark> to think about it by friends, i think some percent of the reason for me being withdrawn has been the relationship because she lives like this, alone and isolated and now i am living like this, it also lead to me starting to despise some of my friends who i used to hang out with alot because i found out they say crap about me behind my back. As a result of all this mental dilemma we have become trapped inside our own house. We dont even talk as such unless necessary. At times i sit with her for long time and we just dont speak. I do everything she asks for, and due to that it has started to feel like a transaction than a relationship. And i have the burden to make her feel happy.

5.She has grown extremely distant in the last 3-4 months and i have tried to talk to her about it and she just doesnt bother, or want to tell me about whats going on. I have been trying and trying to take care of her and myself but it doesnt seem like its going anywhere, its just the same circle, i try to do things, i try to talk to her, she accepts everything silently saying exactly as much as its necessary, i get annoyed and then get irritated, and then we fight and then we go back to a distant silent phase and repeat. We havent really had any intimacy since january so that is also kind off concerning.

C:Other factors influencing all this-

1. The house we moved into, belongs to my family, so it was just there when we needed it and we slowly started living there. So i bare most of the expenses and she has always been very careless with money, while i am trying to save money she always orders too much shit, which i pay for, as she says she will return it to me later, and then takes months to actually return. While she does return the money 99% of it, but the duration she takes, messess up all my budgeting and savings, so by the time she returns i end up <mark>blow</mark>ing the moeny i saved up to be kept aside as savings.

* Other than the house the car we use is also mine, she doesnt know how to drive yet, i am teaching her. but most of the work to keep everything functioning normal is done by me.

2.She used to hang out with alot of my friends, but with time she has started to kinda dislike (she doesnt say it to my face) almost all of them. And all of my friends have also started to hate her and they keep saying that she is using me. now the friends in question here also are the ones who talk crap behind my back. So i dont know how much can i trust them. But i do feel like they have atleast 1% truth.

3.I have started to feel like there is no respect for me in the relationship. I want to fix things but it feels like all is gone. I am finding it hard because she was supposed to be the one i settle with. I am unable to realise if the relationship is salvageable or not.

4. My whole day feels like I am waiting for her to &#x27;allow&#x27; me to do something. Its not like she doesnt let me do my stuff, its more like everything i do is around her schedule so that what she wants to do, happens. So i keep adjusting others and mine schedule to make sure whatever she says is done. and others hate that.

5. One bad thing about me too, i like to game and when i am gaming i can game for like 4 hours without even coming out of my room at night so she often goes to sleep alone while i game. she doesnt game. And since i have had alot of time recently due to waiting for my results after exams i have been gaming alot too. It also plays a factor. But the distant phase mention in section B point 5 started before i started gaming, so i feel this is not the main reason.

I honestly dont know what to do anymore here. I am confused. And i dont know who to trust or what to do. Its just so hard to think straight because i always thought she will be one i settle with eventually. My friends are asking me to &#x27;be sigma&#x27;and dump her. Never did i ever think i will be thinking like what i am with respect to this girl. We were supposed to be each others end.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">My (F30 tomorrow) and my husband (M30) are in the process of getting divorced.

there is still some talk about whether there is a chance to make it work or not and I&#x27;m all over the place.

this is long, so buckle up :) 

this is my second marriage (his first). I got married for the first time when I was 18 (my ex was 22 at the time) we loved each other very much and he was my best friend. we divorced after 4 years. I grew up very religious orthodox and was very orthodox at that time and he decided he didn&#x27;t want to be religious anymore. (I&#x27;m my religion this is a major lifestyle change so even just technically it&#x27;s hard to maintain mixed marriages). also, he decided he didn&#x27;t want to have kids &quot;in the next 10 years or even ever&quot;. towards the end I agreed to put everything on the table and try to figure out a way of life we are both happy in but he did not agree to go to therapy and we divorced.

I was heartbroken. he was the love of my life and I lost him and all the dreams I had for life with him.

I&#x27;m a strong independent woman and I did everything to build myself back up again. I threw myself into work and studies continued to get my bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees and continued to do my thesis. I did well and even graduated with honors and gave a speech at my master&#x27;s graduation ceremony.

I met my now husband at university. he was very smart, handsome, simple, and emotionally deep person. we connected very quickly and after less than a couple of months we were talking about introducing each other to our families and getting engaged. (it&#x27;s very normal in our community).

when he talked to his parents about us, showed his dad a picture of me and told him of my status his dad was not happy about it. he told him that marrying a divorcee is like getting in someone&#x27;s bed, was very unhappy about it and about how I looked he said &quot;What with that fatty?&quot; (I was overweight and still am but I&#x27;m beautiful). this through him into a bad cycle. he was not able to take the step and get engaged but also did not want to break up. I knew very clearly what I wanted, and I wanted him, so I stayed. I was pretty bad. we did have a great time and connection but every few of weeks I would break down and tell him to make a diction. I tried to break up once but folded very quickly. Now I understand that my confidence and self-value were not in a good place.

A bit more than a year after we started to date he told me that he very much wanted to marry me but my weight and how I look makes it hard for him to accept that that was what his wife would be. It was very hard for me to hear that and he tried not to insult me but it hurt a lot. since I wanted to lose wight as it is and wasn&#x27;t happy with my body I decided to do it. I signed up to a special program and lost 17KG in 3 months and looked amazing.  
a few months later we got married. It was a week before coronavirus broke in our country.

in the beginning, it was fine mostly. he is a critical person so there was a lot of work on communication. we very soon started to have issues in our sex life. mostly me not wanting to and technical issues - the penetration was not easy I would close up and it would be uncomfortable. this has reduced the amount of times we had sex and how &quot;interesting&quot; it was. he was not happy.  
to be honest, in our community people wait till marriage and he had sex twice with one girl before we got married. he was 25.5 at the time, so he came into the marriage with a lot of expectations and it <mark>blow</mark> in his face.  
after about a year and a half of marriage, we decided to go to therapy. It helped and we learned how to communicate better. but other things opened up in therapy that I wasn&#x27;t happy about. generally how he sew the world made me uneasy and specifically his expectations of my role as a wife.

about 2 years after we got married I was diagnosed with vaginismus and a lot of issues that we had, got a name. For anyone who does not know what is it: vaginismus syndrome has a physical and emotional part to it. they influence each other but both need to be treated. the emotional part is when for whatever reason a woman feels like she is shrinking, scared, unsafe, and nervous in a sexual situation and it interferes with the experience. the facial part is that she closes up, it&#x27;s really hard to enter her, and having sex is uncomfortable in good cases, or truly hurts in others to the point where her body closes so much that it&#x27;s impossible to enter.  
uh, and it&#x27;s involuntary, you can&#x27;t control your mussels there. the sad part is that I went to a special clinic when I was 19 since there were some issues in my first marriage too. but not as bad.

as time went by it got bad. since we were already in therapy I tried to go to physical therapy for a few months. One of the things she told me was to stop trying to force it in cuz this is one of the things that makes it worse. so when my body says no, it&#x27;s a no.  
he got even more frustrated. I tried to do some of the exercises with him as recommended, but he wasn&#x27;t there, he tried this as &quot;my issue that I need to fix&quot; and &quot;wanted to see me put some effort into fixing it before he could join&quot;. after a few months in physical therapy, I stopped. I felt like I was trying to force my body to change, I wasn&#x27;t ready for it emotionally and I was doing it for him and my heart was not into it.

I want to mention a few things:

[1.My](http://1.My) husband was sexually assaulted as a kid. no one knew about it and it wasn&#x27;t treated. to this day he does not like to talk about it or tie it to anything that he is. he is in denial that this affected him and shaped his life.

2. He might sound pretty bad but he had really good heart. he tried a lot as much as he could.

so, a year ago (married for 3 years at the time) I found out how he was coping with the lack of sex. I found his old phone active and on. when I went in I found a ton of porn, mostly real women and not models, dating apps, fake accounts, and about 100 chats where he is sexting with another woman, some of them got to a point of setting a time and place to meet (he says he never did). as a cherry on top, in one of the chats he speaks about my little sister in a sexual way, and explains what he likes about her body act.  my sister is skinny and innocent. this killed me. I wanted to throw him out. what the hell did he do in therapy for the past year??

this threw me into a pretty bad place and a life crisis. how the hell did I get here?  
the only reason I didn&#x27;t break it off right there was the fact that our therapist convinced me to wait with the decision and not make it from anger and hurt but try to let the motions die a little and make the decision from a more level-headed place.  
at this point, I demanded to see him make a reel effort to save the marriage. he looked for a therapist that was specialized in addiction to porn and I went to someone that specialized in vaginismus.

things died down since then. we found a way to move forward somehow, each one of us working on his issues. we haven&#x27;t had sex since that (yes, a year!) we tried but it didn&#x27;t work. he developed erectile problems from &quot;being rejected all the time&quot; and with my vaginismus, it just didn&#x27;t work. but we figured out a way to be friends again so that level was still there.

a few weeks ago he came to me and said that he does not believe that we will be able to me it works again. if I have an idea that can convince him he will listen but he thinks that the way we are going we should start separating.  
It hurt, a lot, I was still in a place to try to stay and make it work. after a few days, I started to focus on life after.

when I talked to my parents my dad asked if he could speak to him and me and see if he could offer a solution, I agreed, these talks have been happening in the past week and for now, there isn&#x27;t much of a change.  
about twice a day I decide that I&#x27;m done and then we keep talking about it and I want to see where it can go.

I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;m doing the same thing as when we were dating and waiting for him to make the decision or that the fact that I truly believe in a process just makes me not know when to quit. there is still a tiny bit of hope that it will work and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m toying with myself.  
I know I could be happy by myself but I&#x27;m scared.

thank you for reading all the way here. just telling this story made me feel better.  
would love to hear your thoughts.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for 5 years.

This was my first proper relationship, but she has had multiple relationships before me, the longest lasting 3 years.

I dont know if there&#x27;s a way to write this post in a non biased way without writing a whole book explaining our life stories.. nor do I know what the purpose of writing this even is, I guess I&#x27;m just trying to get some stuff off my chest during a rough time...

I like to think I&#x27;m emotionally mature, in reality I don&#x27;t think I could be labeled as that as I do have ADHD and a good amount of emotional dysregulation and anger issues. But I like to &#x27;think&#x27; I am or at least strive to be, because regardless of my issues I do know how a normal person should behave even if I struggle to behave like that, I always strive to be better and only do things with good intentions. I try not to make excuses for myself, I know when I do things that are wrong, I just sometimes don&#x27;t know how to do the right thing in a way that doesn&#x27;t come across as wrong.

Ever since me and my girlfriend met I&#x27;ve been telling her - lets be honest to each other, if there are any problems, you can tell me and we can talk about it, communication is key. I always believed all problems can be solved through talking.

But, even after 5 years it&#x27;s as if she never understood what any of that meant..

We started arguing quite a lot a few months after we started dating, mostly because of petty little things. She&#x27;d be dishonest about something, I&#x27;d find out she wasn&#x27;t honest and it&#x27;d set me off on a rant complaining about honesty for way too long. For example a common theme at the start was her talking to her ex she dated for 3 years. I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with that as long as it wasn&#x27;t cheating, and what she spoke to her ex about was certainly not cheating, her ex was in a commited relationship as well. I knew an emotionally mature person would say that&#x27;s fine and it was fine to me, I let her know it&#x27;s fine, but she&#x27;d still go and hide that she was talking to them and would lie saying she isn&#x27;t... Like why? I told you its okay multiple times, you don&#x27;t have to be dishonest about it, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen, we talk about it like adults and that&#x27;s it?

Most of our arguments she&#x27;d shut down as well and not say a single thing, it&#x27;d be like me complaining to a wall, she would never say she has any issues about me, nothing at all which set me on a tunnel visioned path of even more complaining and failing to comprehend how hard it could be to just talk. A lot of the time I&#x27;d say and beg &quot;if you could just talk to me we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess&quot;, sometimes even begging her to tell me something I did wrong and I&#x27;d want her to get upset at me for once so it wasnt so one sided, but that never happened.

I never wanted to be in those arguments, looking back yes it was toxic behaviour from both of us, especially me, and if we argued about such stupid stuff why were we even together?

We stayed together because the times that we didn&#x27;t argue which were the majority of the time everything felt perfect, so many times we said how great the other person is, it was everything we could&#x27;ve asked for. She was and still is the kindest person I know deep down. We had so many common interests, so many happy memories, so whilst the bad things were <mark>blow</mark>n out of proportion, in the end it was all mostly okay.

Things got better throughout the years, we&#x27;d still argue about some of the same issues but we seemed to argue less.

She struggled with mental health just like me, not diagnosed with anything, but she strongly believed she might have autism and was on a waiting list for diagnosis. She&#x27;s had a lot of trauma in her childhood from bullying at school and even at home because of an alcoholic step dad, she struggled to keep a job for longer than a few months and got diagnosed with some physical problems too like IIH migraines. I tried my best to support her, I researched what we could do to relieve her stress and migraines, how we could get a job for her that she would be happy in, etc.

I saw myself in her as I know how big of a struggle it is to achieve stuff in life when you have problems setting you back. I myself didn&#x27;t get a proper job until 3 years into the relationship. Then she finally got a job she has been in for about a year now too.

Things were starting to look good, we fought so hard throughout the years to live a better life together and we were finally starting to achieve that, we had money we could spend to go and do things, etc.

Except.. we still had our petty arguments and whilst they did get better for some time, they got worse again. It was exhausting for both of us, I was still mostly the same complaining about the same stuff, she was mostly the same shutting down and making me feel like I&#x27;m not being listened to.

Now this is the part which I regret the most that I&#x27;m very conflicted by and embarrassed of.. during some arguments things would get heated and I&#x27;d end up raising my voice and saying nasty things to get a reaction out of her because it was always so one sided.. I also did things to control her

I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m abusive, I don&#x27;t really understand my actions, I never wanted to be like this, I&#x27;ve questioned myself and read posts online to try and understand what the hell am I, but I just don&#x27;t know

For example something controlling and abusive I did was only a few weeks ago.. she had plans to go out with her work friends after work, which I truly didn&#x27;t have a problem with, I was happy for her to go out, she hasn&#x27;t been going out much and I always thought it would help us having some time away from each other.

I said to her okay, but please don&#x27;t get home too late and don&#x27;t drink much. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with alcohol and drugs in the past, nothing to do with the relationship, just personally it would make me feel terrible so I quit it altogether 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t been <mark>drunk</mark> since. Because of her physical problems and mental problems she has to take quite a few medications throughout the day and we always agreed she wouldn&#x27;t drink much because of it, in case the alcohol triggers any flare ups or interacts with her medication.

She agreed to this, but when the day came she left work at 6pm and only got home at 12am, I could immediately tell she was <mark>drunk</mark> so I asked her how much she drank. This time she was more honest with me (she was genuinely trying to improve in being honest, this wasnt just the alcohol making her more open) and said she had multiple vodkas, plus a few other drinks, as well as at least 6+ shots, or in her words &quot;so many I can&#x27;t remember, my friends were just handing them to me and I didnt refuse&quot;.

I don&#x27;t know if I was being unreasonable, but to me getting home around 12am is late and drinking that much alcohol is a lot... which is the opposite of what we agreed on.. now I regret what happened next because she was fine, the alcohol didn&#x27;t interact with her and she was okay even the next day, but I felt like she didn&#x27;t listen to something so simple again which set me off on another <mark>blow</mark>n out of proportion rant towards her

But this time it escalated and I blew up at her saying no more going out, she either doesn&#x27;t go out anymore as she is clearly irresponsible with alcohol or we can break up, I regretted saying it in the moment as I knew immediately that sort of shit is toxic, but in the moment my judgment was clouded by my anger and I just wanted the best for her. I was thinking &quot;but what if the alcohol did react poorly and you didnt listen to me?&quot; I didnt want anything bad happening to her... I felt like I was being disrespected

This wasn&#x27;t the first time I did something like this when I felt like I wasn&#x27;t being listened to. Another example would be her playing online games with her friends, which was fine, I&#x27;m a gamer myself, but a lot of the time I felt like gaming for her was a higher priority than our relationship.

Multiple times we argued about it and I tried to tell her how I felt, but things didn&#x27;t really change, which led to me <mark>blow</mark>ing up and telling her she can&#x27;t use the PS5 which I bought with my own money, I then went and deleted her account and games off of it as a punishment

None of this lasted very long though which is where I&#x27;m conflicted as to who I truly am and what my intentions are.. I never enjoyed doing any of this, I hated seeing her cry, immediately after this happened, every time I&#x27;d regret it. I&#x27;d try and remain stern though hoping it would bring a needed change to our relationship, maybe I&#x27;d finally be listened to.. I&#x27;d always give in in a few days as I couldn&#x27;t stand acting like that and things would go back to normal. I&#x27;d say things like &quot;PS5 I bought with my money&quot; but that was just to get a reaction, I never tried to control her money, she had her own bank and I had mine, if she needed money I&#x27;d give her it every time she asked, I never refused or took anything rightfully hers away from her

Even with the going out with her work friends thing a few weeks ago.. she told me she was invited to go out again this Thursday and whilst at first I reminded her what I said would happen, she said fine she won&#x27;t go out, within a few minutes I gave in and said &quot;okay I&#x27;m not being serious, you can go out, but please please just don&#x27;t drink too much&quot;.

She went out again, I had no problem with it, she got home a lot earlier and said she didn&#x27;t drink alcohol, I could tell she didn&#x27;t, but even if she was lying I believed her and said &quot;thank you, I&#x27;m glad you had a great day&quot;. That&#x27;s all I ever wanted.. there was no argument, no miscommunication, I was truly happy

I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m an abuser trying to justify my actions or if deep down I&#x27;m a good person that does things that come across the wrong way like I try to make myself believe..

Now I&#x27;m writing this because she acted like everything was fine, we woke up yesterday like we normally do, watched some funny videos, she had plans to go out to see her friend at 12pm and she would stay there overnight. Fine by me, I&#x27;m slightly ill and didn&#x27;t want to go out and we needed groceries so decided to order some before she left, she picked something she wanted, we watched more funny videos and as 12pm came round I hugged her, kissed her goodbye, did our little bye bye ritual, and she left..

Everything was fine, or so it seemed.. until I received a text about half an hour after she left saying she cannot do this anymore and is breaking up with me.. I tried talking to her but she said &quot;I&#x27;ll be back with my friends at 8pm to get some of my stuff and then I&#x27;ll be gone forever&quot; and blocked me. Now this sent me into a panic, this felt so unreal, I tried texting her family and friends to see if it was indeed real and to make sure nothing bad actually happened to her.. yes it was real

After talking to some of her friends she unblocked me and I tried talking to her, but she was just refusing it completely this time. She said we would talk in a few days.. 8pm came around, I packed some stuff she requested and put it outside her door for her to grab, she said she didnt want to see me so I respected it and stayed inside.. and now I&#x27;m here stuck in this situation

Normally during our arguments she only ever talks through text, if we are arguing in person she rarely ever says anything or voices any issues. This time she didn&#x27;t want to talk through text either.

I honestly don&#x27;t know how to feel. It&#x27;s clear she has been talking to her friends, instead of me about all our issues, she&#x27;s always screenshoted our arguments and &quot;aired the dirty laundry&quot; to her friends which I mentioned is a problem, but I never tried to control who she&#x27;s friends and most of the time we made up and tried to move on...

I don&#x27;t know if I have the right to feel hurt, my emotions are all over the place right now and this feels like betrayal. I feel like she has done a lot of things that were wrong, especially how she decided to end things by acting like everything is fine then leaving and breaking up over text instead of simply talking to me. I feel upset she would talk to her friends and let her know such personal details, but then again maybe it was justified because of my controlling actions.. even though she did a lot of these things way before I did anything controlling..

I feel like she is a good person but has painted a bad picture of me to her friends which has led her friends to influence her decisions based on a one sided story...

None of this makes much sense to me right now, I never tried to control her so I could have power over her, I never <mark>forced</mark> her to stay with me, regardless of all the things that happened between us I tried my best to improve and do things differently and see her for the good person she is. I made it clear if we ever break up I want to break up in a calm way, I just want to talk and communicate, I said how I believe most things don&#x27;t last forever and that it&#x27;s okay if things go wrong, but we need to at least try if we want to make this work..

I want to believe that everything I&#x27;ve done I did because I loved the person she is 90% of the time, I just wanted her to reciprocate and try to improve how she is during the other 10% as I&#x27;ve been trying to improve myself. I feel like I&#x27;ve sacrificed a lot for her but she hasn&#x27;t done much for me.. no one is perfect and I had good hopes for both of us.

And now the past 5 years feel like a waste. I don&#x27;t know why we couldnt avoid this mess.. mostly everything was great apart from our petty arguments

I now just wish I could go back in time and not argue, I wish I could&#x27;ve just let her be who she is and ignore all of those stupid little things because I was genuinely happy. I don&#x27;t want us to split apart without trying one last time.. I know I can&#x27;t force her and I don&#x27;t want to, it just hurts so much seeing the potential and have it be destroyed just like that.

Is there any way to salvage this..</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">My boyfriend&#x27;s IRL group of friends hates me. They think I&#x27;m a bad influence on him and they think he&#x27;s whipped even though I did nothing. I&#x27;m currently dating my boyfriend for 1 year now. This is gonna be a bit long but there will be a TLDR dont worry.

Before, my boyfriend would spend a lot of time with them and hang out around them a lot. They would play valorant together everyday and just hang out. But now when me and my boyfriend got together, he spend less time with his friends and prefers to be with me instead. I didn&#x27;t force him to stay with me but we just really like being together. His friends would throw shades at him and say things like &quot;His addicted to p\*ssy now he already forgot about his homies&quot; and it&#x27;s not really nice. They think I&#x27;m controlling and is forcing my boyfriend to be with me even though I didn&#x27;t.. he just really likes to be with me. Sometimes when he join their discord vc they would ignore him or say mean things to him like &quot;P\*ssy addict&quot; or something like that. So he tries to manage his time better to be with me and also play games or just hang out with his friends.

This situation is kinda messed up and I feel like I did something wrong but I actually didn&#x27;t or maybe I did, any thoughts?

Here are some more info about this situation:

* My boyfriend would defend me saying that it&#x27;s not true he just likes to be with me.
* He used to be a very heavy smoker but he quit because of me. I don&#x27;t like smokers and it&#x27;s kind of a dealbreaker for me plus it would hurt me to see someone that I love smoke which technically ruin your health.
* He also became a better person overall, he used to skip lessons most of the time but ever since we became a couple he focus on his study more and got a much better GPA.
* He&#x27;s became more reasonable and more mature when he&#x27;s with me
* My boyfriend and I have a really amazing and a healthy relationship (it wasn&#x27;t before due to his friends but it is now)
* Most of his friends are virgin and single (they have been in a relationship though)
* My boyfriend sometimes <mark>blow</mark> them off but whenever he make time for them they never really appreciate it
* They would ignore him sometimes and not invite to do things with them in their own groupchat

**Why they almost ruined our relationship**

1. They encourage him to smoke.

*more info:*

-&gt;  One time while my boyfriend was trying to quit smoking. One of his friend said shit like &quot;You can&#x27;t quit man&quot; and hand him vape. (note: it had only been 3 days since he quit so he&#x27;s in a period where his brain was really struggling and need nicotine) which made him fail. My boyfriend apparently told me a false info he told me his friend shoved vape in his mouth but the truth is his friend handed him the vape I learnt that later.

That made me really angry but I tried to keep my  composure and decided to try and talk out with the guy who made him smoke directly via chat. I pretend I didn&#x27;t know it was him and asked him if my boyfriend smoke that one day and his friend lied to me saying that he didn&#x27;t. And I casually said &quot;Ok, well I trust you with my boyfriend. He&#x27;s currently trying to cut smoking so I hope you take care of him well.&quot; I&#x27;m pretty sure that spooked him. Many people didn&#x27;t like this guy for a reason so one time when he did an NGL on Instagram (basically a Q&amp;A thing) someone sent him an anonymous text &quot;Fucking asshole shoved cigarettes in people&#x27;s mouth&quot;. This gossip has been going around and I was confuse because only me and my trusted group of friends knows about this. But I later realised that my friend told other people. so now the guy thought I was the one who wrote that text which wasn&#x27;t true. and now the group dislikes me even more.    (Although my boyfriend did defend me and said there&#x27;s no way I would have wrote that. It probably was someone from the party) After this accident they ignored him for a couple of months

-&gt; When he had already cut off nicotine,vaping,smoking cigarettes his friends would encourage him to go back to smoking at the party and get <mark>drunk</mark>. Which I&#x27;m heavily against. Since I&#x27;m against it his friends thinks I&#x27;m controlling, that kind of makes me really upset since all I wanted was the best for him and my boyfriend had openly communicate to me that he&#x27;s not uncomfortable doing this for me because he knows it&#x27;s also good for his own health too.

  2. They send him half-naked girls from social media that we almost broke up.

*more info:*

-&gt; While, yes it is typically normal for guys to send half-naked girls from social media but I think it&#x27;s not really ok to consume this type of content while you&#x27;re already in a relationship. It&#x27;s just another way how you show respect. Also I&#x27;m insecure too whenever my partner view this type of content. Ever since we got together I always communicate clearly that I would heavily dislike it if he view pictures or reels of girls clearly doing provocative stuff and being half naked so I asked him politely to refrain from doing it. Also if I were to do it, it would make him insecure and dislike it as well. But sometimes during our relationship he would sometimes break this compromise/promise that we made and would have several fights about it. He would say &quot;this is just how I am&quot; and I would start to worry if I&#x27;m too much so I try my best to not think much whenever he consume this type of content but in the end I just can&#x27;t handle it because it makes me feel insecure and not respected y&#x27;know? because I don&#x27;t even look at guys for him, there&#x27;s no need for me to look at them either, I love doing this for him because I know it makes me feel more ease and not insecure, so It was just unfair. My boyfriend open up and try to not view half naked girls on social media which made us fight way more less and our relationship was definitely more happy than before. His social media feed had less half naked girls

Until one day, I asked him if he had been looking at girls on social media lately, he denied no. It made him pause for a sec then he confessed that he&#x27;s been looking at them sometime if they ever pop up in his feed. That obviously made me upset. But I hope it was just normal girls because if that was the case then I wouldn&#x27;t be upset at all but if it were half naked girls doing provocative stuff like dancing to sexy song on tiktok and wearing just lingerie THAT would have made me upset. When I asked him if it were half naked girls he look at he confessed that it was but he would only watch it if it pop up in his feed. I was really sad but I could handle it.

**But what I couldn&#x27;t really handle was, his friend purposely sending him these shit when he told them several times he doesn&#x27;t want it and I wouldn&#x27;t be ok with it either.**

I got really upset at my boyfriend when he confessed that his friends has been sending him pictures of these kind of girls to him. And we broke up once because there was a misunderstanding about him asking for it himself but I later learnt that it wasn&#x27;t true. My boyfriend later confront his friend that it&#x27;s his fault for sending these things to him when he had clearly told his friend he doesn&#x27;t like it. His friend later denies that it was his fault and should have differentiate whose fault it was properly because he didn&#x27;t do anything.

(But throughout the entirety of our relationship of 1 year, his friend has been sending this from the start till our 1 year anniversary so that should already say enough on its own how much he sent)

His friend asked him &quot;What? so it&#x27;s not ok to send?&quot; and he proceed to tell me that I&#x27;m too much, too much the point I have to break up with him because of this. He told my boyfriend he thinks a girl is more important than his homies. He also didn&#x27;t comfort my boyfriend while we broke up and write shady stuff on instagram notes saying things like &quot;nobody is a saint more than you are, fucking saint&quot;. He also wrote on his private acc on instagram saying &quot;If love is going to ruin you as a person like this better than not have any&quot;.

  3.  They encourage him to make a secret private account to follow p\*rn stars.

(no anymore info, should already says enough)

  
  4.  They try to make me look bad while they spend time together saying &quot;Look at your girlfriend, that&#x27;s kinda too much no? you should spend more time together with your homies&quot; but to my boyfriend&#x27;s defends he said that he just enjoy being with me and I wasn&#x27;t really forcing him





TLDR:  
My boyfriend&#x27;s friends hates me for apparently no reason and I&#x27;m not sure why since I made him a better person even his mom likes me seeing how much he has changed for the better. But somehow his friends hates me so much. Could it be because of the time spent together? smoking? or the looking at girls? any thoughts?</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">i’m (20F) am giving up on my two year relationship with my boyfriend (20M). We met at university first year and had your classic friends to lovers cliche storyline. He’s my best friend and the someone who I thought would be my soulmate. I love him with all my heart and it causes me so much pain to hurt his feelings. We’ve been super in love ever since we started dating but the biggest problem that’s always been an issue is his mom who i believe is bipolar and abusive. I’ve suffered emotionally and mentally due to this and i’ve always tried to justify it due to my love for him. 

Last summer his mother messaged me and said I had disrespected his family and was a bad influence to her son, saying a bunch of stuff that didn’t make sense. My boyfriend said that his mom did this because she was angry at him, and wanted to project that anger onto someone which happened to be me. I lost my appetite, kept vomiting for a week and didn’t have my period for 2 months because of those hurtful messages, but I still chose to stay in the relationship because I loved him. 

There were a lot of instances his mom would be over controlling and <mark>blow</mark> up at him, telling him to go home immediately and yell at him. I felt so worried and bad that happened and I couldn’t do anything about it. His mom is extremely religious and due to our religious differences has asked me to convert and also showed disapproval of our relationship. I have talked to my boyfriend about this and we have mutual respect for each others beliefs, and he has never <mark>forced</mark> me to convert or anything. 

Besides his mom, i’ve come to realize that we are currently worlds apart in terms of family relationships and financial status. I realize that I live a way more privileged life than him, but I wanted to provide him with mental and emotional support because he has to deal with the financial and family issues. However, in the process of trying to do this I have also made myself miserable. I would sacrifice the world to keep him, but I think doing so would make me destroy my mental health. 

This relationship really made me realize the pain of right person wrong circumstances, and I really wish that it would hurt less. I want to know what I can do now to help him with his family situation and how I can help myself at the same time. I feel as if I am staying in this relationship out of worry and guilt for him instead of being happy with him. I feel like I’ve just been in denial because I keep focusing on the happiness he brings me while ignoring all the pain that he’s caused.  

My boyfriend is a really kind and empathetic person but I feel as though he will never escape his mom’s abuse, nor can he defend me when it comes to his mother. I feel so sorry watching him be so helpless, but I also can’t be the person to change his mind about giving into his mother. I decided I would not come between him and his mother no matter how much I loved or cared for him, so I am letting go of my best friend and favorite person. 

**TL;DR**: Giving up on someone who I believe is my soulmate because of our circumstantial differences and his toxic family issues. I feel selfish for wanting to leave this relationship because i am leaving my boyfriend to fight his own battle. </div>

&amp;#x200B;

Well, sort of good news first, I went to a psychiatrist after a lot of probing from both the people in my life and people online who recommended I try therapy. And after a couple of sessions I was diagnosed with BPD along with a Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I’m not going to lie and say I took it well. I screamed and cried and threw things around and it took my boyfriend, my guardian and adopted father James along with the psychiatrist to calm me down after about an hour of me just yelling at everyone around me. I even tried to climb out of the window but given the room was on the fourth floor of the building, I don’t think I would have made it far. It took about 3 guys to hold me down and sedate me. I was put on some meds right after and there were even talks about having me committed but they decided to wait until a few more days or weeks to see if I got worse. They said that the antidepressant will take a few weeks to fully work but that the Xanax should work really quickly after taking it. Bad news, combined they make really fucking sleepy and tired and after what happened, I was knocked out for a good day and woke up like half and hour ago. I’m also sort of documentation everything here so that I can remember what happened to this best of my abilities because these fucking meds are also going to mess with my memory so I am really not winning at life right now. I feel sort of numb and tired and I can’t even tell if it’s because of the meds or my apparently numerous mental issues but it will take about a month to see. I’m taking at least a few weeks off of college to figure this out and there’s nothing for me to do but ride it out I guess. I’m trying to learn about what I have but all I know is what I managed to retain by quizzing my friend who’s studying to be a psychiatrist. I’m a fucking English Literature major with a minor in Journalism and all these big words are hurting my head. I don’t think I’ll be very coherent but honestly, my mind is somehow the sharpest when I’m writing so this is the best it’s going to get.​

&amp;#x200B;

But that being said, that’s not the whole reason why I posted again. Anyone with a working brain could figure out I had issues so I don’t think anyone’s going to be super surprised that I was diagnosed with something so quickly. Maybe not the specifics but that’s not the reason I posted. My bio dad, who I’m going to call DH (short for Dick Head) because that asshole doesn’t deserve to be called my father. That’s going to James from now on. Seeing on paper how badly my childhood screwed me up because of him just confirmed that I never want to see him again. I hope I maintain this position after my mind has cleared a bit but right now, I hate him. I hate him like I’ve never hated anyone before and for good reason. I didn’t even get to tell him that, since I’ve barely been able to string along a coherent sentence but James did and from what I know it didn’t go good. James even had to tell DH that if he ever tried to come near me again, he’d get a restraining order and that anything that happened to him on our property would be considered self defence.​

&amp;#x200B;

Well, DH never tried to contact me again but he did tell his own family about me, just as one last ‘fuck you’ before he left again. His family is apparently incredibly abusive and horrible, to everyone in it. His spite or whatever was stronger than his feelings towards the very same people who abused him. They ruined his life and he was more than okay with them ruining mine even more than it already is. He tried to leave me with them before, when I was like 7 or 8 but I threw the biggest tantrum ever and he was <mark>forced</mark> to keep me with him. The reason why I threw the tantrum was because when we reached their house, I could hear a woman or a child screaming for help in the house along with things breaking and yelling about some other stuff. It scared me so much, I refused to get out of the car and even tried to run away from him when he tried to drag me to the house. He gave up and took me home and then left a couple months later for good. He even told me how horrible they were to him growing up and he still told them about me.They showed up at my home and thank the stars James was there because I was not in the right state to handle them. I was literally rotting on the couch in the living room trying not to fall asleep at 12 in the afternoon when they came. James wanted to close the door on them but they managed to make their way in after saying they just wanted to meet me. I tried to be present for the conversation but I was honestly having an out of body experience the whole time and was more focused on the show playing on the TV than what they were saying but I did pick up some stuff.​

&amp;#x200B;

Like 5 of them came, and apparently, it’s a whole blended family. Aunts, cousins and uncles all living together in a giant house left behind by some ancestor. They are decently well-off but not to the same level James is. I can’t fully remember but I think there was a cousin just a bit older than me, another who was a whole decade older than me and an aunt and two uncles. I’ve literally never met these people in my life and they were acting so concerned over me. James made sure none of them sat close to me and told them that they had 10 minutes to make their sales pitch and then leave. The older uncle said that DH had told them about me for the first time and wanted to meet me. The aunt chimed in saying something about how tall I was for a girl but that was the only time I spoke when I told her I was a boy. She laughed and said that DH never said if I was a boy or girl and that they couldn’t tell with my hair. I just sunk further into the blanket and let James handle the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

​Basically, DH leaving them was a massive <mark>blow</mark> to their ego and ‘family pride’ and if they could get his kid back into the fold, it would prove they weren’t terrible people who abuse their own children. As you can guess, James was not the biggest fan of the idea that I go and live with them because ‘they’re family’ and ‘they needed to take care of me since I was obviously not doing well’. Well, after one of the cousins, the older one I think, made a comment about ‘exotic’ I look (I’m mixed race with my mom having Japanese and Chinese heritage) which did give me shivers even with how detached I was from the entire conversation, James got ready to kick them out. They were making some really creepy comments towards me the entire time and when one of them tried to touch me, James had to physically push them out. He said he made a mistake letting them in and he’s going to do his best to rectify that and learn from it going on. They’re basically on the No Contact List along with DH now. I was half asleep at this point and there was yelling about how he can’t keep me away from family and that I ‘needed to be fixed’. Whether they were talking about my blatant homosexuality or my slowly but steadily declining mental state is yet to be confirmed but fingers crossed, I never talk with them again to find out. I could hear them from outside the gates about how James has ‘turned me to his disgusting ways and turned me against my own blood. James was fully ready to call the cops when they left and asked if I wanted pizza after. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, my mind is fucked, my biological father is a piece of shit (surprise surprise) and his family are a bunch of child abusing, molesting, homophobic freaks who think that I want to live with them. I’m don&#x27;t, incase that wasn’t insanely obvious.My biggest problem now is that I don’t think any of the people are going to be happy with my decision to never want to have a relationship with any of them again. The fact that DH is talking to his family about me again pisses me off even more and they do have a lot of influence (how none of them have ever gone to prison before as far as I can tell), and combined with how messed up I am, I’m vaguely concerned that they might pull some shit to get to me. I’m half considering making them all sit down in a restaurant and giving a powerpoint presentation on why I wouldn’t even trust them to take care of a turnip and that I have no interest in any of them. None of them seem like they would respect my wishes to just be left alone if I told them nicely so I don&#x27;t know at this point. I just need some advice on how to deal with them going forward, like let them tire themselves out or just outright try to block them from my life?</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17ewza3/fiancé_25f_is_angry_with_me_26m_because_she_feels/" target="_blank" class="title">Fiancé (25F) is angry with me (26M) because she feels like I am not on her side when it comes to my family. How do I show her that isn&#x27;t the case?</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Really not sure how to go about this so I guess I’ll just try to start from the beginning and if anyone has any questions I’ll be happy to try to answer them. Buckle up, this is a long dysfunctional one that I probably should have posted here months ago before it got this bad.

TL;DR: My mother and fiancé don’t get along, mom said some pretty terrible things, I was caught in the middle and now my fiancé feels like I don’t support her enough. My request is the last paragraph – please help me figure out how to show her that I am on her side for the long haul.

  
My Fiancé (F25) and I (M26) have been together for a little over two years. We met in college before COVID, stayed in touch through the pandemic, and after work brought us to the same city, started dating in 2021. This is my first relationship outside of high school that has lasted more than 3-4 months.  
I’m an only child, and my mother was a stay-at-home-mom, so she and I have always been pretty close. My mother has always been a pretty opinionated person. She got it from my grandmother and is the kind of person who likes to tell you *what* to do and *how* you should do things *her way* and won’t drop it if you don’t agree. This has led to numerous arguments between her and her family that I remember growing up. As I got older in high school and college, she and I would get into similar arguments if I knew that I was clearly right about something, with her saying how I just ‘always wanted to debate with her’ since I was on the debate team. If proved wrong, she would never apologize and just brush the argument off, pretending like she had not done anything wrong. If I was wrong, however, I never got to live it down and would be reminded about how she knew what she was talking about. This is how she is with just about anyone.

I have since learned to prevent arguments by changing how I speak to her, since it is just easier for all involved as I had determined that she would not change. Also, she is one to expect someone to make a big deal about things that she has done for people. For example, if she were to pay for dinner, a simple “thank you” is not showing enough appreciation for her, she expects *recognition*.

  
My Fiancé has a pretty strong personality but is also quite shy around people who she is not comfortable with. This combination can make her come across as aloof to people who don’t know her well. She also has grown up in a family that places strong emphasis on calling each other out when they disagree and so she can be quick to correct people if she knows they are wrong or disagrees with them. As you can see, this would make her and my mother like oil and water.  
This has led to my mother disliking my fiancé ‘for me’ from the beginning of our relationship because she determined early on for herself that she is ‘cold and abrasive’. (ex. &quot;I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s a *bad* person, I just didn&#x27;t think you would want to be with someone who does things like that.&quot;)

From the beginning, my mother would be quick to point out any small perceived flaw she could find in my (at the time girlfriend) to me. (Ex. “why can’t she be this way?”; “Why does she always have to do\_\_\_?”; “She didn’t thank me for the present I got her!”) She would never say these flaws to my girlfriend’s face, but instead would disapprovingly say them to me.

  
This is where my first screwup was. At the early points in our relationship, some of these things my mom pointed out to me were personality traits that I had noticed also. Some of them slightly irritated me in day-to-day life, but were things I could get over or didn’t think really mattered in the grand scheme of things relating to our relationship. For example, gf’s tendency to correct people. Sometimes it would be a little annoying, but I could let her know that I appreciated her input but wished that she would be a little nicer about it. One could say she lacks bedside manner. I knew that it wasn’t necessarily her trying to be a know-it-all, but instead just who she was and accepted it. For some reason though, the constant pointing it out by my mom frustrated me to the point that I brought it up with my girlfriend, saying things like “the next time we hang out with my family, could you maybe be a little more conscious of correcting people?” or &quot;Did you make sure to thank my mom for that?&quot;

I became hyper-conscious of some of the things that mildly irritated me when we were with my family. Instead of just telling my mother “that’s just who she is, you will have to deal with it&quot;, I found myself relaying her complaints to my girlfriend, to the point that she would ask me after a visit with my family “what did she have to critique about me this time?”  
During our first year of dating, my fiancé tragically lost her father to cancer. One weekend when he was sick and in a hospital 4 hours away with 1-visitor-per-day COVID protocols, my mother called me and not knowing she was on speakerphone with my girlfriend in the room, started to complain that it was ‘so wrong of her to not be visiting him’ and how she ‘couldn’t believe he wasn’t important enough to her’. (Not that she could have seen him anyhow, since her mom was at the hospital with him and thus the 1 visitor for the day). That was one of the first times she heard what my mom truly thought not relayed by me. I was honestly in shock that my mom would say such a thing and hurriedly ended the call. I really didn’t know what to do, because any opposition to my mother’s opinion always led to a fight.

My fiancé considers herself a people pleaser with anxiety, and hearing my mother say things like this didn’t help her mental state. From then on she would second guess everything she did around my parents, and doing anything with them was emotionally rough on her. We try to split time visiting her family and my family evenly (they both live in cities roughly equidistant from us, \~3 hours away). My family started pointing out ‘how much time we were spending with her family’ and how it ‘felt like they never saw us anymore’. Her mother did the same thing if we went more than a month or so without seeing her. Over the next year we averaged seeing both of our families one weekend a month, so it didn’t leave us a ton of time for our personal lives either, adding more stress to our relationship. Once her father passed, we understandably took more trips to go spend time with her mother and help her clear out and sell the house, and move.

Things first came to a head over Christmas last year. Gf’s family likes to take cruises, while my family has never been on one. We went on the cruise with her family, and while my parents were invited to come, they declined. We spent the week before Christmas on the cruise, returning on Christmas eve and driving to spend the actual holiday with my side of the family (including aunts and uncles in the town my parents live in). However, we had to leave the 26th to drive home because although I had the week off from work, girlfriend had to be back at work on the 27th.  
The original plan had been for my parents to follow us back to our place and spend the week with us, so we could spend time together while gf was at work during the day. The morning of the 26th, my parents asked why I didn’t just stay at their place for another day or two, while my girlfriend could go back to work and they would drive me back in a few days. This led to a fight because my girlfriend wasn’t comfortable going home by herself right after Christmas when it was the first Christmas she was not spending with her family, and the first Christmas without her father. My parents were frustrated because they felt that we had &#x27;just spent a week on a cruise with her family&#x27; but could &#x27;only spend two nights with them&#x27;, and that they never got to spend ‘1-on-1’ time with me anymore. My mother said some things to her like “if you can’t handle going home alone the day after Christmas then you obviously need therapy!”. My girlfriend left the room crying and I didn’t do a great job of chastising my mother for her behavior. I ended up going back home with my girlfriend, but she was frustrated that I would even consider letting her leave by herself, and my parents were frustrated that I went with her.  
Over the following months, I had some serious conversations with my mother about how I planned to propose to my girlfriend and how I loved her, and that was all that should matter. I thought things were getting better as we spent some weekends with them in the spring and summer with no major issues. During this time I also planned to have both of our families present at the engagement when I popped the question (another mistake, that started out as a kind offer from my dad to take pictures to save me having to pay for a photographer, and leading to my mom getting invited, and then gf&#x27;s family as well).

  
About 6 weeks before the engagement, my mother was visiting us for a few days over her birthday. My father was on a work trip, so we wanted my mom to not have to be alone for her birthday, which was in the middle of the week hence her staying with us. After spending the afternoon going to a winery and coming back and having a drink before dinner, my mother was a little tipsy. We were cooking thinly sliced beef for dinner, and when I pulled it out of the fridge my mother said “that looks like tartare!” My girlfriend corrected her and said something along the lines of “I thought tartare was chopped up? Aren&#x27;t thin slices called something else?” And proceeded to google it. (For those of you wondering, the answer is carpaccio).  
My mother lost it. She blew up, saying how wrong it is to correct people all the time and how she can’t stand how bad of an influence my girlfriend and her family are in my life. She tried packing her bags and leaving then and there, but I wouldn’t let her drive since she had been drinking. This led to 3 hours of back and forth between calling my girlfriend names, to saying how she was just trying to save me from this relationship, to saying how for her entire life people have been against her. My girlfriend left the room but heard much of this from the other room, until she finally decided to go out for a walk. Eventually, I let my mother leave after she had sobered up.

  
We didn’t speak for a few days, and it was only a week later when my parents were to be in the area pet-sitting for a relative that they understood how damaging this had been, when we refused to meet them for dinner near our house. My mom had just assumed that not apologizing and pretending like nothing was wrong after a week would be good enough to let things <mark>blow</mark> over, which it was not.  
A few weeks later, I spent a few days with my father and tried to explain to him how damaging this had been to my girlfriend and our relationship. He succeeded in getting my mother to write a letter extending an ‘olive branch’ to her. She emailed this letter to me with the intention of me giving it to my girlfriend. The gist of it was ‘life is too short, we need to sit down and talk and work things out, I didn’t mean to hurt you.’  
My girlfriend was furious. She did not want to accept what she deemed an insufficient apology that was (to her) insincere. She was also angry that the letter was sent to me to give to her, and felt insulted that she couldn&#x27;t have had it sent to her directly. I was frustrated, because to me it had appeared that my mom was trying to make things right, especially since she knew that I was planning to propose in less than a month. I just wanted my girlfriend to accept her apology and move on with the understanding that things would be different with my mother moving forward, which she refused to do or believe. Instead, she penned a 7-page response outlining everything that my mother had ever done to her, calling her a liar, saying how she was trying to break us up, and ended it with “I don’t know that I could ever forgive you”. 

This, understandably, did not help the situation. My mother was not aware that I had been telling my girlfriend the bad things that she had been saying about her for the previous year and a half, so she quickly blamed me for everything, saying how it was ‘my fault that my girlfriend thought she hated her’ and how she was just ‘trying to point out all the red flags to me’. My parents threatened to not come to the proposal unless my girlfriend apologized for ‘beating up on them’ and sending the letter. She was incensed that they expected her to apologize for something that she did not start, and I just wanted everyone to play nice and try to move forward.

Unfortunately in all of this, my girlfriend found out about my plans to propose and did not want to start an engagement on bad terms with my family, so she reached out to them and asked for them to please still come. This obviously ruined the surprise for her that I had been working on for 6+ months. She told me that she was not forgiving them, but she knew how important it was for me that they be there. I should add that two of the diamonds in the engagement ring were a pair of earrings given to me by my mother that had been given to her by someone in our family incredibly important to me – this is important for later.  
At the proposal, I was still able to salvage some form of surprise and the actual event was great. Both families were all were able to sit down together and have a nice dinner (fiancé&#x27;s side of the family knowing none of the underlying drama.)  
I didn’t realize it at the time, but when my fiancé tried to hug my father, he sidestepped her and refused to speak to her. This absolutely destroyed her, as until all this drama he was the only real father figure she had left in her life, and she had no beef with him - only my mother.  
You will also probably see this coming, but my mother almost immediately texted me the following day saying how ungrateful my fiancé was since she did not thank her for providing the heirloom diamonds for the ring. She couldn’t even bite her tongue for 24 hours. She was also mad that she and my father were not in any of the pictures on the first Facebook post fiancé made, while her family was. (Never mind that my mother didn’t make a post on Facebook at all congratulating us – “well you know I just don’t post much on Facebook” was her excuse.)

  
A few weeks after the engagement, I convinced my fiancé to go to see my parents at a neutral site (they were pet-sitting for family) and try to hash everything out. I had the hopes that my parents would apologize, that my fiancé would accept the apology, and that maybe we could move forward.  
When we arrived, my parents made small talk and after about an hour or two, it became clear that they had no intention of starting a conversation. So I took it upon myself to start by saying “Dad, you obviously have an issue with fiancé since you refused to hug her at the engagement, so lets talk about it.” His response was “I have no issue with fiancé.”  
Once she heard this lie, she shut down and did not say another word.  
We had all had a couple glasses of wine, and my mother went into a long apology about how she should have supported fiancé more when her dad was sick, how she never meant to hurt her, etc. I was excited because I thought this would finally be a breakthrough apology. When she finished, we all turned to my fiancé to see what her response would be, and when she stayed silent I kind of made a joke about how she should talk too. Her response was “well, you know I don’t like talking about my feelings”. We left shortly thereafter and fiancé and I had a major fight in the car. I was angry that she would not even attempt to speak, and her justification was that why should she have to talk if my dad was going to lie and my mom wasn’t going to apologize for what she had done. (To be clear, my mother had apologized, but not for the things that fiancé wanted to have an apology for – saying horrible things about her).

  
Everything had been at a stalemate for a few weeks, until I recently went to spend a weekend with my mother 1-on-1. This was not well received by my fiancé, but I told her I needed time to try to work things out with my mom. She also needed a weekend to go wedding dress shopping with her family anyway. My mom and I had a lot of talks over the weekend and I tried to explain to her how I was tired of being the one put in the middle of all of this since the beginning, and how she should have just been honest from the beginning with my fiancé if she had issues, rather than always going through me. I explained how damaged our relationship has been by this and how she needed to fix it. She said how she has tried to apologize two different times (The initial letter and the face-to-face convo), but is tired of having her apologies slapped away. I convinced her to apologize one more time, and she wrote a short letter which she ended with “hurtful things have been said by both sides; I’m sorry what I said hurt you.”  
When I returned with this letter, fiancé was so angry with me for ‘always taking your mother’s side’ that she took her ring off during a fight. She said that I needed to figure out what to do to make things up and show her that she could actually wear it. Later, I said something to the effect of “Well, then I guess my relationship with my parents is done because there is no way I can have them in our life together”.

A few days later, she called my mom on her own accord and actually spoke to her about her feelings for the first time in all of this. My mom seemed to take this as meaning that everything is better between them. My fiancé is still furious, but says she did this for me because she knows that I can’t live with cutting them out of my life completely. The two of them talking is all that I wanted from the beginning, and after an hour it was apparently clear to my fiancé that my mother has no intention of apologizing again for what she wants her to apologize for. I&#x27;ve told her that I can&#x27;t force her to apologize as much as I would like to, just like I couldn&#x27;t force fiancé to call her.  
  
Which brings me to my request….I don’t know what to do to show my fiancé that I care more about her than my parents. She wants me to be mad at them for her, and the gist of our arguments always boil down to how she feels like I am not on her side. I have told her I don’t want to be in the middle anymore, and that I am on her side, but I don’t know how to show it to her. She says she ‘fixed’ things with my parents, so now I need to fix things with us. She’s mad that I didn’t agree with her when my mother sent the apology letters and say that they weren’t good enough. She’s mad that I was frustrated when she refused to have conversations with my family. It’s not that I agreed with my family, it’s just that I felt like the only way for her to be able to get over things with my mom was to face her head on and move past it, because otherwise it is just letting a wound fester. I feel like she wants me to go out and pick a fight with them so that I can defend her or show her she is more important to me. She says she just wants me on her side.  
I have suggested couples counseling, and she has not disagreed, but she says that she wants counseling to be something that makes a good relationship great, not one that saves a relationship. I just don&#x27;t know what else to do, and I&#x27;m tired of feeling like we are just talking in circles.

I appreciate any advice anyone might have, and I understand that I didn&#x27;t do a good job of setting boundaries from the beginning. I&#x27;m really trying to fix things here.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16kjb8g/my_friend_tony_24m_blows_up_at_me_26m_for_trying/" target="_blank" class="title">My friend Tony [24M] <mark>blow</mark>s up at me [26M] for trying to prevent a possible fight with a friend Richard [27M]. Should I stop being his friend after making me feel unsafe and uneasy in his home after his father [50+M] attacked Richard?</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Firstly, I would like to indicate the inclusion of alcohol and marijuana in this post. Personally I only took part in the alcohol. Onto the story:

Richard and I went to visit our friend Tony for an entire weekend. Seeing as he, Tony, Lives fairly far out of town and it was his birthday. During the celebration we each had a couple of drinks, played some 8 ball pool and even had a barbeque. during this time Tony and Richard had a few smokes of the green variety. Personally I do not like the stuff so they know not to try to get me involved.

However nearing the end of the night, we could not keep track of the pool table too well due to all of the other people in the house, so we decided to go to Tony&#x27;s room to end out the evening. being partially <mark>drunk</mark> myself I did not pay too much attention to what was happening at the time, but long story short, Tony was asking Richard to go get the remaining green cigarette. Tony was being very aggressive about it and Richard was not too happy about the tone of voice. In the end Richard decided not to do anything. This cause a major, what I could only describe as a temper tantrum from Tony. Slamming doors, kicking trash cans losing his glasses somewhere along the way and just basically getting more and more furious. Tony eventually grabbed Richard by the collar and rammed him into a wall while shouting. I was a bit stunned by all this up until this point, but ultimately decided I have to step in to prevent a fight. I <mark>forced</mark> them apart, only for Tony to turn his ire to me. Every time I tried to explain that I was de escalate the situation I was met with more shouting and hateful words. An example is Tony yelling at me as per quote: &quot;Who the F... do you think you are. Do you think you are just a big man for some reason? Just because you think you are better than me?&quot; Now for context I am one of the most fortunate among my friends, higher paying job and a car, but I do not treat any of my small amount of friends poorly or like I am better than them. I am basically that quiet friend that gets along with everyone, or so I thought. After that Tony goes running out the door and his father walks in. His father is just as confrontational so I once again try de escalating. Once again I am met with fairly hateful comments. Tony&#x27;s father ends up slapping Richard a bit and that is when I decide to leave for my own safety. Both Tony and his father are aggressive and my thought was what happens when Richard leaves? Is their ire going to be turned to me?

Tony&#x27;s mother tried convincing me to stay. She sees me as the only friend Tony has that is a proper person and a good influence. I denied her and left. This is not the first time that the father son duo has been overly aggressive. Be that with each other or with people that the one does not like. I am tired of having to be Tony&#x27;s placater after something like this happens. Usually I let people argue with each other and step in when it starts getting out of hand.

Before anyone says anything however, in our culture we normally let people argue it out first. Then everything is normally known between the two arguing parties and afterwards decisions can be made. In fact this was not the first falling out between Tony and Richard. That is their concern though. I just want to know if I would be wrong if I stop being Tony&#x27;s friend? I Have tried talking to him about his behavior multiple times already.</div>

How do I go back while keeping my marriage. I F/25 and husband M/30 married for a year.</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Hi everyone! 

I think I girlbossed too hard and now don&#x27;t know what to do. 5 years ago as a 21 year old I moved to NYC from Europe and I worked my butt off to make it (literally 3 jobs at a time- and not even nice jobs). Last year I got married and moved to PA suburbs, which was a decision that my boyfriend (husband now) made and I was &#x27;<mark>forced</mark>&#x27; to go along with. I wanna make it clear, it wasn&#x27;t him who <mark>forced</mark> me but it was either that or breaking up. At the time the most important thing to me was to be with him, I didn&#x27;t want to regret leaving someone who I knew I was going to marry.

Fast forward a year, I absolutely hate living in the suburbs. I don&#x27;t drive (and I&#x27;ve been too busy to learn), I have no friends here and I found a job that ended up traumatizing me with how toxic it was. I left multiple incredible friends in New York, people I consider and love like family, I left a job I loved and I left my favorite city I&#x27;ve ever lived in. I am so depressed, I have lost all ambition and desire to do anything in life. I am even questioning if I was right to think my husband was the one, he is a great person but we want completely different lifestyles. I never go out, I never see anyone besides my husband, I never do anything on my own. I left the toxic job to finish some graphic design courses I&#x27;ve been taking and completely change the industry I work in, but I don&#x27;t even want to do that. I have no motivation at all to do anything. 

I would be more than happy to live by myself in nyc and have a whatever job and all that, I just don&#x27;t really feel like hustling in a place where people go to bed at 7 pm. I feel like I&#x27;m one of those people who get heavily influenced by their environment. 

Moving to NYC as a couple is not an option, my husband refuses to. I can&#x27;t stand the suburbs, especially thinking about having kids and being a mom here for the rest of my life. 

What do I do? 

Summary: I need help figuring out how to make life better as a couple when we want different lifestyles. What&#x27;s the compromise?

EDIT: I will learn how to drive by the end of the year!I am aware it is a very important thing to be able to do anywhere in the states besides NYC. I am not dismissing everyone suggesting it, I am simply saying I don&#x27;t want to drive everywhere even if I was able to.

EDIT #2: I have read most of the comments I think and some of them were helpful and some were not. Thanks to all who tried to contribute with your insight, I didn&#x27;t expect this to <mark>blow</mark> up the way it did.
Just a few things I want to address. 
1- I may have misused the word girlbossed, what I meant by it was I took on a lot for a long time and established myself. After that I took on even more by moving somewhere I wasn&#x27;t totally comfortable with and completely changing my life. That is what I meant, if you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a lot, I don&#x27;t care. 
2- Nobody made me move here, with my free will I decided to. However, would I have moved on my own for any other reason in the world? No. That&#x27;s why I used the word <mark>forced</mark>. 
3- I am not using my husband for anything but for the reasons that anyone can get married, to have a partner in life. 
4- I only posted here to try and see if anyone on here has had a similar experience or knows someone with a similar experience so I could hear any possible solutions. I am not trying to victimize myself or villanize my husband. I love him a lot and I want to make things work. Regardless of the fact that I&#x27;ve had second thoughts, I&#x27;m not actually considering leaving him. Relationships are not just one decision that you deal with for the rest of your life, they&#x27;re an infinite amount of decisions that include chosing that one person over and over. This is just another decision. We work well as a couple, I&#x27;m personally just not in a good spot right now. 

I probably will never post again about personal problems, stangers on the internet say some of the wildest shit and I understand that it&#x27;s my own fault for spilling my guts.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">I left my childhood sweetheart a year and a half ago because of declining confidence in her finances. 

I was excited to start life with her after I graduated university but I always told her I didn’t want to get married until she completed her undergraduate education (I’ve seen too many women in my family sacrifice their dreams for their partners which ends in resentment).

She had not been in school while I was 32 hours working and full time in college. I didn’t pressure her but I always pushed her to follow her dreams and I’d support her emotionally and financially where I could.

She ended up wanting to become an ultrasound technician, and I tell her she should enroll in community college (she always struggled with school growing up so I knew if she felt like she had to drop the program it would only cost her a couple hundred bucks instead of thousands). 

She became infatuated with the idea of becoming an ultrasound technician as soon as possible and I think her love of Instagram and watching other people graduate college influenced her tremendously. She ended up enrolling into a private institution that cost $70,000 for a one year technician program. I knew this would end in a disaster but I voiced my opinion once and she yelled at me for doubting her and I just let her do her own thing afterwards.

Long story short she ends up failing English twice and pharmacology and is <mark>forced</mark> to drop out of the program in 5 months. Once she dropped out of the program I began to seriously reevaluate our future together because now she owed around $30,000 without a single credit to her name. This was on top of her getting an apartment she couldn’t afford with her roommate, and a dog (all things I warned against).

I feel shallow for doing this but I eventually ended up leaving her after a couple weeks because I just couldn’t see us getting out of her poor decision making. There were some other issues in the relationship before that but generally we were really happy together. I’ve been on several dates and in one relationship and one Situationship sense but I’ve never enjoyed anyone’s company as much as her.

Did I make the right move?

Edit: I might not have explained it correctly.

I did push her to figure out what she wanted to do, but I did not tell her she had to go to college. She’s a grown woman.

After her taking 2 years off after high-school, she told me she wanted to be a nurse, then eventually she switched to ultrasound.

I recommended she start with community college because it’s cheaper and there’s more margin for error (that was the same logic I used picking my university).

I realized she wasn’t doing well when she kept <mark>blow</mark>ing off her assignments to watch Netflix. She also began lying to me about completing her assignments and her grades. I was very involved until she started lying.

I also have no plans on reaching out to her. I’m just reflecting.

Edit 2: I found out that she ended up enrolling into a community college recently. Outside of that I haven’t spoken to her. Why are you guys taking things so personal?</div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1670gqe/my_22m_girlfriend_25f_is_still_in_contact_with/" target="_blank" class="title">My (22M) Girlfriend (25F) is still in contact with her Ex (25M)</a>
            <div class="content collapsed">Hi. This is going to be a really long post; please bear with me as I have nowhere to rant about this. As the title suggests, my girlfriend (let&#x27;s call her Lia) is still in contact with her ex (let&#x27;s call him Tim).  
  
For background, I&#x27;ve known my current girlfriend for over a year. We started working at the same firm, and she and I quickly became best friends. She told me that she was in a long-term relationship of 5 years at that point, which started in her 1st year of university. During that time, we were a trio of friends – me, Lia, and Jim (22M). Jim was another co-worker of ours and had worked with Lia for a month longer than me on a special project. They were very close and hung out every day, and people suspected that they dated.  
  
Six months before I met Lia, Tim relocated to another part of the city for his job but had issues with Lia having male best friends and how she dressed. Lia is outgoing and fun and makes a lot of male friends easily. That was a common issue between Tim and Lia, and ever since Lia graduated, she always thought of breaking up with Tim but couldn&#x27;t do it; I don&#x27;t know why. Even when I met Lia, we quickly became best friends, and the three of us (me, Lia, and Jim) used to hang out every day. During that time, I noticed that Jim and Lia looked at each other differently, like prolonged eye contact, and Lia used to sleep on Jim&#x27;s shoulder, etc., while she was in a broken relationship with Tim. In February of this year, Jim and Lia started dating. I found out about this a month later when Jim sent me snaps of them together, and I asked Lia what was going on. After finding out that Lia had been lying to me and going on dates with Jim, I had a fight with Lia. I told her she should&#x27;ve told me sooner, and during that time, I realized I had some sort of feelings towards Lia.  
  
Lia had suffered from depression and had taken meds from her university times, and Tim was the first guy she was in a relationship with. In February, Lia told me about Tim and showed me his messages, and they were pretty bad. Tim was degrading Lia and her family and was using slangs against her. I felt enraged during that time, and I gave Lia a lecture about how bad it was for her self-respect and how she should cut him off. She told me that in her mind, things had been ended with Tim since they graduated, but she couldn&#x27;t cut him off because it would show weakness, and she couldn&#x27;t do that to him. She wanted him to move on from her on his own. I told her that was hypocrisy and she should cut him off so he can move on. But things became quiet, and I got involved in the relationship between Lia and Jim. At this point, I knew everything about Lia&#x27;s current life, and we were pretty close, which bothered Jim. He brought this up to Lia, and Lia told him we were best friends.  
  
During a dinner party, we invited Lia&#x27;s friend from Uni, and she told her no. Jim gave me the phone and asked me to talk to her. As I did, she readily agreed to come after which Jim started saying that she liked me. (We met at Lia&#x27;s birthday, and she did ask Lia about me, and Lia said I&#x27;m a nice guy.) Lia got visibly upset at that, hugged me, which further infuriated Jim, and he left and didn&#x27;t come to the dinner. (At this point, I didn&#x27;t know about Jim and Lia dating.) After that, I found out that Jim was extremely toxic and controlling. (He read mine and Lia&#x27;s messages on her phone, checked her phone; he had her snap location open for him and WhatsApp last seen open only for him. He had access to all her Gmail IDs, and even if Lia asked to log out, he changed the topic. This was only during the 1st month of the relationship.)  
  
Their fights escalated, and Lia broke up with him. They were never an official couple, but everyone in our office knew about them or had speculated about it. Jim&#x27;s reaction to the breakup was extreme, and he almost had a meltdown and was in a really bad state. I used to hang out with him every day and even invited him to my friends&#x27; dinner, just to make sure he was not alone. On the last day when I was dropping him home, he talked to me as if he was trying to say he knew Lia more than me and was making me know my limits. He even told me graphic details of how their first kiss went and how many times they did it and told me that he thinks Lia used him as a rebound or for sexual purposes. I was extremely mad and pissed off at this and went straight to Lia&#x27;s house and asked her to sort this out. She was sad, and I told her that if she didn&#x27;t end this thing with Jim right now, she would lose 2 people from her life (me and Jim), instead of just Jim.  
  
After that night, I stopped talking to Jim because, in my opinion, what they both did was consensual, and no one took advantage of another person. It was a really crappy thing to do and tell me. After a week of no contact with Jim, Lia and Jim had a long conversation about their relationship, and Jim used guilt-tripping to make Lia give him another chance and said he would do better. That night, Lia messaged me with &quot;Did I do the right thing,&quot; and I told her it was her decision and she made the right choice according to her, and that I would be leaving the trio. After that, Lia hung out with Jim (albeit hesitantly) and even went out with him for shopping with her family, but she told me that she still wasn&#x27;t ready for it, and Jim was still toxic, and she would end things with him once he goes back to his family for vacation.  
  
Remember, at this point, I had feelings for her, but I never influenced her decision because I wanted her to do what was best for her. Lia broke up with Jim over the phone when he was visiting his family in April. (So they dated from mid-Feb to mid-April.) In April, Tim also came, and Lia and Tim almost ended things.  
  
From February to April, Lia&#x27;s mental health took a nosedive, and she was in a really bad state. Jim really scarred her, and she started caring more about her phone, making sure no one was using it, becoming more defensive and less outgoing. She stopped making new friends and became very quiet when in a new company.  
  
Lia and I started to get closer to one another, and in May, I caught Lia messaging Tim as if they were still together. I asked her what she wanted, and she said Tim was familiar to her. I reminded her of what happened between me and her, and she started crying and told me she didn&#x27;t know what to do. She told me that according to her, I am her ideal person to marry, and I told her I have feelings for her too. We decided that we would stay friends and see how things go from here, as Lia didn&#x27;t want a relationship. My real motive behind telling Lia during that moment was to know that Tim wasn&#x27;t her last option.  
  
We started hanging out more and more, but one day during May, I asked her if she was physically attracted to me. She told me she only loved me platonically, not romantically, and I asked her to quantify it. She told me that if she was attracted to Tim 100%, relative to that, Jim was 60%, and I was 20%. If I&#x27;m being honest, that really hurt me. I didn&#x27;t know what to say, but I loved her a lot and told her I&#x27;d give her time. From that time onwards, she told me 3 times that she just wanted to be friends with me, and all 3 times, I said okay, but she herself returned back to being more than friends with me. I told her that by being just my friend, I would treat her like one and wouldn&#x27;t give her the attention and care she had at that point from me, and she always came back. I&#x27;m guessing she never wanted to lose that attention.  
  
During that time, Jim came back, and they hung out again. Every time Lia and Jim hung out, I was reminded of the time Jim told me about the details of their encounter, and I asked Lia to stop hanging out with Jim, to which she had always replied that she didn&#x27;t have any feelings for Jim, and Jim knows it too. My case was that even if she didn&#x27;t have feelings for Jim, Jim did for her, and it wasn&#x27;t right. In June, Jim was heading back to his family for a week, and he had his flight. I asked Lia to meet with me and was on a call with her at around 3 am on the same day. I told her I would prefer if she wouldn&#x27;t meet with him, but she told me, and I remember this as clearly as day, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make a decision by being influenced by you,&quot; and it broke me. She told me she would decide, and her mood got bad. At the end of the call, she said okay, she wouldn&#x27;t meet him and would message him, but it wouldn&#x27;t be good of her to ignore him as his friend. The next morning, I messaged her to meet with him, even if I didn&#x27;t want it. She said she would just have lunch with him, and it would be done, and I could come meet her at around 5 pm.  
  
She hung out with him from 12 pm until his flight at 8 pm, and she even dropped him at the airport. I was in such a bad mood that my best friends came to pick me up and took me to a place to chill. They didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but it helped me. I calmed down and came back to meet Lia that night at around 12 am. We talked about it, and I told her I was considering leaving her after this. (Till this point, Lia told me she wasn&#x27;t completely in love with me and loved me platonically. Things started to go better and I found out Lia was still messaging Tim and calling him &quot;Hon&quot;.  
I was sitting with her one day and I asked how Tim is doing. I knew they were in contact and it had been almost a month since we last talked about Tim. She told me that he is coming back to our city , and i asked her if she is planning on telling him about things and ending things up with him. One thing lead to another and I asked her to show me her messages with him. She did (although she wasnt on board) , and I went through her convo with Tim and they were calling each other &quot;Hon&quot; like they always did) and she was sending him her selfies (Non sexual) but imo sending your pics in dm to anyone when they were asking for it is a big no no for me. We had a fight but i let it go that moment.  
Come my birthday in June (late June) , and 2 days before that , I was on a call with her and she just had came home from somewhere. I asked her where she went and she was weirdly dismissive about it. She told me it was none of her business and i poked more into it ( i was thinking she went to buy me a gift , so i was having fun) and suddenly she started being mad at me for acting like a detective and i told her we should end the call. I felt bad for it and apologized to her. My birthday went and we went onto our normal life , during early July (Tim was still in our City). I found Tim&#x27;s messages on her phone , I looked at her phone infront of her , and asked for her permission.  
For a bit of context, it might seemed like we never had anything between us from the convos but it was not the case. Lia used to ask me atleast 10-15 times a day to marry her , and used to meet me every single day. We hung out everyday but acted more like bestfriends than BF and GF. She also hesitated in calling me her BF and preferred calling me her Bestestfriend infront of people (she did the same thing with Tim and Jim too so thats not smthing big). We also kissed for the first time on the night of my birthday and it was amazing. She said it was best kiss she had and since then , she told me she was in romantic love with me.  
So once I found those messages ( Lia asked me to marry her that morning too multiple times) , I found out she shared her pics to him again , and she met him 2 days before our birthday, and was planning to meet him the next day too , with messages with &quot;I miss u hon&quot; &amp; through the messages, I found out she hugged Tim too (Tim is a religous guy so he doesnt kiss &amp; do PDA) That broke something inside of it. Before this , everytime something happened between me and Lia , I always asked her to stay with me and we will work this out but this ruined me. I calmly told Lia to do whatever she wants to , and I hope the best for her and went home.  
Note, till this day, I have never once have shouted on Lia , for anything, not even raised my voice infront of her. Even on that day, I was calm and told her its okay if she wants him and i wish her to be happy with him. As I reached home, my phone started to <mark>blow</mark> up with messages from her and it was literally hundreds of messages. Ranging from &quot;Didnt you know I love you&quot; to &quot; I will block him infront of you&quot; etc etc.  
I am a firm believer of the fact that you should give your partner alot of space. As much as they want and should never force anything onto them, thats why unlike Jim , I always gave her space , never <mark>forced</mark> her to Block Tim , and wanted her to do it on her own accord. Tim used to get mad when she anwered his texts a bit late but i never got angry even if she did after hours. She cried and begged me to come back and after a week we had a talk and I did. Things got better and she started behaving more a girlfriend to me (But we still talked like bestfriends on messages).  
I dropped the entire topic about Tim alltogether and never asked her if she had blocked him or not for the next 3 weeks or so) Things started to get better, and she started behaving more like a girlfriend to me. (But we still talked as best friends through messages.) I dropped the entire topic about Tim altogether and never asked her if she had blocked him or not for the next 3 weeks or so. After that, I asked her if she had talked to Tim about it, and she said she didn&#x27;t because Tim was in a really bad place mentally.  
  
In August, I talked with her elder sister about her and told her everything (I am on great terms with her family, and all of her family members like me. I hang out with them often, and they are all good people). Her sister talked with her about it, and her elder sister. Note that she wanted me to marry her all this time, and her family too. She talked to me about it multiple times since July (although less frequently compared to June), but she did. I told her sister that if she hadn&#x27;t decided to block him, it means she still loves him, and I can&#x27;t marry a person who loves someone else. They talked to her, and since then, things have changed drastically. She said she finally decided to show me she loves me and is more affectionate to me, acting like a girlfriend to me.  
  
I think it&#x27;s because they know I am a good catch for marriage and they told her not to let go of me. I think this because her sister asked me that her family wants her to get married within the next 6 months. I can be wrong, and her sister telling her how I think about Tim made her think she should let me know how much she loves me, but I don&#x27;t know. But aside from that, something has really changed in me. I was the person who wasn&#x27;t willing to let go of this relationship with her till June, but after the events of July, my first instinct is to leave everything and end this. Every single time. She also told me this, and I told her it wasn&#x27;t good for me. I don&#x27;t want to be a toxic person and be wary of my girlfriend, snooping around or checking her phone. I want to trust her, but I can&#x27;t get it out of my mind. Also, the only thing I remember about my birthday is that she met her ex 2 days before it and even gaslighted me into saying sorry.  
  
It&#x27;s almost September, 2 months since July, and I know for a fact she still hasn&#x27;t blocked her ex. She talks to him way less now (like once every week or so), but I don&#x27;t know how often they talk on messages. I asked her if she is still calling him &quot;Hon,&quot; and she declined it, and I want to believe her word, but whenever I&#x27;m alone, I think about this. Tim is not better than me in any way, and Lia is the love of my life, but I don&#x27;t know. I gave an ultimatum to myself till September 30th, that if Lia hasn&#x27;t blocked Tim by that point, I will leave her, but I want to see for myself what their chats are like. It is also combined with the thought that Lia went for Jim first too and was attracted to him first but was only liked me platonically. Also, that hurts a lot, and I talked about it with her. I think about all of these things, and they are not pleasant at all. I don&#x27;t know what to do. Whenever she doesn&#x27;t reply to my messages, My mind always go to what if She hanging out with Jim or talking to Tim.  
  
I am thinking about asking her to show me the messages between Her and Tim , is this really a good thing to do?  
  
Note: Lia does love me and talks to me almost every hour. We hang out every single day after work, and she messages me and updates me about her day. Tim, on the other hand, messages her himself. But the thought that what if she doesnt love me and is faking this to just marry me because im a good choice is crushing me.  
  
TL;DR : My (22M) GF(25F) is still in contact with her Ex (25M) even after me telling her to end it multiple times and now I&#x27;m thinking of asking her to show me the chats between her and Ex and ending things if things are the same as before.

            <div class="content collapsed">Hi. This is going to be a really long post; please bear with me as I have nowhere to rant about this. As the title suggests, my girlfriend (let&#x27;s call her Lia) is still in contact with her ex (let&#x27;s call him Tim).  
  
For background, I&#x27;ve known my current girlfriend for over a year. We started working at the same firm, and she and I quickly became best friends. She told me that she was in a long-term relationship of 5 years at that point, which started in her 1st year of university. During that time, we were a trio of friends – me, Lia, and Jim (22M). Jim was another co-worker of ours and had worked with Lia for a month longer than me on a special project. They were very close and hung out every day, and people suspected that they dated.  
  
Six months before I met Lia, Tim relocated to another part of the city for his job but had issues with Lia having male best friends and how she dressed. Lia is outgoing and fun and makes a lot of male friends easily. That was a common issue between Tim and Lia, and ever since Lia graduated, she always thought of breaking up with Tim but couldn&#x27;t do it; I don&#x27;t know why. Even when I met Lia, we quickly became best friends, and the three of us (me, Lia, and Jim) used to hang out every day. During that time, I noticed that Jim and Lia looked at each other differently, like prolonged eye contact, and Lia used to sleep on Jim&#x27;s shoulder, etc., while she was in a broken relationship with Tim. In February of this year, Jim and Lia started dating. I found out about this a month later when Jim sent me snaps of them together, and I asked Lia what was going on. After finding out that Lia had been lying to me and going on dates with Jim, I had a fight with Lia. I told her she should&#x27;ve told me sooner, and during that time, I realized I had some sort of feelings towards Lia.  
  
Lia had suffered from depression and had taken meds from her university times, and Tim was the first guy she was in a relationship with. In February, Lia told me about Tim and showed me his messages, and they were pretty bad. Tim was degrading Lia and her family and was using slangs against her. I felt enraged during that time, and I gave Lia a lecture about how bad it was for her self-respect and how she should cut him off. She told me that in her mind, things had been ended with Tim since they graduated, but she couldn&#x27;t cut him off because it would show weakness, and she couldn&#x27;t do that to him. She wanted him to move on from her on his own. I told her that was hypocrisy and she should cut him off so he can move on. But things became quiet, and I got involved in the relationship between Lia and Jim. At this point, I knew everything about Lia&#x27;s current life, and we were pretty close, which bothered Jim. He brought this up to Lia, and Lia told him we were best friends.  
  
During a dinner party, we invited Lia&#x27;s friend from Uni, and she told her no. Jim gave me the phone and asked me to talk to her. As I did, she readily agreed to come after which Jim started saying that she liked me. (We met at Lia&#x27;s birthday, and she did ask Lia about me, and Lia said I&#x27;m a nice guy.) Lia got visibly upset at that, hugged me, which further infuriated Jim, and he left and didn&#x27;t come to the dinner. (At this point, I didn&#x27;t know about Jim and Lia dating.) After that, I found out that Jim was extremely toxic and controlling. (He read mine and Lia&#x27;s messages on her phone, checked her phone; he had her snap location open for him and WhatsApp last seen open only for him. He had access to all her Gmail IDs, and even if Lia asked to log out, he changed the topic. This was only during the 1st month of the relationship.)  
  
Their fights escalated, and Lia broke up with him. They were never an official couple, but everyone in our office knew about them or had speculated about it. Jim&#x27;s reaction to the breakup was extreme, and he almost had a meltdown and was in a really bad state. I used to hang out with him every day and even invited him to my friends&#x27; dinner, just to make sure he was not alone. On the last day when I was dropping him home, he talked to me as if he was trying to say he knew Lia more than me and was making me know my limits. He even told me graphic details of how their first kiss went and how many times they did it and told me that he thinks Lia used him as a rebound or for sexual purposes. I was extremely mad and pissed off at this and went straight to Lia&#x27;s house and asked her to sort this out. She was sad, and I told her that if she didn&#x27;t end this thing with Jim right now, she would lose 2 people from her life (me and Jim), instead of just Jim.  
  
After that night, I stopped talking to Jim because, in my opinion, what they both did was consensual, and no one took advantage of another person. It was a really crappy thing to do and tell me. After a week of no contact with Jim, Lia and Jim had a long conversation about their relationship, and Jim used guilt-tripping to make Lia give him another chance and said he would do better. That night, Lia messaged me with &quot;Did I do the right thing,&quot; and I told her it was her decision and she made the right choice according to her, and that I would be leaving the trio. After that, Lia hung out with Jim (albeit hesitantly) and even went out with him for shopping with her family, but she told me that she still wasn&#x27;t ready for it, and Jim was still toxic, and she would end things with him once he goes back to his family for vacation.  
  
Remember, at this point, I had feelings for her, but I never influenced her decision because I wanted her to do what was best for her. Lia broke up with Jim over the phone when he was visiting his family in April. (So they dated from mid-Feb to mid-April.) In April, Tim also came, and Lia and Tim almost ended things.  
  
From February to April, Lia&#x27;s mental health took a nosedive, and she was in a really bad state. Jim really scarred her, and she started caring more about her phone, making sure no one was using it, becoming more defensive and less outgoing. She stopped making new friends and became very quiet when in a new company.  
  
Lia and I started to get closer to one another, and in May, I caught Lia messaging Tim as if they were still together. I asked her what she wanted, and she said Tim was familiar to her. I reminded her of what happened between me and her, and she started crying and told me she didn&#x27;t know what to do. She told me that according to her, I am her ideal person to marry, and I told her I have feelings for her too. We decided that we would stay friends and see how things go from here, as Lia didn&#x27;t want a relationship. My real motive behind telling Lia during that moment was to know that Tim wasn&#x27;t her last option.  
  
We started hanging out more and more, but one day during May, I asked her if she was physically attracted to me. She told me she only loved me platonically, not romantically, and I asked her to quantify it. She told me that if she was attracted to Tim 100%, relative to that, Jim was 60%, and I was 20%. If I&#x27;m being honest, that really hurt me. I didn&#x27;t know what to say, but I loved her a lot and told her I&#x27;d give her time. From that time onwards, she told me 3 times that she just wanted to be friends with me, and all 3 times, I said okay, but she herself returned back to being more than friends with me. I told her that by being just my friend, I would treat her like one and wouldn&#x27;t give her the attention and care she had at that point from me, and she always came back. I&#x27;m guessing she never wanted to lose that attention.  
  
During that time, Jim came back, and they hung out again. Every time Lia and Jim hung out, I was reminded of the time Jim told me about the details of their encounter, and I asked Lia to stop hanging out with Jim, to which she had always replied that she didn&#x27;t have any feelings for Jim, and Jim knows it too. My case was that even if she didn&#x27;t have feelings for Jim, Jim did for her, and it wasn&#x27;t right. In June, Jim was heading back to his family for a week, and he had his flight. I asked Lia to meet with me and was on a call with her at around 3 am on the same day. I told her I would prefer if she wouldn&#x27;t meet with him, but she told me, and I remember this as clearly as day, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make a decision by being influenced by you,&quot; and it broke me. She told me she would decide, and her mood got bad. At the end of the call, she said okay, she wouldn&#x27;t meet him and would message him, but it wouldn&#x27;t be good of her to ignore him as his friend. The next morning, I messaged her to meet with him, even if I didn&#x27;t want it. She said she would just have lunch with him, and it would be done, and I could come meet her at around 5 pm.  
  
She hung out with him from 12 pm until his flight at 8 pm, and she even dropped him at the airport. I was in such a bad mood that my best friends came to pick me up and took me to a place to chill. They didn&#x27;t know what the problem was, but it helped me. I calmed down and came back to meet Lia that night at around 12 am. We talked about it, and I told her I was considering leaving her after this. (Till this point, Lia told me she wasn&#x27;t completely in love with me and loved me platonically. Things started to go better and I found out Lia was still messaging Tim and calling him &quot;Hon&quot;.  
I was sitting with her one day and I asked how Tim is doing. I knew they were in contact and it had been almost a month since we last talked about Tim. She told me that he is coming back to our city , and i asked her if she is planning on telling him about things and ending things up with him. One thing lead to another and I asked her to show me her messages with him. She did (although she wasnt on board) , and I went through her convo with Tim and they were calling each other &quot;Hon&quot; like they always did) and she was sending him her selfies (Non sexual) but imo sending your pics in dm to anyone when they were asking for it is a big no no for me. We had a fight but i let it go that moment.  
Come my birthday in June (late June) , and 2 days before that , I was on a call with her and she just had came home from somewhere. I asked her where she went and she was weirdly dismissive about it. She told me it was none of her business and i poked more into it ( i was thinking she went to buy me a gift , so i was having fun) and suddenly she started being mad at me for acting like a detective and i told her we should end the call. I felt bad for it and apologized to her. My birthday went and we went onto our normal life , during early July (Tim was still in our City). I found Tim&#x27;s messages on her phone , I looked at her phone infront of her , and asked for her permission.   
For a bit of context, it might seemed like we never had anything between us from the convos but it was not the case. Lia used to ask me atleast 10-15 times a day to marry her , and used to meet me every single day. We hung out everyday but acted more like bestfriends than BF  and GF. She also hesitated in calling me her BF and preferred calling me her Bestestfriend infront of people (she did the same thing with Tim and Jim too so thats not smthing big). We also kissed for the first time on the night of my birthday and it was amazing. She said it was best kiss she had and since then , she told me she was in romantic love with me.   
So once I found those messages ( Lia asked me to marry her that morning too multiple times) ,  I found out she shared her pics to him again , and she met him 2 days before our birthday, and was planning to meet him the next day too , with messages with &quot;I miss u hon&quot; &amp; through the messages, I found out she hugged Tim too (Tim is a religous guy so he doesnt kiss &amp; do PDA) That broke something inside of it. Before this , everytime something happened between me and Lia , I always asked her to stay with me and we will work this out but this ruined me. I calmly told Lia to do whatever she wants to , and I hope the best for her and went home.  
Note, till this day, I have never once have shouted on Lia , for anything, not even raised my voice infront of her. Even on that day, I was calm and told her its okay if she wants him and i wish her to be happy with him. As I reached home, my phone started to <mark>blow</mark> up with messages from her and it was literally hundreds of messages. Ranging from &quot;Didnt you know I love you&quot; to &quot; I will block him infront of you&quot; etc etc.  
I am a firm believer of the fact that you should give your partner alot of space. As much as they want and should never force anything onto them, thats why unlike Jim , I always gave her space , never <mark>forced</mark> her to Block Tim , and wanted her to do it on her own accord. Tim used to get mad when she anwered his texts a bit late but i never got angry even if she did after hours. She cried and begged me to come back and after a week we had a talk and I did. Things got better and she started behaving more a girlfriend to me (But we still talked like bestfriends on messages).   
I dropped the entire topic about Tim alltogether and never asked her if she had blocked him or not for the next 3 weeks or so) Things started to get better, and she started behaving more like a girlfriend to me. (But we still talked as best friends through messages.) I dropped the entire topic about Tim altogether and never asked her if she had blocked him or not for the next 3 weeks or so. After that, I asked her if she had talked to Tim about it, and she said she didn&#x27;t because Tim was in a really bad place mentally.  
  
In August, I talked with her elder sister about her and told her everything (I am on great terms with her family, and all of her family members like me. I hang out with them often, and they are all good people). Her sister talked with her about it, and her elder sister. Note that she wanted me to marry her all this time, and her family too. She talked to me about it multiple times since July (although less frequently compared to June), but she did. I told her sister that if she hadn&#x27;t decided to block him, it means she still loves him, and I can&#x27;t marry a person who loves someone else. They talked to her, and since then, things have changed drastically. She said she finally decided to show me she loves me and is more affectionate to me, acting like a girlfriend to me.  
  
I think it&#x27;s because they know I am a good catch for marriage and they told her not to let go of me. I think this because her sister asked me that her family wants her to get married within the next 6 months. I can be wrong, and her sister telling her how I think about Tim made her think she should let me know how much she loves me, but I don&#x27;t know. But aside from that, something has really changed in me. I was the person who wasn&#x27;t willing to let go of this relationship with her till June, but after the events of July, my first instinct is to leave everything and end this. Every single time. She also told me this, and I told her it wasn&#x27;t good for me. I don&#x27;t want to be a toxic person and be wary of my girlfriend, snooping around or checking her phone. I want to trust her, but I can&#x27;t get it out of my mind. Also, the only thing I remember about my birthday is that she met her ex 2 days before it and even gaslighted me into saying sorry.  
  
It&#x27;s almost September, 2 months since July, and I know for a fact she still hasn&#x27;t blocked her ex. She talks to him way less now (like once every week or so), but I don&#x27;t know how often they talk on messages. I asked her if she is still calling him &quot;Hon,&quot; and she declined it, and I want to believe her word, but whenever I&#x27;m alone, I think about this. Tim is not better than me in any way, and Lia is the love of my life, but I don&#x27;t know. I gave an ultimatum to myself till September 30th, that if Lia hasn&#x27;t blocked Tim by that point, I will leave her, but I want to see for myself what their chats are like. It is also combined with the thought that Lia went for Jim first too and was attracted to him first but was only liked me platonically. Also, that hurts a lot, and I talked about it with her. I think about all of these things, and they are not pleasant at all. I don&#x27;t know what to do. Whenever she doesn&#x27;t reply to my messages, My mind always go to what if She hanging out with Jim or talking to Tim.  


I am thinking about asking her to show me the messages between Her and Tim , is this really a good thing to do?   
  
Note: Lia does love me and talks to me almost every hour. We hang out every single day after work, and she messages me and updates me about her day. Tim, on the other hand, messages her himself. But the thought that what if she doesnt love me and is faking this to just marry me because im a good choice is crushing me.

TL;DR : My (22M) GF(25F) is still in contact with her Ex (25M) even after me telling her to end it multiple times and now I&#x27;m thinking of asking her to show me the chats between her and Ex and ending things if things are the same as before.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">Long read but I&#x27;d really appreciate some opinions.   


Throwaway account.   
So, I 25M have been with my fiancé 27F for almost 4 years now and engaged for almost a year and are on the verge of breaking everything off.   
Backstory - I&#x27;m jewish and have always been relatively religious. I was born into and raised this way but. important to note, I was never <mark>forced</mark> to do anything. If I didnt want to keep shabbat when I was a little kid, no one <mark>forced</mark> me to. If I wanted to do something for myself, again, as a little kid as long as I was safe and responsible my parents allowed me to do so. The idea I&#x27;m getting at is I was raised knowing whats what religiously, my parents are observant but much like myself, are &quot;normal&quot; and basically taught me the religion and what it means but again, never <mark>forced</mark> me into anything. Whatever I do I do for myself and my relationship with GD and thats that. I keep strict kosher and shabbat, all the holidays, etc. That said, I am by no means &quot;ultra-orthodox&quot; or even close to it. I have piercings, enjoy to drink or smoke socially, have a good normal job, love making money, going out, having a good time etc etc. Just a normal ass dude with hobbies, and all that &quot;normal&quot; stuff but observe these aspects of the religion. On the flip side, my fiancé who is also jewish was not raised this way, or with any emphasis on religion at all for that matter. Other than major holidays and whatnot, nothing else was ever really practiced.    


Now as mentioned, my fiancé and I have been together for nearly 4 years. I see a future, a family, and simply, a life with this woman. Throughout (most) of our relationship, she&#x27;s supported my ways meaning our house is fully kosher, whenever we get invited to an event that has unkosher food she will not eat out of respect for me and us, we dont go out on Friday nights or Saturdays during the day but have shabbat dinner every week etc etc. Just simply, supports the way I practice the religion. Not much anymore but but what feels like forever ago, she would often even encourage me to do little things here and there that apply to the religion. It was amazing and honestly, took me so far over the edge in the best way because I had never been with someone that not only supported me in this way but also encouraged it. What made it more meaningful was that I know she had no connection to any of this but really just did it for me and us. At this point its worth mentioning, other than what im about to get into, we have a beautiful relationship. Like literally perfect. We like the same stuff, our values (outside of religion) are the same, the bedroom gets spicy, we enjoy each others company, are very open in our communication, etc etc. Like literally all in all, really do have a great relationship with each other.  


Here&#x27;s where s\*\*t hits the fan --   
A little less than a year ago, she really started pulling away from the religion. Like not disbelief in GD or anything like that, just finds the practice of the religion (shabbat, kosher, etc.) very limiting and restrictive which to be fair, yes, it absolutely is. As someone that never did any of these things to then start taking it all, I fully understand how much youre essentially getting rid of. I really do and I know its a lot. But hey, we were good, happy, had the conversations about religion, starting a family, getting married, etc. and always managed to stay with each other for each other. Not out of comfort or convenience, but really just being very much in love with each other and what we have together. In hindsight, while it was never an enthusiastic, &quot;yes im all for this!!!!&quot; from her, it was a yes because we want a life and future with each other. So, before we got engaged and me not trying to <mark>blow</mark> the surprise of getting engaged, I brought this conversation up somehow (I really dont remember) and really genuinely made sure to talk about EVERYTHING in detail, as we had in the past, but really really emphasize the importance of the conversation and the future of our lives together. We talked about what our lives, careers, family, raising kids, all of it would look like in relation to the religion. The full A-Z. The consensus was that while its not the most 110% ideal, we were willing to resume living our lives this way, raise kids this way, etc etc. but always keep in mind that much like myself, should our kids ever want to &quot;do their own thing&quot; non religiously, they should be able to. I was all for that as that was exactly how I was raised. Taught whats what, but never <mark>forced</mark>. 6 months later I popped the question and she said yes!   


At the time, we really couldn&#x27;t plan a wedding or anything because she was busy with school and I know how much of her time she was investing into this, I was cool with waiting till everything wraps up and then we can really commit time to planning a wedding. So, she finishes, everything is good and then s\*\*t hits the fan even harder. Her parents begin to get heavily involved in us and our marriage and religion and just all of it. So when she finished everything and I began asking to plan a wedding we never really got beyond a google search. And slowly but surely, her parents constantly made sure to remind her how this religion is not good for her, how they think shes not happy, how shes meant to go out and do this and do that and just really getting in her head about it. Theyre literally against the religion. Well, I guess just telling her wasnt enough because at some point a few months after finishing everything, we kinda got more into planning a wedding. Going to look at venues and whatnot and then one day, out of the blue, I get a text from her dad saying something along the lines of we (dad and mom) understand that this is the life you guys want and if thats the case, totally cool but we will not be attending your wedding becuase it will basically break up our family. Paraphrasing but that was the overall message.   
They think that because of the religion, they wont be able to see their grandkids, take them places where and when they want, that they&#x27;ll lose their daughter etc etc.   
Well, &quot;were not showing up to your wedding&quot; eventually turned into &quot;we dont want anything to do with your kids because we wont have any relationship with them.&quot; Because shabbat and kosher destroy a relationship with your grandkids right? Well thats how they feel. To make matters slightly worse, shes an only child with no close family. Her parents are really it and so hearing things like that has a huge affect on her and rightfully so. Whats crazier is her parents love me. Literally treated me like a son in so many ways, and her dad openly told me, I love you, I would do just about anything for you if you ever needed or asked for it (and I know he would because he has), everything is perfect except this one thing. The one thing being my religious practice. Its just madness to me. They know what theyre doing too. This is literally to force either my hand or her hand one way or another. Pick your family, pick your fiancé, or have your fiancé (me) break his religious values. If he does, we&#x27;re good. If you pick us, we&#x27;re good. If you pick him, say bye to us. No in-between. I tried talking to her dad about it but it was a useless conversation. Nothing I said would change what they think.   


As you can imagine, this has put an immense amount of stress and problems on our relationship and have really made her feelings about all of this even worse. She doesnt think what theyre doing is right, but also, is not nearly as outraged by it as I am because on some level, she feels the same way. We have not planned a single thing and been engaged for almost a year, and as of these last few days, its basically gotten to the point where if I now dont break these core values that she met me with, supported me with, agreed to before ever even considering marriage, etc etc. we&#x27;re done. Literally core values I&#x27;ve upheld my entire life, like keeping kosher and shabbat, and if I dont break them we are basically over. The argument is that, well, I did all this for you for all this time, you should be able to do the same. Her parents say the same thing..   


Even though I know on some level she held these beliefs against all of it herself, it was never this extreme and we always managed to make things work and again, have a solid happy and healthy relationship. And now I&#x27;ve been pinned to a wall with the choice of breaking my religious values, that again, ive upheld my entire life, values she knew of, respected, and accepted, or lose the person I care more about than anyone else in the entire world. I dont know what to do. I&#x27;ve considered breaking parts of the religion, like maybe shabbat, but every time it just makes me feel awful. At the same time, the thought of losing her also makes me feel awful. It&#x27;s just such a shitty situation made worse by outside influence and its literally fucking up our lives. We haven&#x27;t slept in the same bed for almost a week, little to no contact with each other other than small conversations but otherwise just nothing. I want this to work with her, I want a life with her and I know she wants one with me, but contingent on me breaking my religion. I&#x27;ve told her that if she wants to go do things on shabbat, or eat at a place that isn&#x27;t kosher or whatever, go ahead. It would obviously hurt me but I wouldnt leave her over it. But no, she wants to do those things with me, which I get. I want to do those things with her too but I &quot;cant&quot; because of my beliefs. So her doing those things without me is not an option for her. It&#x27;s either I give it up and it&#x27;s all or nothing.   


I just dont know what to do and I guess needed to vent this out and hopefully get some opinions or thoughts on the situation outside of just my own head. So, any thoughts?  </div>

            <div class="content collapsed">How to help my mom (F45) out ? 

Posted earlier but got deleted for name or something idk first time posting ! 

Ever since my mom got her new boyfriend Shane (M39 )about 5 years ago I’ve noticed she was starting to gain weight fast , She was always extremely thin and had barely any fat on her , I didn’t know what to think of it but she sat me down recently and told me how she’s going to get much much bigger as shane is what you call a feeder and wants her to gain more weight as he likes bigger women . He has now gotten her to start taking mass gainer protein shakes very regularly like I always see her drinking it probably 3-4 times a day Now I’ve seen Shane’s exes before and they’re all like formerly super slim women who got huge and that scares me . Constantly I see shane bringing he cheese cakes as he knows that’s her favorite and not like slices the man is buying her whole cheese cakes and that lasts her like 2 days and he’s now starting making comments how that outfits getting so tight on you we’d have to buy you new clothes and he’s like always rubbing her stomach now and squeezing her and bringing her seconds after she finishes eating . It’s just scary because my mom was formerly so slim and trim and now she’s gaining weight like crazy she told me that she’s planning on reaching around 200–230 and stopping but I feel like that’s a lie as she’s now readily enjoying gaining weight , thing is my mom has high blood pressure so you can see the weight gain is really affecting her. She’s always huffing and puffing now . Shane is very slim and loves from my mom to sit on him and just recently I overheard him saying to her when she sat on him oh, she’s getting so fat and overweight and pretty soon he won’t be able to take her weight anymore and that he cannot wait to hold his woman when she’s gains some more weight and she was gassing him up saying how she’s going to get so huge she’ll suffocate him. I really don’t feel like shane is a good influence on my mom as she’s really gullible and is putting her Health at risk she doesn’t even do her daily workouts anymore and has now opted to over eating consistently and she’s <mark>blow</mark>ing up help life is now junk food and honestly the public displays of affection is really annoying because Shane’s always grabbing her fattier areas and always trying to make her a “jiggle “ . She’s now sporting a full on gigantic gut that just spills over all her clothes now and it doesn’t help that she wears tight older clothes more as her arms and boobs are now extremely huge as well 
And they weren’t before i’ve tried to talk to her several times on this matter, and she told me it’s her body

TLDR - My mom started dating this guy named Shane who’s forcing her in the 5 years they’ve been together to gain massive amounts of weight</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">**TLDR: My ex boyfriend sexually assaulted me in my sleep when I was 19 &amp; he was 17. This happened in May 2022. I didn’t report anything because I had no evidence &amp; felt like because I was an adult and he was a minor. I was doing well starting my healing process from it, but my name is still in his mouth and I keep hearing new false info he’s spreading. My family isn’t supportive of the situation either. What should I do?**  
*This is a long story, so if you don’t want to read the whole thing just read TLDR. If I update you on anything, it will be located under this message.*   
**Updates:**  
Hi Redditors,  
If you like stories, this is for you. To start this off, I’m going to give some background. In early 2021, my cousin introduced me to a few of his friends on Discord. During this time I met my now ex boyfriend, who we will call ***Nate***. Nate is two years younger than me. His best friend, who we will call Jake, is also a big part of the story.   
When we all met, we became really close friends pretty quickly. We were kind of a trio. But we also had separate friendships with one another. I was close with each of them too. I never really felt feelings for either of them in the beginning, it was purely platonic.   
After some alone time with Nate, we became inseparable. We were extremely close and were texting 24/7. Our friendship was always healthy, never any issues that we faced. It just seemed like a perfect friendship to me. Nate was the ‘softboy’ type of guy. So most of our banter was about things I would talk about. He almost made it feel like we were the same person a lot of the time. He was extremely sweet and understanding. He was the closest friend I had at the time, so I valued him the most. He gave me the opportunity to be vulnerable and talk about the hardships of my past with him. Before him, I was a closed book. I was learning to trust again because of Nate.  
On the other side of things, Jake was completely different. Our friendship was a lot more of a joking manner, more playful and fun. I had enjoyed the company of both of them in different ways. But he was different. Jake had a harder time talking about his feelings and personal life, so I was determined to help him open up to me. I liked being there to listen and be a good friend, be someone he could go to when he needed me. I took this relationship with Jake as seriously as possible because I know what it felt like to be in his position, I just wanted to be his true friend.  
July 2021, Jake had told me he fell for me. Nate did NOT know about this. Once Nate heard about it, he was pretty silent with both of us for about a week. I had liked Nate but I wasn’t sure how I felt about Jake falling for me. I was really upset at the time because I felt like I had done something wrong, Nate wouldn’t speak to me like he normally would. A few days later, he finally came out and told me he had fallen for me too. I was so confused on how this had happened. I didn’t know how these two best friends hadn’t communicated it to each other. What was I supposed to do now knowing this?   
Eventually, they had told each other how they both felt about me. Unfortunately, they talked about it and decided I had to choose between them. My first reaction to this was to just leave them both. I didn’t want to make a choice between two of my close friends. I felt like everything was my fault and I had come between them without realizing. I didn’t know what to do for a really long time. I was very upset with this whole situation. I ended up dissociating really badly because of the stress and pressure I felt I was under during this. It lasted a few days before I finally could resume thinking about what I needed to do, what was best for me. I ended up just telling them both I needed to leave their lives. I couldn’t handle making a choice that I was <mark>forced</mark> into making. It was so unfair. Not long after that, both had messaged me saying similar things. Jake told me he was in love with me, Nate saying the same thing but in a more manipulative way. He had told me he was considering suicide because of losing me, because of everything that was happening. I knew this was a manipulation tactic, but at the time I was more concerned about his well being than being manipulated. I trusted that I could help him get better, considering I’ve been through it. So we became friends again, this was around September 2021.   
During October, we had started becoming super close again and I ended up developing feelings for Nate. I kept it private for a while because I knew the situation was sticky. We ended up meeting in person and went out to eat. It was a pretty good day. We enjoyed each other&#x27;s company a lot. We started seeing each other every weekend throughout the month, and started dating in November 2021. We kept this a secret to protect Jake’s feelings. I still felt very guilty about all of this even though I wasn’t sure if I should. He started talking really badly about Jake and feeding me information that he was saying about me. Nate told me that Jake only wanted to use me for my body (I never sent pictures), and that he hated me and called me all these bad things behind my back the whole time. I believed him because I had left them. I truly thought Jake hated my guts for leaving him, and I seriously didn’t blame him. I would hate being left once I connected with someone too.   
Once we got into a relationship, everything had changed. He was very loving before, but suddenly he became super different. It was just so odd to me. He wouldn’t come over as much anymore, he wasn’t ever paying for food or dates, I never received a single gift until Christmas, he NEVER invited me to his home. We met each other’s families and all was well, so I never understood why. It all just felt really one sided. I was doing everything for him, my family welcomed him with open arms. My mom would buy him things too, feed him. I would pay for everything he wanted. I even pitched in money to help him pay for a PC. I spent loads on this boy when I didn’t get a single thing in return. Not that I need gifts, but I just wanted to feel appreciated or loved. The sexual acts were also SO one sided. I was always giving, never receiving no matter how many times I asked. It started to just become gross. I was starting to feel like I was being taken advantage of. I talked about it with him briefly, explaining that I don’t expect him to return the favors, but I just needed some reassurance that I wasn’t just <mark>blow</mark>ing my money on some guy who didn’t care about me anymore, and he actually wanted to be with me. He told me nothing had changed with how he felt about me so we went on and continued dating. I trusted him.  
At the end of April 2022, I was opening up to him about something extremely sentimental to me overnight. I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I decided we were at the point in our relationship where I felt it was right to tell him this. He opened it and responded early in the morning. I received a photograph of his burrito. His breakfast burrito. That’s it. He didn’t take me seriously at the time I needed him the most. And all of what I felt prior to this, it just immediately made me feel disgusted by him. I talked to him about how his response made me feel, he took it as a joke. I gave it until right before my 19th birthday, just to see if something would change. It didn’t. So I broke up with him about 4-5 days before my birthday. I still cared for him even though I was so hurt by him. I told him if he still wanted to attend, he could. I was prepared to be friendly with him and not have bad blood even knowing how hurt I was. The plan was, I invited my friends and Nate to dinner. We were all going back to my house to smoke and drink, celebrate. Some were planning to stay overnight, others weren’t. At the time, Nate didn’t drive. He didn’t have a ride home so he stayed overnight as well. He also doesn’t smoke or drink, so he was sober the ENTIRE night. I was not. I was living it up with my friends, until about 1AM. Most of them had left, and the three that decided to stay over had gone up to bed. Nate and I were left alone in my basement to talk. We had a heart to heart about everything that had happened and he kept asking me if we could get back together. I told him no each time. I wasn’t ready to commit until I knew he was going to change how he treats me.   
Before I knew it, one thing had led to another and we started hooking up. This WAS consensual, but I was also under the influence, so take that as you will. All we did was oral and he finished, so I put on a movie and started to go to sleep. He shook me awake and asked me if I wanted to have sex. We were both virgins at the time. I agreed to try and asked my friends if they could throw down condoms from my bedroom. I got them and we tried for about 15 minutes before I said I didn’t want to anymore. I just wasn’t feeling it with him, I was crossed, and I just wanted to go to sleep. We stopped and I went right to sleep around 3AM. The next morning, he shook me awake again because my mom was going to drive him home. It was like 9AM, so I was so fucked the next morning. Hungover and confused. As soon as I moved from being woken up, the first words out of his mouth, and I quote, were, “Hey, I’m sorry but I touched you in your sleep last night.” I didn’t even process what he had said because I wasn’t fully awake yet. I just said, “Okay.” And got up to get ready to leave. On the way to his house, I kind of just sat there thinking about what he had said and I started to get kind of upset. I remember looking at him and just wondering why he would think that would be okay to do. I wanted to know what he did to me, because I didn’t know anything but that he “touched” me. I dropped him off, and went home and that was the last time I ever saw him. I didn’t tell anybody for a few days because I was thinking it’s probably my own fault. I must’ve given him mixed signals to make him think it was okay to touch me. I wasn’t sure. I texted my friends on June 1st, who were there. I wanted their opinion on the matter. They told me I should probably report it or tell my parents. They confirmed that it was definitely not my fault because I wasn’t conscious. I could not consent to being “touched”. I was sexually assaulted in my sleep by my ex boyfriend. Once I realized how bad it was, I completely wanted him to leave me alone forever. I didn’t want to rekindle a single thing, I didn’t want to fix anything between us, I wanted him to fuck off FOREVER.   
Throughout the following months, he would text me, my sister, my mom, and my friends trying to get back into my life. He was stalking me online and my friends. It was so weird and I was so uncomfortable. There was one time I responded to him and said to leave me alone and stop messaging my family and friends because it was weird. I wanted space from him. I didn’t want him around anyone I cared about. I was becoming so depressed because this wasn’t the first time this had happened to me. Knowing what happened to me as a child, he went and did something just as bad if not worse. Time passed so slowly after this. I didn’t know what I was doing and I was hitting rock bottom again. I was so disgusted with myself that I let this happen again. I was so pissed at myself for trusting someone I shouldn’t have. I KNEW how manipulative he was and I chose to see the good in him. I regret everything instantly.   
Summer passed, and Nate finally left me alone after a few months. September 2022 hit, and I got a message from Jake. He asked me if we could talk. I hopped into a call with him and we talked for hours. Turns out, Nate lied to us about everything. Jake had never said any of what Nate claimed he had. What’s really funny, was Nate was also feeding the same info to Jake about me. Telling him I was grossed out by him and hated his guts and I thought these nasty things about him. It all started to add up, and I was so fucking mad. I didn’t know what else Nate had lied about, I questioned our whole relationship now. I shared with him what Nate had done to me, what he told me about Jake, and the truth about everything. Jake did the same. We kept this private as well, we didn’t want Nate to find out that I told Jake. They were still friends. We kept a very low profile for a few months while trying to gather as much proof as we could find. We had a plan to report this, I wanted him to pay for the pain I was going through. I wanted to make sure he couldn’t do this to another woman. With time, we gathered a lot of screenshots and messages. I had one photo of the marks that Nate had left on my chest, but it wasn’t solid evidence of sexual assault. It was pretty much my word against his because what we had wasn’t good enough. We got more people who knew him involved. Jake got some of his friends in on it to try to record him confessing. Nate was going around in school asking if anyone knew about “him sexually assaulting me”. After a lot of time passed, about 4 different stories were told to me that came from Nate. He would tell them what happened that night, but not the full truth at all. He also forgot to mention the important parts! I won’t get into every one he told, but just know none of them were what had actually happened that night. With all of this new info, I didn’t know what to do anymore and I felt helpless. I had nothing to give police if I wanted this to actually be pursued. I thought it wouldn’t even be worth it because he was just turning 17 and I was just turning 19. I just gave up.  
Before I knew it, my mental health was declining so much more so quickly. I couldn’t handle finding out all the info everyday. I just wanted to stop dealing with this situation. I decided it was best for me to just cut off everyone involved and try to forget about it and heal on my own. I have not spoken to anyone involved since November 2022. I reached out to a SA specialized therapist in my area that could provide me with the support I needed. It was time to stop being so hateful with him. I started realizing that I cannot change what happened already, I felt   
Fast forward to present time, it’s June 2023. I’ve made a lot of progress in my journey of being a SA survivor. I’m in a new, ACTUALLY healthy relationship with a man I love more than myself. He treats me so much better and I’ve learned a lot of do’s and don’ts from my ex. My current boyfriend knows about the whole situation already. He is very understanding with my boundaries and insecurities from my past. I’m a lot happier than I was back then, and I feel like a lot of healing has happened without even realizing.   
Yet, the situation still comes back and haunts me to this day. Just a few days ago, my cousin told me one of Nate’s friends tricked him into getting on a phone call with Nate. Apparently he was trying to get my cousin to believe that he’s innocent and kept asking him, “But you don’t believe her right?” He was also straight up lying to him when he was explaining the situation. My friends were there, my parents, and sister. They KNOW he was there overnight. He was saying, “How would I even break in there to touch her?” Or “I walked away and nothing happened.” It makes me feel like shit because not only is he lying to everyone, it makes me feel like what he did to me was something I made up, something that didn’t really happen. It makes my experience with him feel like I still don’t suffer because of the mental pain I go through every single day of my life. It makes me hate him more. He did nothing to me prior to this situation, nothing bad enough to have me falsely accuse him of something so vile. It’s so extremely painful. I’ve been doing my best to move on from this and I think I’ve made significant progress. I don’t really know how to continue to deal with this, I thought it was over. And to make it worse, My mom keeps telling me to forget about it, it’s not a big deal, move on from it, and tell me that I can’t let it bother me. How do I stay unbothered by someone trying to spread false information to my friends and family? How do I forget I was taken advantage of, with someone I trusted? How is this not a big deal? This changed me. It’s so fucking invalidating to hear. It hurts me really bad and makes me so angry. I feel like she isn’t listening to me, like she doesn’t care about how it affects me at all. Why even say that, does she understand the severity of the situation for her daughter??? She knows I’ve been through this, why is it so hard to just be supportive? All I needed was some reinforcement, some kind words, or even just a hug. But no.  
Of course I want to move on from this but it is not that easy to do so. There are going to be times where I’m reminded of what happened, or trauma that lingers from those experiences affecting me later on. I know it will because it’s happened already. It happens everyday. And to hear that I need to ‘get over it’ is possibly one of the cruelest things I’ve ever heard.  
Either way, the reason I’m writing all this to you guys today is because I just wanna hear some other opinions about the situation. I want honest answers from people who don’t really know me. BE HONEST please. Thank you for reading if you made it this far, much appreciation :)  
**Is this worth pursuing legal action over, if so can I?**  
**Is there anything I can do to help myself?**  
**What should I do to heal from this?**  
**Should I really just ‘move on’?**  
**Am I being too sensitive about this?**

            <div class="content collapsed">We’ve been dating for almost 5 years now. We met in 2018, the worst year of my life by far. In 2018, my ex of 9 years and I broke up, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, had credit card debt, and I had just experienced a bear market.

I met my current gf towards the end of the year. 

Whenever we argue, I’m always extremely patient (learned it from my last relationship). I don’t call names, I don’t insult, I don’t yell. 

I always try to speak to my SO as an adult and try to have a calm discussion. I’ve always looked at arguments as caused by one person disagreeing with something that was said or done. The way to resolve it is to focus on the problem, IMO, while both sides come to a conclusion. 

In 2019, my gf found out I had credit card debt that I had trouble paying off so she helped me. I got my financial life together after that. I mention this because I’ve always felt this had some influence on why our relationship is the way it is. 

But whenever we argue, she constantly <mark>blow</mark>s up, yells at me, tells me to “fuck off” and “leave me the fuck alone.” She also likes to tell me to “go back to New York.” (I moved to a different state for her). 

She then proceeds to lock herself in the room and if I try to comfort her, she yells at me. I learned to give her space as time went on. But if I leave her alone and let her come to me, she’ll say “you don’t care, you didn’t even try.”

Last year, we went to Miami and I met up friends I haven’t seen in 5 years. I decided to treat them to a table at a club. My gf was livid (and probably <mark>drunk</mark>). She ended up pouring a cup of water on me while yelling in front of EVERYONE, then stormed out of the club. 

Obviously I didn’t go chasing, but once we were done and I got back to the Airbnb around 4am, I find out that she locked me out of the Airbnb. I was banging on the door for 30 minutes before she finally decided to open the door. 

There was another time we got into an argument while out with friends and she left early because of it. I came home to find out she locked me out of the apartment. 

Every time we argue, I always end up apologizing even when I KNOW I’m not at fault and things escalated for no reason. 

She never apologizes for anything unless I force it out. And sometimes when she does, she’ll say “I didn’t start the argument. I didn’t do/say this/that”

There are times when she <mark>blow</mark>s up so much she starts throwing things around her. 

Recently, we got into a huge argument about marriage A DAY after I got back from vacation and  she essentially gave me an ultimatum about proposing. 

The argument got so heated that I ended up <mark>sleeping</mark> in my car for the night. I broke down and couldn’t take it anymore. I ended up putting a gun to my head until I cried out to my deceased grandmother begging for some type of guidance. 

We got into another argument last week and I never planned on telling her what happened that night. This argument was about how I was driving (the same way I do every time she’s in the car) and it completely blew up once again with her constantly yelling. During the heat of it, I just blurted it out and told her I put a gun to my head the week prior after our argument. 

When she got out of the car, she angrily said “I don’t date stupid people” and stormed off. She proceeded to text my mom in a group chat to tell her what happened and essentially broke up with me through text (although this is not confirmed because she tends to say extreme things &amp; things she regrets when she’s angry)

I haven’t seen her since because I went on another trip and I’m 2 hours from meeting her again. We also live together. 

Not sure what to do. There’s so much more but this is enough.</div>

            <div class="content collapsed">In the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, my husband&#x27;s government job mandated vaccination. He chose not to get vaccinated and was later terminated. We were closing on our first home at this time, so we were left scrambling to qualify for a mortgage on my sole income, and finances were tight. This was also a very stressful time since my husband couldn&#x27;t enter establishments without a vaccine card so our options for socialization and decompression were limited, and some friends even stopped inviting us to gatherings because of his lack of vaccination. I know for sure he felt sad and isolated due to his stance, and this is when he turned to some online communities to find people who shared his beliefs. 

I then started to notice his vernacular change - he would refer to vaccination as &quot;poison&quot;, use terms like &quot;plandemic&quot;, and repeat false information such as the vaccine as the cause of death for certain celebrities or athletes. He started to follow many right-winged social media pages (ex: Jordan Peterson, Rebel News etc.), and even joined a large Whatsapp group named &quot;The Sheepless&quot; which is a group of people against vaccination that circulate false articles and conspiracy theories in a chat.

Here&#x27;s the thing - I work in the medical field. I have 3 science degrees and a graduate level education. I worked throughout the thick of the pandemic and would come home burnt out after having Covid positive patients die on my shift from respiratory arrest after spending hours in PPE and watching their families suffer. However, as my husband got more and more into his newfound community, he started to question what I experienced firsthand in the hospital. He would tell me that he &quot;did some research&quot; and the hospitals are actually empty. His research entailed scrolling social media pages. He has yet to read just one scientific article in a peer reviewed journal about respiratory viruses or mRNA vaccines. He also started to challenge my scientific knowledge. He&#x27;d say things like the vaccine has &quot;changed my DNA&quot; and I should check to see if I can still get pregnant since the vaccine causes infertility. When I debunked his theories using actual literature, his response was the articles I read are funded by the government or they&#x27;re &quot;the white man&#x27;s science&quot;. Yes, we&#x27;re both POC.

His beliefs have now expanded into an overarching fear of government control. We&#x27;re Canadian so he believes Trudeau is trying to turn our country communist and implement a social credit system to limit &quot;our rights and freedoms&quot;. He&#x27;s become increasingly more radicalized, and has talked about moving to a rural area so we can farm and grow our own foods so when the government shuts down our ability to buy food in grocery stores, we&#x27;ll be &quot;ready&quot;. He talks about the World Economic Forum&#x27;s &quot;master plan&quot; to annihilate everyone&#x27;s finances by purposely causing inflation and all the &quot;hidden files&quot; about vaccine side effects that are being suppressed.

We&#x27;ve essentially had at least one weekly <mark>blow</mark>-up fight about his conspiracy theories over the last year.   My fear is that we&#x27;ve grown incompatible due to the pandemic. He never once expressed anti-vaccine or even anti-government rhetoric until he was terminated from his job for not adhering to the policies. Now we&#x27;re wondering how we could possibly have children when our beliefs have diverged. He says he&#x27;d still be open for our kids to get the &quot;tried and true&quot; vaccinations, but he wouldn&#x27;t want them to get anything new. He also says he wouldn&#x27;t want to raise children in a place like Canada because our leader is tyrannical.

I think he has developed PTSD and maybe some sort of delusional disorder due to the trauma of losing his job.  He&#x27;s done 2 sessions with a psychologist, but his beliefs remain stronger than ever. I don&#x27;t want to walk away, especially due to what I perceive to be mental illness, but I just don&#x27;t know how much more I can take of him undermining my knowledge.

I&#x27;ll take any suggestions at this point. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

Edit: Thank you everyone, your comments have been helpful. I showed my husband this post. Here is his side of the story.

Wife F31 thinks I&#x27;m M33 a conspiracy theorist. Calls me right wing. It bothers me that she labels me, ignores and denounces the weight of major revelations that oppose her beliefs/occupational knowledge/geopolitical understanding

Very important decisions are being made by the few elites for the many.

My wife thinks I am unwell because I have an issue with this current gov. administration and their hardcore policy&#x27;s/corruption. Apparently I&#x27;m a problem because I don&#x27;t want to follow their direction of proven criminals. 

Numerous scanals aside, They manufacture inflation through policy. Creating desperation and crime. They offer the solution but they are the ones creating the problems, in doing so forcing their mandate and agenda. This solution will be sold to us as convenience and for our health and safety but it is not about that. As a collective we will either, put a collar around our necks for the will of the gov and elite to pick up the leash whenever or we can all wake up to what is happening and reject policy that designed to continue to reduce our freedoms.

It has been written that our neighboring leaders committed an act of war, betrayal and one of the biggest environmental disasters in history (see Sy Hersh report) and shamelessly at the same time want to tell the 99% of people to reduce carbon footprint, all while flying the world in their private jets pushing their agenda for dominance. They don&#x27;t care about your health or the environment. Seems to me like treason and global domination. How they got common folk to support this or be okay with is beyond me but wow. Msm media brainwash is strong. Thank Twitter and socials for the remaining shreds of truth about our leaders. Oh yeah, did I mention they work for wef, not the people. Again treason. 

I chose to not take the jab to preserve my health instead of inoculation against a non-imminent threat using a rushed concoction. This is not apples and oranges in there, this does come with side effects, which we are learning about know, see Thailand news, VAERS and Dr. John Campbell &quot;Pf press release continues&quot; from two weeks ago (Dr. Throughout this reversed opinion, now sharing facts. YT). Not to mention my religious values. A good salesman will rush you to decide before you have carefully considered what you&#x27;re buying. Informed consent is important. More information is out now. Inform and consent to more shots, if that is your prerogative. 

No one likes a know it all. Throughout the controversy that is the last 3 years there have been polarizing topics. When one side of the conversation censors and degrades the other and claims that they know what is right for all. To me that is a red flag. I don&#x27;t see why that is not a concern for alot of people. Why would asking questions be frowned on? I myself have felt censored throughout this as I have had question and concerns and instead I am labeled degrading names.

I do not draw a dividing line between what is left and what is right but I understand what is right and wrong and what I consider to be extreme behavior. Whether this is extremely for an particular ideology or extremely complacent and careless of major revelations conducive to sound decision making and future trajectory. I believe that we should not trust the solutions to our problems offered to us from the source creation of the same problems. (ask me if you&#x27;re confused) The fearful, complacent and ill informed are going to vote and comply our way into a very tight spot that we may find next to impossible to argue our way out of when we all find our bs limit. 

Check the Globe and Mail/CSIS - China installment - this is who everyone is taking orders from. He is bought and paid for. If you watch msm You&#x27;re peddling his bs for free. Thank a main stream media. Their propaganda is strong. Pay attention to the real news from real people. I recommend reddit. Our n8tion is bullys. As the 99.9% We are all getting bullied. I&#x27;m not the problem, the 0.01% is and their ever reaching influence over us the people. Divide and conquer. Works every time. Canada is divided and the people are weak. 

I&#x27;m just trying to do what I think is best for everyone. Stand up for your freedoms and rights or sacrifice them because you are scared or don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ve seen the result of poor making and their die-hard supporters. 

Who&#x27;s war are you fighting when attacking others over their medical decisions? What is the character of the people implementing these policy that you support.
 
Do they care about you? 
Do I care about you? 

I am a man of the people and I want everyone to live their own private lives and prosper.

I believed in the charter of rights and freedoms. Now, not so much. 

Don&#x27;t be complacent.

I want my wife to understand the system she support but I feel like she is in favor of the elite&#x27;s agenda and wants to see a future with more government interference.

Governments have worked for the people. It seems that they are trying to change that and I am not okay with that.

            <div class="content collapsed">TLDR at the bottom

This weekend, I&#x27;m going to visit my old college town and meet up with two of my closest college friends, &quot;Kayla&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle.&quot; There&#x27;s just one sticky issue and for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out what the right thing to do is. 

For some background, there was another friend in our group &quot;Mary.&quot; We were all very close in college, Gabrielle and Mary particularly. Mary came from a religious family and when we started school, she went looking for a church group. The one she eventually joined seemed cool- the group was diverse and young and welcoming of physical self-expression. Well, I don&#x27;t want to drag this story out so I&#x27;ll simplify events. One small group a week was eventually joined by the bigger mass every weekend. Then a smaller group bible study a different day. Then another thing and another thing and another thing.

Things got weird. The church group got controlling and manipulative. They got in Mary&#x27;s head. Some of the... unique... things they believed freaked us out. Mary would unexpectedly bring some of them to our friend things sometimes and it just felt off.

The thing was, it happened so slowly. So gradually. But by the end of senior year, Mary was in a full <mark>blow</mark>n cult. But what could I do? By the time I grasped the magnitued of the situation, they had their hooks in her. All I could do is keep being her friend on her terms. I&#x27;ll be honest though, her valuing the friendship less did make me feel a bit hurt by the time we graduated.

Kayla and I moved away after graduation and Gabrielle and Mary stayed in the same city where we all went to college.

I don&#x27;t invest anything in that friendship anymore, outside of a few texts and skypes over the years, but we were really close for those years in college. We have some great memories and she&#x27;s talked about getting back together for a college girls trip as much as me. I was fully prepared to let bygones be bygones.

After years of &quot;we need to get together!!!&quot; this past spring I finally just pulled the trigger and put a real plan in place. I did not include Mary on the group text because as the least reliable one, I didn&#x27;t want to rely on her participation. But I fully planned to let her know when I was coming and include her. Mary lives nearby and could just join whatever activity she wanted to join. But then Gabrielle told me something upsetting. 

After I&#x27;d moved away, Mary sat Gabrielle down and said, &quot;we can&#x27;t be friends anymore because you&#x27;re getting in the way of my relationship with God.&quot; Gabrielle isn&#x27;t religious but she strictly followed the same protocol as Kayla and I- no badmouthing her church group or else we&#x27;d push Mary right into their grasping claws. But this was a classic cult manipulation tactic.

With unbelievable grace, Gabrielle said she&#x27;d go along with whatever everyone else wants this weekend and we could still invite Mary. Obviously, I&#x27;m not going to force Gabrielle to hang out with Mary. It felt shady but I decided the best course of action would be to just move forward with the plans without Mary. Even though I know she&#x27;d want to be included.

I know because she texted us only a few weeks after (by coincidence) to let us know a) sorry but we weren&#x27;t invited to her upcoming wedding (which honestly didn&#x27;t offend me) and b) we need to get a plan together to meet up. It was met with a very awkward lack of response, except Kayla who hearted the text.

Well, now the weekend is almost here and I&#x27;m burdened by guilt and shame. It feels underhanded to just fly there and home without saying anything. All of her college friends gathering right under her nose without her would be a real slap in the face and far meaner than anything she&#x27;s ever done to me. How could I say &quot;i&#x27;ll be there&quot; but make it clear she&#x27;s not part of things? At least not all the things we&#x27;re doing. That seems even bitchier. I&#x27;d love to grab coffee or lunch with her at some point to catch up. But Kayla will want to come too and then it&#x27;ll just be weird if Gabrielle is the only one who doesn&#x27;t. Then we&#x27;d just leave and go hang out together without her...?

More importantly, since she&#x27;s still in the cult (her new husband is too from what I&#x27;ve heard), I want to make it clear that I&#x27;ll always be here. She&#x27;ll always have someone on the &quot;outside&quot; who loves her. It kills me to think that one day, the brainwash will start to falter, and she&#x27;ll look around to see that she systematically cut off every single connection to anything that isn&#x27;t the cult. It may not be much and we may not be close, but I&#x27;ll be that stubborn little wart that the church just can&#x27;t seem to burn off. 

But Gabrielle and her feelings are my priority. Mary should not be invited to the whole weekend because, while I&#x27;m trying to show grace and patience myself, Mary made her bed. Also, there&#x27;s a chance church people will come with her as &quot;friends&quot; but, as was the case in college, I suspect will really be there to watch her and steer her away from &quot;sin&quot; and outside influence. I can deal with cult people at a coffee meeting but I don&#x27;t want them on our halloween bar crawl.

What the hell do I do? Do I say anything to Mary? Do I get coffee with her? If I do, how do I let her know I&#x27;ll always be her connection on the outside without implying her church is a cult (cults hate being called cults)? Should I just <mark>blow</mark> her off completely? What do I do if she texts me while I&#x27;m there or after because someone posts something about it? 

Gabrielle has said it&#x27;s up to Kayla and me. Kayla tends to be a follower in matters such as these. So it looks like it&#x27;s all up to me. No matter what I do, hurt will be inflicted. I just want to inflict the least hurt possible.

TLDR; I&#x27;m flying to meet up with college friends this weekend in our college town but one friend wasn&#x27;t invited. She joined a cult and cut off one of the friends. They both still live in that town. I feel morally conflicted about visiting without saying anything.

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for their input. There were varied opinions and I took it all to heart. I have decided not to invite Mary to any of the group activities. I should have mentioned in my post but I will be staying with Gabrielle while I&#x27;m there (as will Kayla). I&#x27;m still too wrapped up in caring about her feelings since she was rejected so bluntly. She may have said it&#x27;s fine but she always puts on a tough exterior. But I know her well enough to see through it- she has tells and that rejection cut deeply.

I heard what people said about accepting the friendship is probably dead so I&#x27;m going to prioritize the feelings of Gabrielle.

However, I also heard the people who said I can&#x27;t just <mark>blow</mark> off Mary completely. After I arrive and get a feel for the schedule, im going to see if she wants to grab coffee/breakfast on Saturday morning (I&#x27;ll be gone too early on Sunday). Gabrielle and Kayla can independently decide if they want to go. While there, I will reiterate how I will still be there if things ever get rough. As many suggested, I will also make it clear I don&#x27;t want her to bring anyone.</div>
