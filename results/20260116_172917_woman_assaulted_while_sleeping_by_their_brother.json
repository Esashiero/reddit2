    "content": "this breaks me to write but i need to know if i would be wrong \n\ni (17 f) have a few siblings but only my sisters matter. my oldest sister (24 f) well call her haley and my other older sister (19f) well call her sophia. and one more significant person in the story is my brother in law (24 m) well call him micheal. so haley and micheal have been married a couple years and he\u2019s been with haley since i was around 11-12 so he\u2019s been a part of my life and very long time and has basically watched me grow up. me and sophia went to haley and micheal\u2019s to go spend the weekend with them and in the night of december 9th 2022 micheal decided to sexually assault me when he thought i was sleeping. the next morning i went and ran errands with haley to get away from him for as long as i could without setting off alarms in anyone\u2019s head. so we did our thing and when we got back sophia decided it was time for us to head back to her house and all that. so we leave and as we\u2019re leaving town i break down into tears and tell sophia everything. completely panicked she calls her dad and we head to his house and then call my mother who decides to round everyone up at her house (me sophia and haley pretty much) and have me tell haley what happened. you could barely understand what i was saying through the panic attack and tears but eventually i got it all out and haley said that she thought i was dreaming because he\u2019d told her i was shaking in my sleep trying to cover his own tracks and said she believed that whatever happened to me definitely hurt me but didn\u2019t think micheal would ever do anything like that so she went back home to him to confront him and i went to the hospital to get a rape kit done and when she confronted him he didn\u2019t wanna listen to what she had to ask and was freaking out and throwing up and all that and would t admit to anything when eventually it all winded down and he just looked at her and said \u201ci fucked up\u201d\n\nhaley immediately left for sophia\u2019s house and sophia called me and my mom and said he basically admitted to it and haley was with her. so i feel immediate relief and happy she\u2019s away from this sick monster. sophia ended up calling micheal and cursing him out and he said to her \u201ci was drunk\u201d basically admitting it for a second time in front of my uncle aunt and cousin as well who was in there room with sophia\n\nmeanwhile i\u2019m being evaluated and what comes back is that i have bruises and scratches where they should not have been and eventually it would come back that there was two sets of male dna on all of my clothing one set on my shirt (could have been literally anyone) and one set inside my underwear (not matched but we all know it was micheal\u2019s)\n\nhaley ended up talking to micheal the next day. he said he only said all of that because he was scared and she believed him. she came over to my house to tell me she didn\u2019t believe me call me a liar and psychotic and left. we haven\u2019t spoken since. \n\nthere\u2019s so much more to this story than i can even get into (like me leaving my comfort blanket which i can\u2019t sleep without at her apartment that day and her just throwing it away) but it\u2019d be way longer than this already is. my entire family thinks i should have sympathy for her because she\u2019s trying to hold onto her marriage but i see this as unacceptable and the worst form of betrayal so i decided when it\u2019s all over and the trials complete i will not ever be speaking to my sister again. my family thinks i\u2019m heartless and that it\u2019s unacceptable to never talk or see her again but i think it\u2019s for the best.

    "content": "Hi everyone, sorry for the throwaway account. I've been trying to find the words to talk to my husband about some tough issues in my past, and this morning I wrote something that I think helps explain what I'm dealing with. I'm trying to find the courage to send this to him, but I'm scared he won't \"get it.\" As unbiased outside observers, does what I wrote make sense? Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this.\n\n>I have an old injury\u2014when I was 11 years old, I badly sprained my left ankle playing soccer. I don\u2019t remember much of the actual injury, but I remember sitting on the sidelines with my foot stabilized on top of a shoe while the coach got me some ice. Later, I remember my orthopedist telling me that the injury would heal, but that I would probably have a weak left ankle for the rest of my life. As it turns out, he was right. Twenty years later, when hiking, walking, or running, I occasionally feel a twinge in my ankle, the muscles give out and my foot rolls outward. I am always able to recover, and I haven\u2019t had any significant pain in that ankle since I sprained it, but the possibility is always there. And the possibility of that old injury reemerging will always be there, for the rest of my life.\n\n>I have an old injury\u2014when I was 11 years old, my brother sexually assaulted me several times while I slept in my bedroom. I remember vivid details, like the pale yellow pajamas I wore to bed: the shirt had \u00be length sleeves and a button-up v-neck, the bottoms were shorts, and all over was a small floral print of tiny pink and green flowers. I remember my brother\u2019s boxers on the floor: not crumpled up or folded, but pulled down and stepped out of. I remember forcing myself to stay awake until my brother had gone to bed. I remember going to my mom and faking an asthma attack so she would stay awake with me. I remember sleeping with the light on so my brother wouldn\u2019t come into my room. I remember turning away from him, pretending to be asleep, hoping he would leave. I tried to learn how to sleep on my stomach. Most of all, to this day I have a visceral, physical reaction when being touched underneath my clothes\u2014I feel frozen, and violated. \n\n>I have an old injury\u2014when I was 14, I tried to tell my mom about the assaults. I sat at the kitchen table for hours, crying, not able to get the words out. I was scared, ashamed, and confused. I told my dad to leave the room. When I finally got the words out, she told me to \u201cstop lying\u201d and berated me for making something up that \u201ccould ruin your brother\u2019s life.\u201d I told her about the boxers, and she said she probably dropped them while doing laundry. I told her about the faked asthma attacks, and she just shook her head. She accused me of lying to get attention. A stinging shock wave blasted through me over and over again, and I sobbed harder. My chest screamed out in pain. I went upstairs to my room, locked the door, and played angry, loud, painful music. I took scissors and cut my arms until they bled. To stop myself, I took scissors and carved gashes in my bedside table instead. I screamed into my pillow. I literally felt like I was losing my mind. Maybe I was lying... Did it actually happen? I questioned everything.\n \n>I didn\u2019t speak to my parents for awhile, and I fell further into a severe depression. I withdrew from everything. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents about this since it happened, nor my brother. The only person in my life that I\u2019ve ever told is my husband, and it took me 7 years to tell him. It took 15 years for me to finally get help for my depression. Today, I am terrified of telling people how I feel. I am terrified of asking for help. I feel this old injury every single day. I hold my feelings inside, bury them down as far as they will go. Everything is my fault, I don\u2019t deserve what I have. I question everything. I have no confidence. Writing this, I am nauseated, and my body feels like I jumped into an icy lake. \n\n>I am trying. I am trying. I am trying so hard. I don\u2019t cut anymore, I have more confidence, I\u2019m changing my life bit by bit. I want to build stronger armor, be more resilient. But I feel this old injury every day of my life, I am tormented by it, some days more than others. I would give anything for this injury to be healed forever. But just like my ankle, I will always be a little weak. I will always be fighting to stay upright. \n",

    "content": "My assaults started when I was about 10 and brother was 13. It started slow with him touching me while I slept. It gradually increased as the weeks went on and he gained more confidence. He would ejaculate on my body while I pretended to sleep wondering why my brother was doing this. I was too scared to confront him so I layed there scared and let it happen. After about a year of him assaulting me while i slept he got the confidence to do it when I was awake. He woke me up and asked me to give him oral and when I refused he forced it. He then blackmailed me by saying if I didn't agree to do what he said hed tell our parents and friends what i did that night. I went along with it and gave him oral sex every time he asked for months. Me allowing him to do more with no push back caused him to want more since he feared no consequences at this point. One night he came into my room. I expected him to demand oral like most nights but he ended up demanding me to spread my legs for him. I didn't want to but after a couple threats I layed there and spread my legs for him. He took my virginity and started raping me daily for 2 years. The assaults lasted years until I was 13. I regret not putting up more of a fight. Didn't push, didnt hit, didnt yell. Just layed there for years and let him inside of me. Even though it's been over 5 years I haven't told anyone besides a couple close friends. I wonder if it's something I should tell my family or if I should keep it locked away. I see only 2 options and it's to tell my family which could potentially divide my family and ruin relationships or let everyone be happy including my abuser and sit in silence",

    "content": "There were multiple tags I wanted to add, but I figured this one would be most relevant considering this is my first time posting here and I will recount what happened. But more than that, I am\u2026 confused. Uncertain. And need a place to throw my thoughts down so I don\u2019t implode.\n\nI\u2019m 17, and it stopped a few years ago. I\u2019d say when I was around 12/13. \n\nA bit of backstory: My mom and dad split when I was really young (is it even considered \u2018split\u2019 if they were barely dating?). Probably when I was around 2/3. Around when I was 7, my dad met my now step mom. She\u2019s really lovely, much nicer than my own mother. She has two sons, and one is very close in age to me. He\u2019s actually just 9 months older than me. \n\nAlright, now to my story: Naturally, me and the step brother closest to me in age, I\u2019ll call him A going forward, got along. We both had parents that split, and being so close in age it made sense we\u2019d spend time together. I was always a bit of a tomboy, being assigned female at birth, so me and A would do a lot of \u2018boyish\u2019 things together (play video games, fake wrestle, pretend to be spies, etc.) Now, at my dads house (I lived with my mom for the majority, and would go to my dads on the weekends) my makeshift room was in the basement. It wasn\u2019t like a creepy basement. It was decent. Kind of like a second living space (living area, huge bathroom, bedroom). The bedroom was made into the playroom, and there was a futon which became my bed. So the basement was my space. But, it was also A\u2019s space. All of his toys were down there, so we spent many hours playing in the basement. I\u2019d say it all started roughly when I was 8/9. Remember I mentioned we would wrestle? One day, we had been. It\u2026 turned into more than that. A crack formed in my comfortability with him that day. I think that was the most severe event (I say think because I had a shit childhood so a lot of it is blacked out in my head). After that there was the time he pulled my pants down, or the time he laid on top of me in my sleep. Or touches that lingered too long in the pool. But, what I remember most is when we would be upstairs together when our parents were there. He\u2019d always make sure to lay down, legs stretched all the way to my end of the couch. He always covered himself up with a blanket so no one would see him just\u2026 (it sounds so silly to say it) wiggle his toes against my thigh? I know\u2026 but with everything, it felt dirty. It made my skin itch. Luckily I guess he finally grew out of it and it finally stopped.\n\nAnd that\u2019s basically the whole story. My main motivator for writing this is my lingering feelings of doubt. I\u2019m sure many people on this subreddit feel it. Did he actually do that? Was I imagining it? Was it not as deep as I made it out to be? Which, as much as I want to believe when I tell myself this, is a bunch of crap because of course it actually happened. It made me feel violated. It affected me so much. Is there really any other qualification other than how it made me feel?\n\nBut still, I doubt.\n\nI\u2019ve told a few people about this, but only vaguely. Nobody knows who did it. They don\u2019t even know they were in or even close to my family. But I have no friends that I know of that have gone through a similar experience, and therefore have no one to confide in about how I feel.\n\nI have gone through many traumatic things in my so far short life. But\u2026 this always seemed like it never truly affected me that much. Sure, my body would physically inch itself away anytime anybody got too close. Or id flinch if someone accidentally brushed against me when they walked past. Even prolonged contact causes physical pain. But where was the mental stuff? The flashbacks. The nagging voice. The fear. \n\nI think I\u2019ve realized something though. I don\u2019t know exactly why, or what even it is specifically that my brain did. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve just shut out any emotion from those years. And how I know this?\n\nAnytime someone brings it up (namely my therapist and an old psychiatrist) I get defensive. And then those stupid tears come in. And it feels like I might vomit. My therapist, I suppose, has learned that that topic is never to be brought up unless I am the one doing it. Anytime she tried after I told her, I\u2019d shut down and simmer in my tearful rage and fear. \n\nDespite that, I always insisted that wasn\u2019t my biggest issue. Plenty of other things were hindering my day to day life. Besides, it wasn\u2019t even that bad. Definitely not as bad as some other people have had. So there was no reason for it to really affect me\u2026 right?\n\nI guess my point is\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really the case. I like to write poetry, and recently I\u2019ve started dedicating ones to parts of my life. The second I started on this section, I broke. Like I crossed that invisible line I had drawn in my head. Or I unlocked a door I had thought I\u2019d hid the key to. And those bits of uncertainty that I don\u2019t let myself linger on came in full force. \n\nIf I react this way anytime I let myself touch on it, then it has to mean more to me than the lie I\u2019ve fed to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 I know I should finally let my therapist touch on this, but I\u2019m just\u2026 terrified. I obviously haven\u2019t told any of my family. I don\u2019t want to think about what it would do to them. My dad isn\u2019t A\u2019s biggest fan, and I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019d react if he learned about this. Or god forbid everyone think I\u2019m lying. And I\u2019m terrified of what will happen to me. How will it affect my mind? My emotions? If I finally let myself actually work through what those years did to me\u2026 who will come out on the other side of it?\n\nI believe that\u2019s all for now. Apologies for the entire book I wrote. Clearly I don\u2019t talk about this often and I guess I just needed to get it out. I also apologize for any spelling/grammatical errors.

    "content": "Hello, i am 22f and I just need a place to get this off my chest and see what other people think because I\u2019m stuck. Okay this story is going to be confusing but I\u2019m going to do my best to go in chronological order but my memory is muddled. Let\u2019s introduce a couple of key people in this story, my dad (Jeramy), my step mother (Danni), my mom (Nancy), my blood brother who is three years older than me (Lenox) and my step brother (Kyle). So all of this starts in 2012 at this time I was 12 as well Kyle was 11. Kyle started showing some signs of being weird like just glaring at me, texting me to hangout after everyone had gone to bed, etc, but I brushed it off. Then the predatory behavior started, on his way to the game room upstairs (where Dannis kids would always hangout) you\u2019d pass by my bedroom. He would open my door and keep walking down the hall. It had happened multiple times while I had been changing, so I would change in my closet. Well, my bedroom was the only bedroom in the house with a lock on it. My dad told me after I started locking it it that it was not to be locked EVER. So this pattern of behavior continued. Anyway we can jump over this part, he assaulted me in my sleep at 14. He was 13. He made me swear not to tell anyone or he would unalive himself. Blah blah blah, well during the time between the assault and the day I told,  if I felt unsafe at my dads house I would just go to Lenox\u2019s room because I knew Kyle would never be brave enough to do something in front of him. Well Lenox goes off to collage. We drop him off and me and my mom were leaving the dorm and I really just lost it, I started hyperventilating and shaking and crying saying \u201ci can\u2019t go to dads house alone.\u201d Over and over. My mom finally asks me what\u2019s really going on and I tell her I have some screenshots I needed her to read (I had screenshots of Kyle telling me everything he did and everything he wanted to do.) we stopped at Olive Garden and she read them and cried and apologized. Anyyyyyway we go to therapy and my therapist (who is a mandated reporter mind you) sits my dad down and says \u201cif you\u2019re going to stand up as a parent now tis the time, This little girl needs you\u201d and he looked me in my eyes and said \u201cthe best I can do is a couple hours on Wednesdays I need to save my marriage\u201d at fourteen I didn\u2019t really know what that meant, definitely didn\u2019t realize it meant I\u2019d loose my dad forever. She also informed us she would be notifying CPS about the issue. I begged him for MONTHS to see me and my dad was always to busy with Danni\u2019s other kids (she has 3 boys). well jump forward two years of minimal contact with my dad besides running into him and his other family at the grocery store we shared,  and getting a letter from CPS stating I don\u2019t have enough evidence for a case (even though I had a text message confession from him!!!!) my mom asked me if I wanted to move 3hours away and I said yes. So I go off to a new town I move schools the summer before my junior year. I see my dad maybe 3 times during the remainder of high school. The first time I go my dad swears Kyle won\u2019t be there, I tell Nancy I have a bad feeling. She hits me with the \u201cif your dad died tomorrow would you be upset that you didn\u2019t go?\u201d And yeah anyone would? So I go . Everything\u2019s fine until the day before I\u2019m scheduled to leave on the train back home. Kyle SHOWS UP unannounced (he was 15 and didn\u2019t drive so how it was unannounced? I have no clue) and he looks me in the eyes and smiles at me. I use my emergency contact (a friend since kindergarten and her mom) I then call my mom and tell her what happened and she calls my dad who was in the shower during all of this, informs him and long story short my dad and I drive to meet my mom half way IN SILENCE. Anyway I go home and collect myself and don\u2019t see my dad of them again for some time. THEN Lenox graduates from collage WOO smart cookie!! **FUN FACT that\u2019s not so fun: Lenox had no clue what was going on at home because I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell him while he was in collage due to the fear he might come home.and during this time Lenox is always pushing me to be around my dad and pushing my dads agenda** SO I tell Lenox\u2019s long term girlfriend what has happened leading up to all of this, I tell her, she says Lenox needs to hear this so on his graduation trip to Tennessee I told him EVERYTHING. He\u2019s on my side now about how fucked up it is. Okay flash forward some time I go to the beach with my dads side I am told Kyle will be there, I go because I think I will have my own space to retreat to if it gets to be too much. My dad doesn\u2019t tell me I will be SHARING A ROOM WOTH KYLES GIRLFRIEND WHILE IM THERE until I am there in the living room of this beach house my dad rented 8 hours from home without my car (I rode with Lenox and his girlfriend). So that happens okay NOW flash forward to thanksgiving of this past year (2021) I made the decision that I no longer wanted to be around Kyle. I told my dad I will not be attending due to kyles presence but I\u2019d be happy to come another time. He says \u201cI thought we were over this??\u201d And it really cut me deep. And again flash forward to this past weekend, it was my dads birthday/ my youngest step brothers graduation/going to college party. I was invited. I asked if Kyle was going to be there and he was. I had a week to figure out if I wanted to go. I toss and turned with it for the majority of the week. The party was at 5 o\u2019clock on Saturday. I decided on Friday at 6:30pm that I wanted to go. So I roped in my best friend and we drove to my brothers house (5 hours away) and went to the party the next day, we arrive the first person I see is Kyle and he looks straight at me. I go in whatever whatever I\u2019m talking to a girl that related to Danni let\u2019s call her Lexi, she\u2019s dannis cousin. So Lexi and I are catching up blah blah blah and we start talking about Kyle and she brings up the fact (which I had known but forgotten) that he also did the same thing to Lexi. He has also (I think 2020-2021? Somewhere in there) offended another girl (a minor) and got a charge for it. I am at a loss because I just don\u2019t know what to do. I want to cut my dad and all of that bullshit out completely but he helps me pay for my college and living situation, so there\u2019s some strings attached. I need some advice. What do I do now? I don\u2019t understand how my dad can continue to justify this behavior. He\u2019s losing both of his kids because of it. The quote that rings the most true is \u201cas an empathetic person I understood. as his daughter, it hurt.\u201d",

    "content": "To start, I'm angry. I'm so angry. Everything feels so unjust. My life feels so unfair. I feel ruined. I feel like life will always feel that way. I remember when I was in highschool I made a comment that I felt like I was cursed. And to be honest I still kind of feel like that.\n\nWhen I was somewhere between 10 and 12, I was sexually abused by my older brother. He's 6 years older than me. He would come to my room in the middle of the night. It was reoccurring. I don't know exactly how long it lasted. But I know it went on for a long time. I can narrow down the timeline a lot, but still not perfectly. I joined a swim team at some point when I was 12 and I'm pretty sure it had stopped by then. We moved into a new house when I was 10 and I'm pretty sure the abuse occured solely in that house. But I'm still pretty iffy on the timeline. I can't say if it lasted under a year or for several years. After it happened everything was buried pretty deep in my memory. To the point that I doubted it happened at all. When it started resurfacing (when I was 14/15 and he wasn't living with us anymore) I even thought I was the perverted one for thinking it. It took a while for me to come to terms with the fact that it wasn't my imagination. They were memories.\n\nI'd lie awake at night wondering if it'd be the one night I'd guess some peace. Exactly once, I tried to pretend I couldn't hear him, that I was asleep. He came in my room anyway and assaulted me while I was completely unresponsive. While I \"slept\" in a bunk bed with my sister asleep underneath us. I didn't do that again. Because it happened anyway and if it was gonna happen anyway I might as well milk him for all he was worth. \n\nHe'd manipulate me. Using a mix of guilting me (telling me I was a bad sister if I didn't participate) and bribing me (offering whatever loose change he had at that moment). He'd tell me it was because he needed to practice for his girlfriend. \n\nMy parents aren't the most supportive. They believed me right away and never doubted me. But their stance on the situation is that I need to forgive him. Especially my mom. I think I'd rather die.\n\nThis has led to.. so. Many. Arguments. \n\nEspecially with my mom. To be honest I don't talk to my dad about it a lot, and he's not very supportive either. The rare times I've talked to him about it in the past, he's just reminded me how long it's been (I just turned 25) and just said that he (my abuser) is his son. Like I'm not his daughter.\n\nBut my mom is the one I argue with the most about it.\n\nThis has put a lot of strain on our relationship especially recently.\n\nWhen I was a kid, a while after the abuse started (Maybe after it finished, but maybe not) my brother was kind of caught in the act. He was holding one of the neighborhood kids in his lap, and he had a certain.. REACTION to it. My other brother saw and immediately went to my mom about it. A few years ago, she told me about it and told me how she dealt with it. She didn't tell my dad, or at least didn't tell him the whole story. (I've talked to him about it. He knew about him holding a kid in his lap, but didn't know about the reaction he had to it) But they talked to him about it. And told him that if someone caught him like that he could be in a lot of trouble. Basically only emphasizing personal consequences to him and not how he could hurt someone else. And scar them for life. \n\nWhen my mom told me about this she told it like she had handled this perfectly. In my opinion, that was the day she knew she had a predator in the house and she did nothing. How was he supposed to interpret her lecture any other way than that she was telling him to hide it better? Other than that she didn't make any move to separate him from us or the other neighborhood kids. He was very popular with them. And he played with us all the time. Even going as far as participating in whatever petty drama we had with each other. (I remember him siding with some kids that didn't like me. I have a memory of him, on my younger sister's birthday, hugging a neighborhood girl and just chilling in a dunk tank with her. And telling me to leave. Because she didn't like me and didn't want to hang out with me).\n\nWhen I was 16 I first hinted at what my brother did to me to my mom. My dad had gotten a job that paid pretty well, but took him out of the country. So my mom was the one in charge of us. I don't remember what the argument was about. But I remember it involved my OTHER brother. (He's a narcissist. And has always been pretty emotionally abusive to me. Im not on speaking terms with him anymore and I haven't been since I was 18. But he caused a lot of drama in my 8th grade year and into highschool). During the argument she had yelled \"what's wrong with you?\" And I yelled back \"Ask (abuser)\"\n\nA few days later that bit me in the ass. She tricked me into getting in the car with her so I'd be trapped while she interrogated me about it. Then she threatened to take me to the police when I wouldnt tell her about it. (Obviously. Like the best way to handle your traumatized daughter is to traumatize her further????? WTF) Needless to say I reacted pretty bad to it. I ended up jumping out of the moving car and getting my foot stuck under the wheel. I'm not crazy, I waited for her to slow down before I did it. But, yeah, I jumped out of the car. I wasn't hurt worse than a badly scraped knee and a bruised foot. I say, car but it was a jeep, so probably one of the lighter trucks to get stuck under. \n\nEven today, the way she tells it, I was trying to run away. (When I got out from under the wheel. I ran HOME. While she followed me with the car. She's still convinced I was trying to run away from home, and not from HER and her interrogation) I figure she tells it like that so she can justify how she acted.\n\nI ended up telling my parents the whole story not too long after. But only when my dad was there. I wouldn't have said a word if he wasn't.\n\nWhen I told them, they believed me. My dad even cried. I told them when C (my abuser) was due to visit us. Because I was scared and I didn't want to see him. But then they asked if it was still ok if he came. And I lost any nerve I had to stand up for myself and said yes. I said that I was used to seeing him after the abuse I faced. That I could handle it before and I could handle it then.\n\nAnd he did come that year. And every year since. Once even for an extended stay for several months while he was trying to get into the military.\n\nI finally put my foot down about it a few years ago. When my little sister came forward that he abused her too. She told my mom first. And my mom told her about me. So she told me too. That's the point of friction that my relationship with my parents. And especially my mom really started dissolving. After I found out I pulled my parents aside and told them that I wasn't comfortable seeing him anymore. And if they couldn't respect that and support me. Then I'd press charges against him officially if that was the only way I could keep him out of my life and my sister's.\n\nThey didn't react too terribly about it at the time. But a few months later. I found out that he was due to visit again. But not from my parents. I walked in on my other brother (K) talking to my sister about going to pick up C at the airport. I immediately went to my mom. We got in a huge fight. She said a lot of cruel things to me. Like: she asked me if he did anything else to me since then, as if what he already did wasn't enough. And she told me that C was gonna take my place in heaven. (I'm an atheist. I stopped going to church when I was 14. And I refuse to forgive my brother for what he did to me. During the argument my mom was trying to tell me that he wasn't being invited into the house. That wasn't good enough for me. He was in the military at that point and lived in North Carolina, I didn't want him within driving distance of me. And I had only found out because I overheard K trying to talk my sister into coming with him to pick C up at the airport. Because K doesn't know about the abuse. Which, to me, meant that her promises that I wouldn't have to see him meant nothing. Becuase K didn't know what happened and wouldn't understand any restrictions. Not to mention, C was visiting for the 4th of July. And if he was gonna be there for the festivities, then I was gonna be the one excluded from them. And my sister, if she was a stubborn as me.\n\nAfter that fight I left the house and didn't come back till about 2:00 AM.\n\nBefore and during that argument, my mom would always insist that I try to patch things up with C. That he would \"appreciate\" a call from me. So while I was gone. I called him. And told him not to come. And if I ever saw him again I'd press charges against him.\n\nNeedless to say, my mom hasnt pressured me to talk to him since.\n\nI'm a little suspicious he came anyway. Because a few days after the argument my parents came to me to tell me they were going to visit my other brother at his apartment. They don't usually do that. It's out of character and i don't have a say or an opinion on where they go or why. They don't tell me where they're going. I dont question it. But out of the blue they need to make sure I know? It was and is suspicious. Im 95% sure they were visiting C. But I was scared to follow through on my threat to press charges. So I didn't follow that bread crumb. I didn't want to know. \n\nWhich, I guess is enough backstory to describe everything that's been happening recently with my mom. I got a new job, which was stressful. And Id been working more hours than was really healthy. I picked up a couple of bad coping habits. My mom found out about one. It took me a while after I turned 21 before I drank any alcohol at all. Cause ever since I was in highschool, I thought if I started drinking, it'd be a problem for me. Escapism is just my cup of tea. But after I started my job. I started drinking a little bit. Occasionally I could go overboard and make myself sick. And to be honest when I had that job, I was definitely going overboard with it. I'd get off work and stay up as late as I could drink) but my mom only found out cause she went in my room and found some bottles. (It's pretty impossible to throw away bottles. She's admitted to looking through my trash before. She's never had respect for my privacy. Most of the people in my family havent. When I was in highschool K even put a camera up to my bedroom window so he could record me without my knowledge. I was on the 2nd goddamn floor. He taped the camera to a broomstick. And when I was 13 my mom once hid under my bed so she could spy on me. She stayed there for a solid 10-15 minutes before she let me know she was there. It makes me paranoid. So over time, the bottles added up. Because I wouldn't throw them away. Which just got more stressful for me.) I have a lock on that bedroom door with a key, so ever since she went in my room I started locking the door whenever I leave the house. I do it religiously. I'm an adult. And there's a certain amount of privacy an adult should get. Because there are certain parts of an adult's life that should be separate from their parents. The day she went in there I had some very adult things left in the open. And it's mortifying knowing she most likely saw them. So I keep it locked when I'm not home to make sure she can't come and go whenever she was wants. And to make sure she can't go through my things.\n\nI recently quit my job. It got to be too much. My coworkers were toxic. And a friend I made there quit with me for the same reason. And to be honest I couldn't stand the thought of working there without her, so I quit with her. She told me she felt like the job was negatively effecting my mental health. Even despite everything. My manager told me if I ever wanted my job back I could get it back. And Ive recently heard that he's planning on cleaning house there and hiring a whole new staff. So if I wanted it back by then... \n\nBut ever since my mom found out about the drinking, she's decided to make fixing my lack of faith and my feelings about my brother her personal mission. Which isn't abnormal for her. But I guess the situation... reinvigorated it? We've been arguing so much more than we ever have. And it got even worse when she decided to put me in a group chat with C and text me some Bible verses about forgiveness. I have him blocked on my phone. So if he replied to the group chat, I didn't see it. But the lack of respect for my boundaries? The shear audacity to put a victim of sexual violence ina group chat with her abuser? I feel like something in me just snapped, I saw red. And I basically flayed her alive and listed out all my worst feelings and memories of her. I told her she prioritized her sons. She denied it. I told her it didn't matter if she believed me or not, and that it wasn't any of my business. I blamed her for not taking action when she was clued in when we were kids. When he had that girl on his lap. She gaslit me by misrepresenting the situation and telling me that she couldn't predict what he did to us just because he held a girl in his lap. Even though he didn't just hold a girl in his lap, he got a boner from holding a six 6-7 year old in his lap.\n\nNow my relationship with her is the worst it's ever been. We barely talk. I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm the devil. I'm angrier at her than I've ever been. And angriest of all at my brother. Every once in a while I think about pressing charges against him. But Im thinking about it more and more recently. I want to see him in prison. Or at the very least, I want him labelled as a sex offender. \n\nI brought it up exactly once with my mom. That made it pretty clear just how delusional she is. She said he would probably appreciate me pressing charges against him. It's like she thinks he's some kind of martyr of his own choices. She has no respect for my boundaries with him. She'll talk to him on speaker phone in shared spaces in the house. She'll talk to him ABOUT ME when she has a problem with me.\n\nIt feels unfair. It feels unjust. He just got off scot free and my sister and I get to suffer for it. I get told I'm gonna burn in hell because I refuse to forgive him, while he's still somehow her favorite child. And what about whoever else he decides to put his filthy hands on? Now or in the future? I'm terrified about what'll happen if he ever gets married. If he ever gets kids. I feel like I'm being tortured by the fact that I never came forward about it.\n\nShould I press charges?",

    "content": "Mods if this is inappropriate for this sub please redirect me, I feel like I'm losing my mind and I just need some solid advice on this situation. \n\nFor the past 6 years I have been friends with a boy who, for the sake of confidentiality we'll call him Dick. Our friendship had grown to a point where we considered one another family and spent every holiday together. Dick didn't have a father and I didn't have a mother growing up, so we bonded throughout the years. There was a period in my life when I went to live up island (I was 10 he was 14) so we lost contact. After I had returned home at 16 we became re acquainted through our parents and 6 months later  tried to find some kind of spark, but came to the mutual agreement that we just didn't feel anything more than a love felt between friends\n\nDick had the misfortune of falling into relationships with girls he wanted to fix, a lot of these relationships ended with him being cheated on. As a result, I believe he began to slowly lose respect for women. He would often make crude jokes and rip on girls he saw in public, my father wasn't a very good role model with this either. \n\nThe first problem I ever had with Dick occurred after he had been drinking, he was staying with me at my apartment and I was in be when he came home. He tried crawling into bed with me and in my own stupidity, I let him, being too tired to protest. I woke up in the middle of the night to him literally humping my leg. This was an immediate red flag, but I thought I would give him the benefit of the doubt and made damn sure he slept on the couch. After this It seemed like every time he drank he would practically beg to cuddle--I'm not sure if this was because he was lonely, or because he thought drinking would be a good excuse? But I have always been up front and honest about where our relationship stood.\n\nOn December 31st at approximately 10pm I showed up at an unknown house, the address had been sent to me from Dick, but no other details aside from 'fireworks'. We were going to celebrate New Years together along with a few mutual friends of ours.\n\nWhen I arrived Dick had already been drinking, there were two older adults [m/35], [f/40] I was unfamiliar with and a bunch of teenagers [m/m/f/f/16] whom had all been drinking. Dick's friend Westman was also there, but none of the people I knew. \n\nI had two glasses of wine and Dick a few more drinks, everybody went outside several minutes before Midnight to set up fireworks and at approximately 1:30 everyone had gone to bed. I can remember Wes carrying me to the couch where I fell asleep.  \n\nAt approximately 3:30-4AM I woke up to Dick on top of me, my shirt had been unbuttoned and so was the first button on the jeans I was wearing. Dick had his hands down my pants and was sexually assaulting me. At first I had no idea it was him, but upon realizing it was, my reaction was a mix of rage and disgust. I managed to shove him off of me, which he didn't resist and ran to the kitchen to grab a knife. I never could have imagined him actually hurting me, but given the situation, at that time anything was possible and I wasn't taking any chances. He tried to explain to me that it was a misunderstanding but I was so horrified that I immediately ran for the door and headed for my car. I even left my boots behind. When I got to my car I unlocked the door and locked it once I was inside. Dick followed me and wouldn't get out of the way. When I tried backing up I wound up running into something (a rock?) which really did some damage to the rear bumper of my car. I sped off to Crofton in hysterics where my friend Tammy lived, she's the only known witness to the aftermath of the event. I spent the night there and have since not made any attempt to press charges.\n\nDick did not rape me, but at this point I'm not sure if he would have had I not woken up in time. I consider myself to be a very light sleeper, but now I'm unsure. Has this happened before?\n\nThe reason why this is still haunting me is because before this incident Dick and I started volunteering with the same organization, I'm forced to see him at every meeting and he won't even so much as apologize to me. That's all I want! I just want and need for him to acknowledge that for once in his life hes done something wrong. I just recently found out that this isn't the first time he's done this to girls--but definitely not at this level. \n\nI've messaged my supervisor and will be talking to her about the incident this Thursday. What else should I do? I don't want to lose myself in this resentment, but i can't just simply let it go either.\n\nTL;DR - caught childhood friend molesting me in my sleep, we volunteer together, not sure what action to take under reasonable limits. \n",

    "content": "Apologies for the long story in advance. Ok so there are 3 men in my life that did things to me when I was young that made me super uncomfortable at the time but only as I got older did I question if those things were sexual assault. \n\nThe first is my grandfather. When I was young (5-12 ish) and would visit my grandparents, I always sat with my grandfather and he would give me back scratches. He always ended up reaching around the front and rubbing up and down on my chest (under my shirt). I would try to stop this by holding my arms tight to my sides so he couldn\u2019t get through but he would push through them. \n\nThe second is my older brother. Between the ages of 10-16 I would catch him putting his head under the blankets I was under while sitting on the couch. I had a habit of falling asleep there while watching something and would wake up to feeling something like a hand trying to move my shorts aside but if I twitched at all I saw him whip his head out and act like nothing happened. Once, I was taking a nap in my room and he came in to wake me up and I felt him out his hand on my butt and then when I whipped around I said \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d he just said it was time to get up. \n\nThe third is a family friend that\u2019s my age and we\u2019ve grown up together. Our families are really close and we\u2019re basically family. We were 14 and he was sleeping over and I once again had fallen asleep while watching a movie on the couch. I woke up to feeling something on my leg. I thought it was just a tickle from the blanket so I didn\u2019t move. Then I felt a hand on my butt and I opened my eyes to see him crouching on the floor next to me. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just rolled over so he could touch me there. My movement startled him and he back up till he thought I was sound asleep again. But then he got close and started touching my chest. I pretended to twitch in my sleep and he left and I got up and ran to my room. I felt so sick cause cause I didn\u2019t know why he did that. I\u2019ve honestly thought about this every day since that night and it sometimes keeps me awake at night. \n\nI don\u2019t know if these instances count and I know I should feel lucky that nothing went farther than any of these and that much worse has happened to others. But I\u2019m 21 now and it\u2019s been almost 2 years since I\u2019ve started questioning these things from my past and I think about them everyday. I feel like I can\u2019t trust any man in my life if these men so close to me could do this. Any time I see any of the three of them it\u2019s the only thing going through my head.",

    "content": "My(18 F) step-dad, (41M) has been touching me in my sleep for over a year now. My dad has never really been in my life. Our relationship has been basically non-existent, only pops up when I do well in life. I was born and raised in my grandparents house, with my mom, until maybe 6 when my mom met my step-dad. She had me young, 20. My step-dad also has a daughter who was my age. My step-dad, let's call him M. M and I didn't have the best relationship when I was younger. He was really mean and used to yell at me a lot. M and my mom would fight a lot in their early twenties, some even physical, and I would be woken up in the middle of my sleep to them almost killing each other. My grandmother was my safe space, she liked to gossip, bad-mouth people, but she was my grandmother. She lived like 2 minutes away from us, so anything that occurred at home, I would call her.\n\nAnyways, when I was around 13, I called my father for something and he yelled at me on the phone. I've been yelled at many times in my life. Some way worse than that, but something about his audacity really hurt me. I cried. A lot. From that moment on, me and M's relationship got a bit better. I guess he felt bad for me and tried to be the father figure instead of my dad. He would make jokes with me, play fight a few times. \n\nWhen quarantine started, I realized that when we would playfight, he would do weird things. At first, he would slap me on my butt. Please keep in mind that I never had a father figure, atleast not one that I was super close to, so I wasn't used to the father-daughter dynamics, hence I brushed it off as something normal, though I didn't like it.\n\nThen, he started to pull my pants a bit and then spank me. I knew something was wrong there. I asked two friends about it, if it were normal and they immediately told me no. Questioned me about it and I got scared. When they asked later on, I lied and told them he stopped. He never showed any signs of lust or anything inappropriate otherwise so I deluded myself into thinking it was probably just him trying to bond with me. After a while it stopped I think.\n\nThen came the inappropriate talks. All of it was so subtle and he would pass it off as advice, like the grooming of my private parts and how to do it and how my body looked etc.\n\nBy the time I was seventeen, we had a strong relationship I guess. I was desperate for a father-daughter one. My grandmother was sick, close to dying. He would leave the house at 5 am, the time that I wake up for school, so most, if not every morning, he would come and tell me goodbye and probably leave instructions for me to do, however I'm a heavy sleeper and I'm always in a haze whenever he wakes me up that I barely ever remember if he talks to me. We would laugh it off and he would always sound amazed at how much of a heavy sleeper I am.\n\nOne day in August I think, 2023, I was asleep and I felt my sheet being slowly pulled away. I was hazy and it was a year ago, so I don\u2019t know if he touched my underwear this time. By the time I was getting up, I heard movement, then I saw his hand hit the light switch to turn it off and I heard him run off. Long story short, it happened multiple times, went on to late or middle September I think. I would feel pressure against my vagina, through my underwear, his fingers I think. I tried locking my door, but my mom used to get angry at me for locking it at night. Every time I would begin to wake up, he would immediately run off. One time I think I shut up, stared at him in the eyes and closed back my eyes because I was hazy and scared. He never got to touching my actual private part. \n\nOctober 2023, I think, was when I finally broke. I had a hatred building up for him. I was lashing out at my little brother and I didn't want to spend time with anyone. There was something he yelled at me for and I think I answered with some bad attitude. My mother scolded me about it and that I should have respect for him. I think I yelled, \"how can I have respect for him if he touches me\" or something like that. She demanded I told her what happened and I did. I left, and she called him and asked him about it. That mf denied. Said he didn't know what I was talking about. But like a true manipulator, he told me that if I believed that that's what he did then I can call the police and we would be arrested. I was 17 at the time so of course it would have been a crime. Thing is, though, my school work was the most important for me. I had to get my education and graduate, it was only escape. If I told the police, things would be way more complicated. Me, my brother (his son) and my mom were living in his house. If I reported it, I would miss school and be even more distracted and I was scared that I would do terribly in my exams and I won't have a way out. I also felt like I would be ruining my brother's life and he'd be fatherless like me and I feel like my mom never believed me and she would hate me. So I chose not to report it.\nDo you know what they did? My mom and M tried to convince me that it was spirits. Spirits that were touching me. My own mother...\nDo you know her reason? I never actually saw him touching me, just his hand. And when I looked at him that one time, he wasn't touching me. Which was true, I woke up when the sheet was moving. I decided from then I had to play along because I still had a year of school left. My grandmother died the December.\n\nThis stuff isn't like the movies. Or atleast what I thought it was going to be like. I didn't recoil from everyone's touch, I didn't get nightmares. I even questioned if I was truly assaulted. Worst of all, I began to forget. I started looking at him the way I did when I considered him my father. He never touched me for a year. A year things were normal and I forgot. Then it happen again. October 2024. I didn't know what to do. I came home acting weird and like the hypocrite he is, acted concerned when my mother pointed out that something was off. It didn't happen for more than a week again I think and I started to second guess myself until it happened some more times. It affected me so much but I had to hide it. What other choice did I have? I was 18 now and no one would believe me because I didn't say anything the first time and I'm still dependant on him. I started getting suicidal thoughts. I think I actually planned it, but I got cold feet. Any time he would yell at me or get me angry, it was at the tip of my tongue, to tell him about it, or the impulse to do something bad to myself or him. I think it stopped after late November. I'm ashamed to say I sometimes forget about it. I guess it's my way of trying to act like everything is normal. But the minute he gets me angry it's the first thing I remember and those feelings come back. I'm scared that he might do it again and I'll say something, or worse, do something to him or myself.\n\nPlease advise me on what to do. The only people that know are my mom, M and my ex-best friend. I can't tell anyone but it eats me alive. \n\nI also feel like it could be worse, you know? I mean I haven't been r@ped. I also feel guilty because aside from that, my mother has sacrificed so much for me and I may not be rich, but I still have food, a shelter and clothes to wear and there are a lot of things I don't have to be worried about. I feel like if I speak out, I'll be labeled as the ungrateful daughter because nothing really happened to me.\n\n",

You can trust people until you don't.\n\nMa: well you should have fought him when he started \n\nMe: I was....literally asleep? Are you like, in the dictionary under victim-blaming?\n\nMa:. I'm not victim blaming because you're not a victim. At my age, I'd love if that happened to me! Haha!\n\nMe: you know, at any point, you could have just said that this guy made the wrong choice. At any point, you could have blamed this guy you have no vested interest in, rather than your own daughter. This is why we need pro-choice. Because I need to have a choice to counteract the fucking stupid ones other people make that they'll never be accountable for. \n\nIn the past 4 years, I have been fondled on my sleep on THREE separate occasions. This is the third.\n\nPrior to that, my boyfriend had sex with me without my consent while I was asleep (very drunk). I didn't know until 2 days later, and it did result in pregnancy.\n\nPrior to that, I was having a party at my own house. The party was ending and I asked my brother to take his friend home and went to bed with my best friend who was staying the night. I woke up to him fondling both of us. My brother never took him home because his friend said he'd call an Uber and my brother didn't want to wait. This, according to him, was also our fault because we should have had someone there to protect us????? (We thought he was gone??)\n\nTHIS IS WHY Roe V Wade is important. These are the men, and women, that constantly let me down. I was molested as a child and it just NEVER FUCKING STOPPED. I can't depend on anyone in my life. I need the choices to be MINE. Not the governor's, not the will of the church, but MINE. Give me my power back. Give me my autonomy back. Give me my security back. Give me my body back.",

    "content": "\n**Trigger Warning:** discussion of sexual assault and self harm ahead.\n\n**Warning:** Wall of Text Ahead (I will provide TLDR at the end of the post)\n\nSo, I grew up in a shitty southern town full of a lot of sketchy people and had oblivious parents who tried to do their best to keep me safe but ultimately never did a great job. \n\nI had a lot of crazy/terrible things happen to me and my reaction always has been to put it behind me as much as I can. Forgetting as much as possible.\n\nWhen I turned 18 I met a guy and moved to another state to live with him. That went surprisingly well and we are married with two kids. After the birth of my second daughter, I started having serious problems with depression and uncontrollable mood swings. I had bipolar disorder to begin with. \n\nI start taking medication. It helps some but ultimately doesn't. I find myself doing drugs. Mostly things like weed and ambien. It distracts me from all the uncomfortable thoughts that come creeping in my mind.\n\nA few weeks ago, I felt suicidal. I went to my PCP and one thing lead to another, I ended up involuntarily committed to the hospital. I spent 4 days in a holding room waiting to get a bed at one of the area psych wards. I absolutely can't deal with being in hospitals.I had a panic attack at around day 2 and it resulted in six cops beating the hell out of me and putting me in restraints before injecting me with drugs against my will. I understand that this is all per protocol and \"for the safety of the patient and staff\", but I left that encounter with a head injury and a body black and blue with bruises. \n\nI don't like hospitals, psychiatric ones in specific, because I was sexually assaulted by the admitting doctor at one when I was involuntarily to a state psychiatric hospital in my home state.. It was late at night, they were short staffed, so the nurse who probably would have stayed in the room had to go attend to something else. I was told to disrobe completely and put on a paper gown, then to lay on the exam table. \n\nThe doctor was a middle aged white man with salt and pepper hair and I remember he had the same name as my mother's maiden name. I sat up when he walked into the room and mentioned his name and he told me to lay back and not say anything else. I did. Without warning he ripped the gown off of me and pulled out a voice recorder and started a dry and boring diatribe on my physical characteristics. As he did this he ran his hand across my boddy, stopping to fondle my breast, ass, and he stopped to finger me, ungloved, under the guise of needing to check the status of my virginity. I had written down in my new patient paperwork that I was one because that is how I felt. He made a remark in his recording that I had lied. I had been sexually abused by a neighbor for several years as a child. I didn't think that counted.\n\nI don't really remember a lot about how I got from there to the shower room. Once again, I was naked, a group of nurses and medical technicians were standing around me, trying to force me to shower while they all watched. I crouched in a corner and cried and then tried to escape. I was ultimately caught, dragged back, and thrown into the shower. There I was instructed on how to wash my hair and my genitals and ass. I felt disgusting and inhuman. The didn't believe in medicating patients, but if you got too out of control, they had no problem with stripping you of your clothes and locking you in a padded room for a few hours. \n\nThis most recent hospitalization have opened a lot of old wounds. I have been having nightmares about the police attacking me. I feel like it shouldn't feel like such a big deal, but it does. \n\nI was molested by a neighbor between ages 7 and 13. I was assaulted by the doctor at 14. I was sexually assaulted by my brother's girlfriend in my sleep after I had been drinking when I was 15. I was drugged and raped by a guy who I thought was my friend at 15. When I was 13, a man who lived near me found out my address and would threaten me until I would masturbate for him on webcam and watch him do the same. He was fat and disgusting and I never admitted it before.\n\nThen there is the other random violence. I was beaten unconscious at age 12 because people thought I was a lesbian. I was spat on and thrown down flights of stares. I had death threats made to me regularly. This all seemed to happen at 12 because that is the time I decided to stop being so feminine and hope I wouldn't attract so many problems from creepy older men. I shaved my head and wore boys clothes. It lessened one problem but only created a new one. \n\nI found the scene of a murder-suicide when I was 10. Right outside of my mom's business. Man and his sister, shotguns to the head in their car. I watched a classmate get shot to death. I had the neighbor who molested me try to shoot me before while on a meth fueled rage. I have been through a drive-by shooting.\n\nThrough all of this I have had horrible problems with self mutilation (usually cutting) and hair pulling. Also banging my head into/punching walls. \n\nThis beating by the police is the fucking icing on the cake.When I would try to tell my parents about these things, they usually came back to blame me for what went wrong. \n\nI have nightmares every night again. I can barely sleep without a lot of medication and drugs. During my recent stay in the hospital, a psychiatrist mentioned something about me having complex PTSD? i didn't really think to ask her at the time, but it does seem to fit what I go through and my history.\n\nNow, after seeing my case file, the therapist I had scheduled to see after my release from the hospital wants nothing to do with my because my case is too complicated. \n\nHas anyone else had this diagnosis or gone through similar problems? Any idea on how to find a good therapist who is willing to take on more \"complicated\" cases. \n\n**TLDR:** I have a long history of sexual abuse and physical violence. I was re-hospitalized to treat my mental illness surrounding it, however hospitals trigger a PTSD response for me and ultimately make me feel worse/less safe. I am stuck on bad meds and without a counselor for the time being. Anyone else go through similar?\n\n",

    "content": "I \\[21\\] wrote this when I was 18 or 19 and remembered it today. I wrote it for reddit when I was hurting and never posted it. It's hard for me to read now. It's very long, so please bear with me struggling to piece together my thoughts:\n\n \n\nA lot of this is skewed. I spent many years thinking it over and doubting myself because of how little I found/remember, and because of how young I was and how different I would have processed something like that now.\n\nMy relationship with my dad had always been rocky before the incident. I didn\u2019t meet him until I was 5 and I ended up disliking him partially because of he felt the need to discipline me strictly, fearing I wouldn\u2019t listen to him because he was absent for the first few years of my life. There was also distance between us because I noticed over time that he seemed to preferred my brother, who was male (boys are favored in his culture) and who he actually got to see grow up from birth. In this regard, I always felt more like he treated me like an adopted child, like I was more my mother\u2019s child than his.\n\nOne night, when I was 12, I was sitting on the floor with my brother in a room with my mom folding laundry. He was playing angry birds on my dad\u2019s phone and when he was done, he just gave me and left the room. Because my dad always had a password lock on it and he seemed reluctant to open it for any of us, I went through his phone out of curiosity, not expecting anything. I went into the videos and I found what looked like a small blurry thumbnail of my room, with a view coming from my desk. There was a blurry figure in the center, seemingly naked. I nervously clicked it. The video itself was all black but I turned up the volume slightly and I could hear the sounds of a girl moaning. I had started masturbating really early on in my life, and by 12, I was doing it semi-frequently. I felt my eyes go wide and I stared at my mom, oblivious to me sitting in the corner being traumatized, slowly realizing what was happening. I dropped the phone somewhere, shaking, and walked to my room where my dad was with my brother. He said something to me and I stared at him blankly, feeling numb. \n\nI cried a lot after that. I was scared and hurt he betrayed me and violated my privacy, and in assuming he was sexually attracted to me (since it wasn\u2019t just regular spying, because he kept only that video), I felt like complete shit. I was afraid of him and I was constantly paranoid I was being watched for the next few months. I used to cry all the time, and I became very depressed, hurting myself, until summer break ended and I went back to school and I was around my friends again. I didn\u2019t know to act around him, since we lived together, and I wasn\u2019t even sure if I was right because I didn\u2019t investigate more when I found the video ( and I remember so little about it now).\n\nBefore that incident, I used to knock the webcam off the desktop (I think?), just because I was slightly paranoid about a camera being in my room. It was baseless, but I did it anyway. After seeing the video, I assume it was black because I was consistently removing the webcam. Every day after that, I would keep knocking the webcam off the desktop, thinking he was still watching me. One day, he came into my room and set it back up, telling me to stop knocking it down. I ended up pouring soda into it a few days later and breaking it. \n\nOver the next few years, I had a lot of paranoid experiences where I thought I was being spied on by my father. I don\u2019t know if any of them were real, as most of them were really minute things like me thinking I heard a voice outside my bedroom muttering in the middle of the night or certain ways he would act around me. I can\u2019t remember lots of them. At this point, I can\u2019t tell if any of them were actually what I thought because of how paranoid and young I was. There were times I thought my mother found out and the subsequent things that happened like him smashing his computer were because they were fighting over me, but it was actually something else entirely.  \n\nA few years ago, when I was maybe 15 or 16, my dad was still working his day job and he would leave while I was still asleep. One morning, I woke up to the sound of him opening the door. I tried to fall back asleep until I heard him walk into my room. I stilled and pretended I was asleep, nervous. He shuffled around my desk some and just left. I figured he needed a pen or something and went back to sleep. The same thing happened the next time I woke up to the door, a morning soon after, and I was getting more paranoid. That time, he walked in, and I heard complete silence for 20-30 seconds. Then he walked out. I felt so creeped, assuming he had just been staring at me. Another morning soon after that, I heard him walk in again. At that point, I\u2019d been waking up from anxiety, not knowing why he was walking into my room. He shuffled around my desk once more and I heard silence for 10 seconds. Then, I felt a stick poke my clit. My eyes shot open and I stared down at him between my legs, holding a pen. He said \u201cOh, haha, you\u2019re awake\u201d, providing no explanation for what he was doing. I stared at him and he put the pen back and walked out like nothing happened. He came back into my room before he left, saying goodbye to me affectionately. He tried to coax me into saying something to him, but I just stared blankly at him, still in shock, saying nothing. He sighed and left. I still operate under the assumption that he was trying to diddle me in my sleep (I don\u2019t know what else it could be, really). \n\nI remember some time after that, I went on the communal laptop we all used, and went into the history. I saw lists and lists of searches for daughter/ father and daughter rape porn. Disturbed, I showed my mother and left it at that, just because I felt the need to show it to someone and because I had hoped my mother had already found out about it (like a self-centered teen, I assumed their fights were somehow about me). \n\nWhen I was younger, and even as I was getting too old and uncomfortable with him doing it, he would do things like slap my butt or pinch my nipples to freak me out. He used to stick his hand and head in the shower and start to wave his arms at me or do something silly to make me squeal. It was funny and normal when I was younger, but as I got older, I couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly violated by it. Of course, this, and many other things I accumulated on my list of evidence, could just be that he didn\u2019t realize I had grown out of it/ that it was no longer appropriate without me telling him.\n\nThere are little things, like how he got mad when I started draping the towels around so he wouldn\u2019t see me through the warped glass shower door when he came in the middle of my shower almost every day to piss. Or how he once got busted into my room, playing with my brother, when he knew I went to change my clothes with my brother, and dismissing it while I freaked out and told him to leave. LIttle things like that that I can\u2019t tell if they were just his lack of boundaries/understand of boundaries for what\u2019s appropriate (that I never corrected him on) or if they were opportunities to see me naked. \n\nI was always so paranoid and I assumed so much, it\u2019s like there\u2019s too much floating around my head and I can\u2019t make sense of it.\n\nI still hate how I reacted that day, or any day he did something questionable. I was spineless and I was afraid of him, so I never said anything. I still am. I don\u2019t even know what to say. All these years and I still haven\u2019t confronted him. He and my mother got divorced, so I was hugely relieved when he stopped living with us a year and a half ago. Aside from this, he was generally a bad father to me, always distant, the inconsistent and excessive beatings as punishment, and him preferring my brother, while my mom acted as a single mom for me and my brother (in terms of parenting and emotional support/affection). He treated my mother with no respect, as has become more apparent to me now. I was such an angry little child, and even though I lashed out privately, I wonder if it was because of him.\n\nThe problem is, I\u2019ve spent the all 7 years wondering if I got it all wrong. I made a very daring assumption, and while there is a lot of evidence, I can\u2019t be sure. There are so many inconsistencies I found with my own evidence. \n\nBased on the thumbnail though, it came from an angle from my desk around where the webcam was on an old computer. I never bothered to look if the webcam had an on indicator light after, or if the computer itself was on for it to work and I can\u2019t remember if it was old enough to make noises while it was on and if I would have noticed. I can\u2019t remember if I was knocking the webcam off before the incident or if I made a habit of it after and forgot that it was something I adopted afterwards. If I knocked it off, wouldn\u2019t it not be all black, but still show some of my desk if the light was on? Maybe he recorded me at night when everything was off.\n\nI just stopped listening after about 20 seconds and shut off the phone. If there was a thumbnail, I could have skipped forward to see the actual video part, but I didn\u2019t. That would save me a lot of my doubts now. I can\u2019t remember exactly what the thumbnail looked like, but it\u2019s possible I got it wrong if it was small and I was panicking, right? I never skipped forward to see if any footage the thumbnail came from was there. \n\nI think that\u2019s the problem with a  lot of this. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s a product of my paranoid mind accumulating false evidence over time and what\u2019s real. After discussing it with a friend in a long conversation, a lot of memories came back to me that made me conclude I was right in my assumptions, but I can\u2019t remember everything we talked about now. Maybe I blocked out the memories? A lot of things individually could be seen as non-compelling, but with the first incident, I don\u2019t know what I misunderstood/what is skewed in my memory because of assumptions I was already making about him from the first incident.\n\nI didn\u2019t do enough to be sure but I\u2019m trying not to beat myself up over what my 12 year old self didn\u2019t do in a moment of shock.",

    "content": "TW: Child Sexual Abuse/ Molestation\n\nI'm not really sure how to start, continue or even end this post and to be completely honest i'm not the best writer which makes the anxiety that much more real, however I want to finally speak out in a place that is both welcoming and compassionate. I would like to apologies for my throwaway account, I do not have the confidence or reassurance to post this without hiding behind yet another mask.\n\nFrom the age of 8 until the age of 17 I was sexually assaulted/abused/molested by my stepdad without my family knowing and to this day they still have no idea, however I want to change that and need reassurance that my decision will not worsen my relationship with my family.From as early as I can remember my stepdad; no, my abuser always spoke about how my family never treated me properly, that I deserved more attention and love then I had been getting. At first I didn't truly know what he meant because I felt loved, I felt happy, I felt like my family really knew me but I was a child.. what did I really know or at least that is what I thought. After always hearing this little bird on my shoulder telling me my family never treated me properly, I started to believe the words that I was hearing and that's when he had won. I started feeling like I was an outcast in my family and that my abuser was the only family member who really cared about me and because of this we became close, at first \u201cclose\u201d just meat a little more attention here, a treat of ice cream there or even playing with my hair while we had family time watching TV in the living room. Sadly over time \u201cclose\u201d started to become sexual.\n\nWhen I was around 8 the first attempt of molestation occurred, I don't remember why or how but I remember it being in my moms bed during the day time. I was lying on my stomach and he was tickling my back, like my mom used to do, but slowly he started to move closer and closer to my bum. I remember getting this strange sensation in my lower back, an uncomfortable one, when he would go lower I would squirm and try to ask him to stop or to tickle higher. At first this worked and I thought nothing of it, he just told me it was a \u201cticklish spot\u201d and to \u201cshhhh\u201d so I trusted him and listened, after all I thought he was the one that cared. This continued for a long time until he finally molested me for the first time in my mom's bed using this same method, shushing me and moving further down, telling my that my body liked what was happening even if I didn't understand it because my body was becoming aroused.\n\nFor almost 9 years I was molested on a regular bases and my family had no idea. He would come into my bedroom at night to tickle my back while I slept and would wake me to his hands in my pants. He would lay me on my back in the kitchen and \u201cgo down\u201d on me while by brother was in his room on his xbox. He would pay me money to touch him with my hands and make him cum all the while begging for me to \u201cgive him kisses\u201d on his penis. He would ask me to take my pants and underwear off and bend over for him while he touched himself, he would place me on top of him and have me grind on his member. It went on and on and on.\n\nHonestly ladies the more I think about it the more I question if there ever was a moment of penetration because I can't remember, it happened so frequently(the abuse) and usually while I was tired or sleeping that I don't know anymore. I'd like to think it didn't happen just like I know I never once went down on him, to know I had the strength to say no to at least some of the abuse makes me feel stronger.\n\nThe years of sexual abuse and \u201cgrooming\u201d(not sure if this is the right term) my abuser did to me caused me to feel like an outcast so I became one to my family, as I got older I spent more time away from home with friends to get away from the abuse and feel normal. My family (mom, brother and sister) felt like I didn't appreciate them or that I felt as though I was better than them in some way. I could never work up the courage to tell them what I was going through, that the reasons I spent Christmas, holidays, birthdays, weekends, any event I could with friends wasn't because I didn't love my family but because I was being sexually assaulted right under their noses. I became ashamed of myself and what was going on so I separated myself from them so they could be happy, so that the abuse I was going through wouldn't effect them.\n\nI don\u2019t resent my family, in fact I love them with all my heart and know they would have stopped this abuse had they known. I would give my family anything if it meant seeing them smile or happy but I think this empathy was my downfall and still is a huge issue revolving around this topic. Its why i'm posting here tonight. I want to finally speak out to my family about the abuse, I want to pour my heart out to them and explain why I was the way I was. That the reason I kept myself away wasn't because I didn\u2019t love them but because I wanted to protect them from the horror I was going through, because I was and still am worried they would blame themselves.\n\nMy mother worked two jobs with grueling hours to provide for us kids because my father never paid child support. She would blame herself for not being home enough to notice.My sister was always out with friends because she was older. She would blame herself for not being home enough to notice.My poor brother, he was in the next room on his xbox so engrossed in his games that even with all the doors open he never knew. He would blame himself for not noticing.\n\nI never told my family and still want to hide my abuser because I don\u2019t want to break my family's heart, however at 26 I want to finally HAVE my family and for them to finally have me. Life is much to short to allow my abuser to keep my family from me when all I want to do is cry in their arms and tell them how much I truly missed them all these years.\n\nFriends, ladies, gentlemen, readers, other survivors I want to thank you for taking the time to read and digest what I have written. I am working on getting a therapist to help me with the process of reporting my abuser and then speaking with my family. This post helped me in ways I didn\u2019t expect and im not quite sure how to end things here other then with this thank you. I hope the next post you see from me is from a happy young woman whose family finally has the real her.",

I stayed still but turned away completely from him as the last thing I needed was him touching my boobs or my vagina, (those are the things that I personally consider most privet and can\u2019t imagine what I would do if those parts were touched and it would make the situation much worse) I put my arms up in a tight cross barrier and laid straight so he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch my front half.\n\nHe stopped for little bit because I moved but carried on as I stayed still maybe because he thought I just moved in my sleep (I did try my best to pretend like I was sleep moving because maybe then he could realise I am sleeping and maybe stop or maybe it was just him moving in his sleep and he would stop and realise what he\u2019s doing idk it just seemed like the best thing to do at the time, I don\u2019t fully remember or know what my thought process was and what I was trying to achieve by playing asleep) I was hoping that would be it and me readjusting \u2018sleepily\u2019 would make it stop but no, it didn\u2019t.\n\nAs my whole body was facing away from him now, he moved closer and now he was also laying on his left side, he continued to stroke my side with the occasional slightly gentle thigh/bum squeeze and touching my hair, I\u2019m not sure if it was to move it or touch it or smell it.\n\nI was wide awake at this point and still thinking of what to do as I have never been in this situation before and certainly didn\u2019t expect to be in one that night with one of my closest friends ( we have know each other for around 8 months, not long but we had a genuine connection and same personality and views on the world and life it\u2019s self, we would be the last ones awake at gatherings and would talk for hours and not run out of things to say, I had not had such an easy and calming connection with someone before, I saw him as another me maybe even a brother who I haven\u2019t know for long but it felt real and I loved him a lot and cared about him like crazy) I had sympathy for him at that moment and was trying to find everything excuse for him to not be in the wrong, \u2018he is sleep moving, he wouldn\u2019t do that if he was awake, boys do that somethings and get really embarrassed in the morning and it all becomes a weird uncomfortable joke what u will both get over as u are so close\u2019 or \u2018maybe he thinks I am awake and as I didn\u2019t do anything or say no he thinks I want this\u2019 \u2018maybe I want this and I should just go along with it so I don\u2019t lose him as a friend and it changes the whole situation into something not so rapey and something more light and less fucked up, I don\u2019t want to be assaulted so what is I just pretend like I want it\u2019  but no I didn\u2019t say I wanted it and even if he is asleep, I am not and i definitely don\u2019t want this and I was disgusted at myself for even thinking those things, if this was anyone else I would be so mad, why am I making excuses for a boy who broke my trust when I needed him most.\n\nThe room was completely silent, He started smelling my hair and the back of my neck.\nThe sound of him smelling me made me want to scream and throw up, now even more than before I was frozen, holding on to my chest as tightly as I could without it being too obvious, this was almost subconscious.\nIn my head I kept telling myself \u201cOne more second before I turn around and do something, he will stop, he is sleep moving, Toby wouldn\u2019t do this\u201d it was almost as if I wanted to save him the embarrassment and save myself the uncomfortable conversation and situation.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop.\nHe held my hips and started to push his penis into my bum.\nI wanted to die.\nI wanted it to all be a bad dream.\nHe started to thrust his hips back and forth and pulling me in everytime.\nI was frozen. \nI was mad, not at him but at myself for letting it get to this point, and also for not being able to move. \nMy brain and heart were aiming for different things. One was wanting to turn around and protect myself and express my heartbreak that he caused, and the other wanted to pretend like this never happened and if I played along that I was sleeping then none of this would really be reality.\n\nHe then spoke.\nHe said \u201cwhat are you gonna do anyways, your asleep\u201d\nThis hurt so badly, because it all became real, it all confirmed that the lies I was telling myself to be okay with it was a lie that I was gaslighting myself, I was gaslighting myself to protect someone who was sexually assaulting me. \nThis made it so clear that I had no respect for myself and oh my god I was so hurt. How could I allow this, I am meant to protect me. \nNo one has protected me all my life but me.\nI let myself down for one of the first times.\nThe way I dealt with disappointment from others was by telling myself \u201c we will be okay, I have you, you understand yourself like no one else does, you are the one that goes out and gets shit done for yourself, you are the one who really truly has yourself and I love me and it will be ok\u201d and that day I let myself down to the deepest level.\nThis was more than sexual assault to me.\nThis was so much more.\nThis broke my soul into peaces.\nHe damaged the trust and love I had built for myself that took so long and took so much hurt and pain to finally achieve.\nHe also made a comment on the face he was making saying something along the lines of \u201cugh why you always making that face man\u201d, he sounded insecure, embarrassed or annoyed at himself.\nThis made me picture him dry fucking me and made it even worse, great I couldn\u2019t even have a blank image of him doing this, I wasn\u2019t even imagining him or what was happening, I was too busy thinking and that comment made me think of him and what he was doing, he didn\u2019t even let me have that, all my control, and self respect diminished just like that, taken by a fucking man.\nI felt disgusted, I felt pathetic, I lost all respect I had for myself and also lost one of my best friends.\nI lost everything certain I had.\n\nHe stopped dry humping me after a few minutes I am not sure what exactly happened after as my brain is foggy and don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because I disassociated or he stopped and I fell asleep, because all I cared about is that he stopped the worst thing and so maybe my brain was relieved and just shut down and slept??? I don\u2019t know, but I know at some point after he stopped I got the balls to move and so I took a deep breath and got on my feet to go to the bathroom, not too loud to not make it seem like I was pissed off or to potential wake him up or to have him know that I was awake the whole time but also because I didn\u2019t want the option of pretending that I didn\u2019t know what he did to go out the window, I wanted to give myself the choice of pretending like nothing ever happened and to make it seem like I thought he was sleeping and didn\u2019t want to wake him up but also not too quiet either because half of me wanted him to be scared, I wanted him to not be able to sleep, questioning if he got caught, I wanted him to be scared shitless that maybe I wasn\u2019t sleeping, why should I be the only one to suffer?\nAlthough this is not enough it gave me a sense of control which I so desperately needed to feel.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going\u201d he asked me.\n\nMy heart sank as now it was proven again that he was more lucid than I hoped, this also made me feel better as it gave me more certainty, yes it did hurt to know he was awake but it made me stop defending this fat fuck.\nIt made me angrier and I needed to get justice for myself.\n\nI replied with simply and shortly with \u201ctoilet.\u201d\nI stayed in there not thinking at all just feeling what I was feeling, sat on the toilet lid with my foot up on the edge hugging my knees, staring at his stupid bathroom wall.\n\nI wish I slept in the bathtub instead of going back.. whatever, too late now.\n\nI came back in the room sat in the bed as I saw his arm was across my pillow, I sat up hoping he would move it, fuck it I\u2019m laying down, \u201cdo u want me to move my arm?\u201d Yes u fucking Ogre what the fuck do u think? How dare u even question that? What went through your mind that made u put it there in the first place???? Was it a test to see if I knew or not ?? Stupid mad.\nI said \u201cmhm\u201d fairly loudly, he didn\u2019t move it, I few moments go by, waiting for him to move, he still didn\u2019t.. so I pinch his hand with minimal fingers as possible and throw it down to his side (in between us).\nI then move as far away from him as I can in the bed and hold myself so he doesn\u2019t touch me. \n\nHe later on proceeds move the covers to hold my waist and he does but I was still wide awake so I make a big movement and he then faces the other side.\n\nThe nightmare was over, I got through it without something much worse happening,\nI just had to wait a few more hours to get up and go to college.\n\nI promised myself that is he did more I would go feral, sure I didn\u2019t trust nor believe myself anymore but I still made that promise.\n\nThe morning came, I got up before the alarm he set on his Alexa, it was 6:48.\nI put my headphones on and started to do my skincare, hoping he wouldn\u2019t wake up.\nI was tired and just wanted to leave, but I sat on his chair for a while contemplating what to do, do I go wake his mum up? Write a note telling her or him or both what he did and that I wasn\u2019t sleeping? What do I do? I sat there for a good 20 mins to 30 minutes or so thinking on the smartest thing to do and what would make me feel better but also won\u2019t make things worse for myself, I texting my groupchat telling them what happened and asking what I should do they all said leave or physically hurt him but I knew that wasn\u2019t the best thing to do although I really wanted to, I was prepared to leave and then I saw his headphones on the table, I wanted those for a while and was going to save up to buy some really nice ones but then I thought he just destroyed everything and took so much from me, this is the least that I can do.\n\nI put them in my bag and as he was awake by then I asked if he was coming to college \nHe said yes (he doesn\u2019t go to my college but still comes in as he has nothing better to do as he got accepted into a fashion college) and I left in a rush my heart was pounding and I was so confused I waited by the door and reevaluated my choices but realised that this was all I could do now.\nOn my walk to college I blocked him on Snapchat and instagram.\n\n\nI am a very much \u2018karma will take its course\u2019 kind of person, and I am 18 in 17 days and I am basically 3 years behind due to extreme unfortunate circumstance and family and personal issues and having to move to another country, so this is a really important time for me to get everything done and get my shit sorted.\nSo I was not going to report anything and I was just going to tell my close friends the deep details, but I wanted everyone to know.\n\nI stupidly posted on my Snapchat privet story about it and about the headphones and did a poll if I should jump him or not, trying to make a joke out of the situation and gaining some control back and even maybe to prove to myself that I can stand up for myself by telling others that I took his headphones???? I know pathetic.\n\nLater on he comes into college asking people if they have my contact and to message me as he couldn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t try very hard because he wasn\u2019t trying to find me but he was trying to show people that he was innocent and that all he wanted was his headphones and that I had taken them and blocked him out of nowhere.\n\nPeople showed him my story and he had the most guilty fake shocked face that was just been caught look, according to my friends that were there, he denied it all.\n\nHis friend snatched my friends (who was on the privet story) phone and took a screenshot and sent it to himself.\n\nNow he has proof that I took his headphones and that I did a poll on if I should jump him.\nHe went to the police station today.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t as I didn\u2019t want to cause more stress for myself as I don\u2019t have time as I have my exams now and they are the main and final ones that determines wether I can do my a levels or not, and also because I still cared about him and didn\u2019t want this to potentially ruin his life.\n\nI called the police and told them about everything and even the part about the headphones and the story and was as truthful as possible not sure if it will screw me over but oh well I wanted to be as honest as I could.\n\nI\u2019m scared, because the time I got groomed and told my male doctor and nurses that were taking care of me heard too, but they did nothing and he said that I was friendly with him so maybe I should just not be as friendly and comfortable with men, I was 14 in the hospital because of an overdose and had screenshot proof yet they still did nothing.\n\nNow I don\u2019t have any proof, except the unwashed clothes that I was wearing when assaulted me in but there is nothing on them so.. :/\n\nBut it\u2019s okay because everything will be okay and I am not in the wrong and I am doing everything I can to be a good person, that\u2019s the most i can do right now :)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "first, to clarify, no i cant get professional help. i cant tell my mom or anyone else in my family, im a minor (15), i still live in the same house. the only people i told about this were my 2 friends and they were horrified, though i want to ask more people about this so i can really make sure im not just going insane.\n\n\n\never since the pandemic, i've grown more and more paranoid of possibly being assaulted by my dad (and brother, but that's a whole other thing). short backstory, the only times i remember being assaulted was when a friend coerced me into sexual activity as kids (which im afraid to call COCSA). ever since then, ive been aware of sex, but not anything specific, just the activity alone. i deal with paranoia everyday, some days more extreme and some days subtle but still there, and i have reasons why im even suspecting this:\n\n\n\n1. 2-3 years ago, while i was sleeping, i set up a voice recording app, then closed my phone and let it run while i slept. when i woke up and checked, at one point in the recording, i heard the sound of thrusting. there's no other way to interpret the sound. (+ my parents are never intimate with each other. we all sleep in the same room, fyi. some days i sleep all the way through, some days i wake up several times in between - that night, i got full sleep.)\n\n\n\n2. ever since i was a kid, i've had pain in my vagina + pelvic pain even way before i got my period (at 12). my vagina would feel off and uncomfortable - the best way i can describe the feeling is that it felt like it was hanging off my skin. it just hurt. i don't know if that's a normal thing for girls or if that was caused by mistreatment, so please, if any of you relate to that or have an answer, let me know.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. i was a daddy's girl, until at one point, i just started being uncomfortable around him out of nowhere. it repulsed me whenever he touched me, and specific things like sharing saliva with him (thru drinking from the same bottle, eating w the same spoon, etc). i don't remember what caused that at all, it started and never went away. also, he was specifically the only person i was disgusted by, no one else - i didn't mind being touched and all of that by other people.\n\n\n\n4. again, ever since i was a kid, i struggled with sleeping, but it wasn't always that way. it just started happening out of nowhere at one point, and it was never the same again til now - id wake up in between my sleep even when there was no reason to (sound, lights open, etc), and i just couldn't fall asleep. basically, insomnia. i don't know whether or not that's related to this, as in it's an outcome of being possibly assaulted.\n\n\n\n5. other factors that contribute to this, like dreams (i recently had one where my dad was raping an unconscious girl + most times my dreams can be symbolic. the night before i got my period this month, i had a dream where blood leaked out of a tap), and other specific experiences, like when i overheard my dad telling my brother \"...she's still awake.\" (which could be innocent, but idk it was just so random...), etc.\n\n\n\nive read articles about the symptoms of CSA and i relate to most of it, and it scares me to think that i relate to it for an actual reason, that i'm not just being paranoid or that the paranoia came from somewhere - but i feel like i might go insane if i go without answers for any longer, so id like to hear from others who might have gone through something similar. if you have any suggestions on how i can seek out help and where i can get it from, please share them with me but keep in mind im very limited with what i can do without my parents' knowledge. another reminder is that i also have no street smart bone in my body, aka i can't commute on my own and i don't know where to even go.\n\n\n\ni just really want to know if i'm just going crazy or if this should concern me.\u00a0",

We\u2019d go fishing,swim, ride bikes in our small town all as friends. Over time he would start coming over in the arvo then go home before dark. As he got comfortable here he would spend the night to hangout with me and my brother, around that time we would be friends but make out, cuddle and sleep in the same bed but that was it. Fast forwarding he broke his phone so we lended mine and my brothers old phone and when he gave it back I made sure to see if all he\u2019s apps and photos was off our phone, doing that I stumbled across photos of my tits knowing that I was 100% unconscious, no clue and no consent to it, I was confused and fucking furious that leaded to me having a panic attack wondering who\u2019s seen it. I confronted him over the phone and it was just lies spilling out of his mouth. I then got a text from a girl we will call Stella, we didn\u2019t get along with each other due to her being deeply in love with Ben. She was ballsy to text and show me more photos and videos bc she logged in his account remembering the time he was over and someone logged in but he didn\u2019t know who, it had with my face in it and proof I was sleeping.  Ben took and had sent to an 18yold we will call Chris, I was 15 and Ben was 16. More denies after having proof of him and he\u2019s face in the videos filming my ass and then a  confession  he made to he\u2019s friend that was my friend at the time we will call nelson, Ben treated nelson like shit and chose to cut contact with me bc him and Ben had been friends for years and we\u2019d been friends for 6 months. A lot of people turned the tables on me sending me threats, abusive calls and messages tho those people had seen and been showed everything, me panicking showing ppl saying I\u2019m not fucking lying, even tho they really knew I was the victim and they didn\u2019t want to face he was the bad guy. I was an emotional wreck, I didn\u2019t have much support as my friends at the time didn\u2019t care and obviously brushed it off, I remember yelling at him drunk in front of everyone at a little gathering for my own brother to stand up for him and called a slut bag, whore bag and a liar.  since then we haven\u2019t really talked, and he still remains friends with him to this day from 3 years ago. And I still think of ways to torture him in his SLEEP. There\u2019s more to the story but my question is, is that sexual assault? Child pornography? Sexual harassment? ",

    "content": "There have been various nights over the past year where I have woken up to my boyfriend fingering me despite me telling him to not have sex with me while I'm sleeping as it reminds me of my sexual trauma. I've laid completely still and pretended to sleep as I have been raped and molested by previous men in different situations. The most recent time was Friday night. I woke up and angrily yelled, \"What the fuck are you doing?\" And his response was, \" Messing with ya.\" I made a loud \"ugh\" groaning noise and went back to sleep. I had a 14 hour work day coming up and had to sleep for that, as I am the only one working to pay the bills. \n\nThe following night I am getting into bed (fully clothed because I no longer trust him) and say \"Don't sexually violate me while I'm asleep.\" His replay is, \"Is this because of last night?\" And of course I reply, \"yes.\"\n\nWe lay there for a bit and he gets up saying he can't sleep because of what I said. He comes back in and says he thought I was awake because I wasn't snoring like I usually do (I was laying on my stomach) and was moving in my sleep. That he's not trying to gaslight me and he knows of my past sexual trauma. I asked him if he had ever done it to me before and he said no, not since the one time when I said I didn't want it. \n\nA week prior I had a 5k to run on a Sunday. He had done it to me that Saturday night before the race. It seems like he always picks times where he knows I need the sleep. I said, yes you did it on the night before the boilermaker. He denied it. We went to sleep, I got up the next day and worked another 12 hour day. However, 30 minutes before I had to be at work he said he wanted to talk. This job is my second job and customer facing. I can't be upset. So we avoid it. I also don't get home until 11 pm so I go to bed dressed and have my 9 year old son in bed with us too so I can sleep. \n\nToday he asks me if I'm mad at him on my way out of the door to my first job. He seems completely oblivious of any real wrong doing. \n\nNow I logically know this is definition sexual assault. It also hurt, which is why I woke up. But I feel like it's \"just fingering\" and not \"real rape.\" I guess I just wanted other women's opinions on if this is a normal feeling. Am I, an independent career woman, so indoctrinated that I believe that this isn't a big deal? \n\nTL;DR. My boyfriend sexually assaulted me in my sleep and denied past actions but I feel like since it's not piv that it isn't legitimate.\n\nUpdate: \n\nHe has seen this post and feels it doesn't represent him accurately. So for full disclosure for the first 9 months of our relationship he did work less for child care on my request. About the last 9 months I've been financially struggling hard and he had been looking for work. His hours our entire relationship had been part time. I still carried the emotional labor of saying what needed to be done despite him being home. His improvement after almost breaking up was minimal. \n\nWhen being broken up with he said he would likely kill himself. He said the same to my best friend, who then came over to make sure myself and my son were safe. He also told me that his life insurance in my name would cover the repairs on my kitchen that need to be done. As he had started a kitchen fire due to his messy nature. \n\nHis mother then called to tell me that her son is not going to kill himself and is not a molester. That we should work it out. She is old fashioned and a lovely woman, so I understand why she said what she did and hold no ill will towards her.\n\nFinal update: \n\nHe has moved his stuff out and is gone. He managed to get my neighbor to follow him to his brother's house 4 hours away. They are worried about his mental health. I can finally come home to peace. \n\nThank you to everyone for your reassurance and input. I appreciate it so much words can't express. I will be seeking out therapy myself. The strength to leave an abusive partner would not have been so great without all of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. \u2764",

    "content": "Basically, I got together with this boy, James, last May. He was very keen to make it more formal afterwards, and we started going out immediately. Things were fine at first, and although he was slightly overbearing, he seemed really caring and genuine. \n\nAbout two months in, I felt like we were getting closer, and that I owed him an explanation for several things. I often become distressed in my sleep, and at the time was breaking down quite a bit. I explained to him that I had been raped two years beforehand at a party, and that this was what was making me distressed in my sleep, as I dreamt about the event, and often woke up in a panic, crying and not wanting him to touch me. Around the same time was the anniversary of my friend's death, she died of a brain tumour when she was 12, and we'd also talked about this. Two weeks later, he became constantly, and visibly distressed, and locked himself for days at a time, and would call me all the time to tell me how sad he was. Eventually we spent an afternoon talking, and he told me that his 19-year-old cousin had recently been diagnosed with skin cancer. I'd never heard of this cousin before, but this wasn't particularly surprising, as we'd only been going out for two months. James said his cousin had only confided in him about this, and so his parents didn't know. A few days later, he told me his cousin had killed himself, and although this sounded quite dramatic, I didn't feel like I could question something that would be so upsetting for all involved. \n\nA couple of weeks went past, and James continued to seem very personally distressed, as if he was unhappy with himself. After a lot of encouragement from me, he decided to talk to me about this, and told me that, as a child, he was sexually assaulted by his female babysitter, his account included much violence, and that he had to go to hospital, with the babysitter claiming he had fallen down the stairs. He told me the woman's name was Katie. He spoke a lot about how this brought us closer together, and that, as similar people, the universe had brought us together. In an odd way this was comforting.  Again, the rest of his family didn't know about this, however after a family holiday, he broke down, telling them about this assault, and also told them that I knew. His parents and brother were understandably horrified, and called me repeatedly, asking to discuss the matter, and telling me they wanted to work with me to help James. \n\nAfter this, the therapy he was receiving, and the support from both his family and me, seemed to make him happier. However a few weeks later, he was shamed on Facebook when obscenely explicit pictures and messages he had sent to the (presumably fake profile) of the admin of a large group were made public, and all of our friends instantly knew. Obviously I was angry and upset about this, but under the circumstances, I felt like this could be part of a deeper issue, I didn't want to hurt James more at such a vulnerable time. When I was asking him why he did this, he was adamant that someone else had been in control of his account, although it quickly became clear this wasn't the case, as he used all manner to lies to circumvent that fact that the pictures were of him, he told me these pictures were for a friend who wanted to see whether James still self-harmed (I had never been aware he did, despite obviously seeing him naked).\n\nAround the same time, and I appreciate this story is sounding quite dense, but please bear with me, he claimed that a mutual friend of ours, who was in a relationship, had tried to get him to sleep with her, and had made a move. Knowing the friend, this sounded implausible, and I argued we had a duty to her boyfriend to let him know what was going on. James then impersonated her, using an app to both send fake texts to himself from her, and receive multiple fake calls. These texts said that she didn't want her boyfriend to know, and that she'd made a mistake. When I told James that I wanted to talk to her, he said I couldn't, because she had a melanoma, and was worried about cancer, knowing this would be an emotional issue for me. I eventually asked her about this anyway, and she denied everything, confirming my suspicions. Because of the deception and fraud associated with this, our friend went to staff at our university and told them, but James avoiding serious punishment when his family let the university know about his sexual assault and recent emotional turmoil. \n\nAt this point, James's lies were spiraling out of control, and he continued to claim all of his lies had been truthful. His family, and especially his brother, were torn apart by James's sexual assault, and his brother, who is a year younger than him, was worried he might also have been raped, but didn't remember it, and was becoming very distressed about this. Furthermore, his family were extremely worried they had subjected his 7 year old sister to a pedophile. They are trying to track down the babysitter, and he told them it was a babysitter they used called Izzy, who is a real person, and who James's brother told me afterwards was unnerving. \n\nTwo nights ago, I confronted James about the texting-episode, he admitted that just this was a lie. However, knowing this, I began to question everything he'd told me. The story didn\u2019t add up, and from the varying name of the babysitter and the fact that his parents had never mentioned the hospital visit to me, I felt like questioning was justified despite the issue's sensitive nature. After hours of pleading for the truth from him, and constant alterations to his stories, he eventually admitted that both this, and the death of his cousin had been fabrications. He tried to justify this by saying it was the only way he felt he could be close to me.\n\nI feel terrible that I have caused his feelings of inadequacy and continued deceit. He's told me I cannot tell his family about these lies, even though they are breaking his family apart, causing his mother to relapse into serious depression, while his brother has begun to experiment with more dangerous drugs to cope with stress. I don't know whether I can tell his family, and I'm also worried about their continued pursuit of the innocent babysitter. After all these lies, I really don't feel like I can stay with him, but at the same time, he's clearly troubled, and I do want to help him, not to mention how appalled his family will be if I leave him now, in light of their perception of events. What should I do?\n\n---   \n**tl;dr: Do I tell my boyfriend's parents and university that he was lying about cancer, rape, and family deaths, and can I stay with him/help him?**\n",

    "content": "**\\[TW: Explanation about being Sexually Assaulted, readers' discretion is advised\\]** \n\nThe first time he SA'd me, I was around 13. I used to live in an apartment complex with my little brother and sister, and my mom and her husband A. Before we lived there, we had to live at my grandma's place, because my mom couldn't afford to take care of my siblings and me on her own, while A was in prison for 6 years due to driving an 18-wheeler that held a cargo filled with narcotics. He lied for a while that he never knew they were in there, but it came up later in life through my mom's words that he knew what he was doing. He was supposed to be in prison for more than 6 years, but was released early for \"good behavior\". He changed his ways by turning to Christ. \n\nAt the time I loved and cared for him, assuming he was the only father I've got, considering I was told my biological father left me under my mom's care while moving to Michigan with another woman he knocked up when they were teens. So when A was finally released from prison, my family and I were excited. We ended up getting an apartment later on, and I finally received my room after sharing it with my little sister for so long. I remember that because he was in prison for so long, he couldn't get a suitable job, so he instead started building up his own mobile mechanic business, and on the side would hold sermons in a vacant apartment preaching the word of God. \n\nThis went on for a good while, and even now it baffles me how I never saw the red flags coming from him after he was released. He's a con man in his business and still is today. He would cheat on my mom behind her back while she was working, by either talking to other women, looking at them seductively and at one point was even caught kissing my mom's old friend. He would--and still does--rub off on people the wrong way. There's no doubt in my mind that if someone were to look at him or be near him, you can feel that there's something incredibly off by him. \n\nOne night when I was around 13, I remember sleeping in my bed facing the wall; my bedroom door was across from me. Normally I would keep my door unlocked because nothing has ever happened to me, until that night. I had awoken from something brushing up the back of my thigh. At first, I thought it was my cat, but I realized that it was fingers grazing my skin from behind. I froze there, pretending I was asleep and still facing the wall while this continued. I started hearing heavy breathing from a man, and he started to glide his fingers up the back of my thighs and over my butt cheeks and then tried to go in between my thighs from behind. My palms are sweating just typing this down because aside from having to tell this to those close to me this year, it's extremely hard for me to explain in full detail exactly what had happened from my point of view online. I was so terrified, frozen in fear, and I wish now that I had the courage back then to confront A for doing this to me; to a minor, that was supposed to be his daughter. \n\nIt felt like an eternity, I wanted for him to stop but he just kept on touching me in all the wrong places, and finally, the touching stopped and I heard him leave my room and close my door. I immediately sat up from my bed and started to breathe heavily from what just happened, and I remember a certain tick I started to do at the time. It involved the tips of my fingernails violently grazing over my thumbnail back and forth, making a loud \"clicking\" sound, and even to this day when I'm reminded of this trauma (or something that terrifies me to the core), I continue to do this. My bedroom door suddenly opened, and A was the first person there; disgustingly, he pretended as if he had found me traumatized, pretending as if he wasn't in my room just a moment ago touching me while I was \"asleep\". The moment I saw him, I screamed out for my mom as loud as I could and started crying, still violently clicking my fingernails over my thumbnail. A panicked, and when my mom came to my room to see what was going on, he lied by telling her he just found me screaming and having some kind of nightmare. He then left the room, and my mom closed the door and came to me to hug me. She asked me what was wrong, and I was too shaken up to explain what just happened. Eventually, I told her that A was touching me in my sleep, and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She stayed with me for a while, comforting me until she told me to stay in my room, lock the door, and wait until she calls me to open the door for her. I did as she told me, and she was gone for a good while until she finally came back and slept in my room for the rest of the night. \n\nI was told she kicked him out of the apartment, and he ended up sleeping in his vehicle for the rest of the night. The next couple of days rolled by, I was still scared and my siblings didn't know why (they were never told of this until years later when they were older), and A was suddenly back inside the apartment living with us. I was very confused as to why he was still there, why he was crying to me and apologizing for doing such a horrible thing to me, and I recall my mom asking me \"do you want him to still live with us?\". I honestly don't know why she asked me that in the first place. Why the hell was I given such a question, a decision that was thrown onto me when SHE should've been the one to have ended things right there and then without asking or giving him a chance? I was young, I didn't know what to say or do, and so he continued to live with us, and things went back to normal; a loving happy Christian family. To them it was normal, but for me, it wasn't. I was stripped from my innocence, and I was so depressed, I felt like no one had believed me, and just brushed the shit under the rug like it was nothing. Like I was nothing. I thought that if everyone is forgetting and going back to normal, it should be the right thing for me to do the same, right? So I did, but for all those years of living under the same roof as him, I felt so terrified, and I was so scared to tell anyone, especially classmates, my friends, and other family members, in fear of them not believing me or just ignoring the fact that me--a minor--was sexually assaulted by her stepdad while she was sleeping. \n\nIt never really stopped there though, even when I was told by A that he would change--again, and again, and again. The drinking started more, especially when we all moved into our first house 2 years later, and every day and night I would feel his eyes on me. They were the same glances he would give to other women like I was some kind of prey. I stopped wearing pretty clothes and began wearing unappealing ones (baggy clothes, jeans, and a zip-up sweater), I even had my long beautiful hair cut off and dressed up like your average tomboy/emo girl. I stopped wearing shorts, dresses, literally ANYTHING that could capture his eyes, and would always retreat to my bedroom after having dinner with him and the rest of the family. I PRAYED that he would find me unattractive so that I would never go through that trauma ever again, and for a while, it worked on his end, but at school, it felt like that night all over again. \n\nI remember back in my freshman year in high school, there was this 18-year-old guy that would always hit on me in gym class, and he would always try and get me whenever I was away from the rest of the students and gym teacher. He would touch me in the wrong areas, whisper in my ear, kiss me, would make me feel uncomfortable, and once again I froze and did nothing. Luckily with this occurrence, he was caught and arrested for sexual assault, and I never saw him again. I honestly wished that had happened to A.  \n\nA couple of years passed on, and throughout those years I would unknowingly try and throw myself upon boys in high school, craving those sexual touches from them. I dressed a little better, let my hair grow long again, and would try to wear makeup for them. I was \"too nice\" for them though, and every guy I would date in high school would leave me high and dry because they would receive a pinch of guilt whenever they would experience the nice sweet side of me. Yes, I was one of those girls the jocks or popular guys would dare each other to try and score; just thinking about it now is making me feel fucking sick. But they never went further than just groping my breasts, because eventually they would stop and say \"I'm sorry, I can't do this...you're just too much of a sweet girl\". \n\nI eventually kept to myself and stayed focused on my schoolwork and art--tried to, at least. There were some occasions where I would think of hurting myself or even CS, but I would only do things like violently scratching my forearms or using a thumbtack to scratch the surface of my skin up, but nothing far from that. I was finally 18, and I figured things were finally going on the right track until once again, it happened. This time, A was drunk.  After what happened the first time, I began to lock my bedroom door. I guess this time he was able to unlock it while I was sleeping, and this time he woke me up by crawling into my bed and spooning me from behind. Surprisingly enough, I was facing the wall again when this happened. While spooning me, his hand clutched at my stomach dangerously near my breasts, and he was holding onto me tightly. I could feel his breathing near my ear, and I had frozen up again at that point. Fortunately, that didn't last long, as I finally got the courage to move away from him, pushing him off the bed, and threatening him to get out of my room or I was going to do something he was going to regret. He looked at me dumbfounded and then left my room. I quickly ran to my door and locked it, and I don't recall going back to sleep after that. I never told my mom or anyone about this, literally anyone, until I met my husband when I was 24. \n\nWe were just co-workers at a security company in an exterior mall, he was dispatch and I was just a security officer. I stupidly drove a security vehicle over a boulder (don't ask me how it just happened and we still laugh about it till this day) and I thought I was going to get fired, but my supervisor said my \"punishment\" was to work dispatch and not drive their vehicles ever again. So low and behold, my husband became my trainer at the time, and the more we worked together the more we became best friends. I liked him a lot, even when at the time I was with someone else who I really didn't like back, and it wasn't until a couple of months later that he finally confessed he liked me a lot. In short, we ended up getting together, and we clicked so much from then on. It wasn't until a month later when we were hanging out in his car after work (I remember we were hearing an album from Led Zeppelin) that we were having deep conversations about our childhood, and I finally got the courage to tell him all about mine. How my stepdad SA'd me twice in my life, how nothing happened to him when he was caught, and how he was still living under the same roof as me. I explained it all to him with no sadness in me, no anger, because I felt that if no one was going to take me seriously, then I wasn't going to take it seriously when explaining it to someone. Like it was nothing. I didn't expect his reaction after telling him. The look of anger and horror in his eyes, sympathy for me. His mouth was wide open like he wanted to say something but couldn't get the words to come out. He held my hands tightly, and asked me in such a serious tone \"why the fuck are you still living there??\" and \"why hasn't anyone done something??\". I didn't know how to answer those, because even I was wondering the same thing. I told him \"we're a Christian family, we have to forgive the sinner no matter what\". Mind you, he's an atheist, and he honestly wasn't taking that bullshit, and I now know why. He told me flat out \"fuck that\" and that A is 100% a pedophile and should've gone to prison again for what he's done to me. Something should've been done, I should've been taken care of more. I even was defending my mom at the time of the conversation, but in reality, he's right; her not doing anything shows her being as guilty as A. \n\nHe then made his decision on getting me out of there and finding us an apartment to live together in. I was shocked to have found someone that actually listened and cared, so I agreed and we immediately went searching for an affordable apartment that was near our work, and I quickly packed up all that I had in my room and left. It's been 3 years since then, and we've finally gone deeper into our committed relationship and got ourselves our very first house. Two years ago I was still in touch with my mom and A, but after having a spiritual awakening in December 2021, and finding out back in March 2022 that obviously NOTHING has changed on A's end and he was caught talking to 4 different women behind my mom's back, I finally said \"enough is enough\", and cut him out of my life completely without notice. Of course with this, it led to a family disaster. My sister called me selfish at one point out of anger because that's her biological father, and my mom (even now) is in her own little world that if she prays hard enough and tries hard enough, she can fix everything and we can all be a happy family again. I've learned to put my foot down on them many times and made it clear that I NEVER want to see A ever again. I don't claim him as my dad anymore, nor stepdad, family member, or whatever. He's absolutely nothing but trash to me. I said \"fuck you\" to god and steered myself towards spiritual/Wiccan work, and have been doing all that I can to self-heal. I've gained a small yet loving group of friends that actually care about me, love and support me more than what I've received in the past, and I'm now working as a full-time freelance digital artist. \n\nSadly though, my mom is still with him, though they're at a point where there's absolutely no love in the relationship, and they live together like roommates. She would wake up, get ready and go to work, come back home, make dinner, relax, and go to sleep. I see pictures of them on her Instagram all the time, smiling at the camera and pretending to be a happily married couple of 25 years--I see nothing but lies and pain. She says she wants to divorce, though at times it feels like that might not happen anytime soon, considering he's good at one thing; manipulating her. He says he's going to change, says he's going to counseling for his alcohol addiction, depression, and other shit, especially since his parents passed away earlier this year. Hell, he's even at one point told my mom that perhaps it's best he unalives himself so that everyone can be happy, another sign of him manipulating her into staying with him. As harsh as it may sound, I could care less about his well-being. I know things will never change, and I'm glad he's mentally suffering right now.\n\nHave I developed over the last year? I think so. My husband and my mom and grandma say that I most definitely have. I really thought so until I started to receive night terrors, and even now they're getting worse. I keep getting nightmares of A either yelling at me, chasing me when I'm trying to run away from him, and even nightmares of those nights of A touching me in my sleep. I would feel incredibly drained from not getting enough sleep, and I'm always afraid to go to sleep for fear of getting these kinds of nightmares again and again. It's 1 am right now, and last night I had two nightmares about him doing something to me. I was told writing my story down would help, so here's to hoping this works.\n\nIf you're reading this, and you've been a victim of SA or know someone that is...know that you're/they're not alone. Regardless of improving over the years, I still feel like shit, but I know now that I can finally be open about this, and know that I'm not the only one suffering. I hope you can too \u2665 much love to you, and I hope for the greatest on your end.",

My girlfriend is back home working as a nurse and we've been in a long distance relationship for two years without issues. I love her to death.\n\nI live in a dorm and across the hall from me lives a girl called Megan. Megan and I are good friends. She's nice and sweet but I don't find her attractive at all. She belongs to a group of good friends of mine. \n\nTwo months ago my father passed away in a car crash. I was horrified and shocked. The pain was unbearable, but I got enormous support from my family, girlfriend and friends. Even Megan. But Megan's way of supporting me seemed odd. She kept sending me flirty texts with winking smileys telling me she'd do anything to cheer me up. This was completely odd and unnatural behavior from her. I thanked her, but told her I would be okay. \n\nOne month ago my brother came to visit and we threw a party we're we got shit faced and let our emotions pour out. I passed out fairly early. I woke up with Megan next to me in my bed, both of us fully clothed. I got so angry and worried and guilty. But my brother, a good friend and Megan all confirmed nothing happened between us, we'd just slept next to each other. She claimed she thought she couldn't leave me alone because of my drunken, grieving state. \n\nI got mad, but got over it. For a while I felt violated, but decided not to tell my girlfriend since nothing happened. But after this Megan kept sending me flirty messages and so on, asking me if I was okay. I acted cold and dismissive to her. \n\nThen we went out two weeks ago and got pretty drunk again with a group of friends. I had to be helped home and Megan stepped up to help. She helped me to my dorm and I immediately jumped in the bed, starting to sleep. I even acted harsh towards her and told her to leave and flipped her off. When I woke up she was still there sleeping, fully clothed. Again nothing happened. \n\nI feel so violated and I don't know if I'm overreacting. Maybe Megan is trying to be a good, supportive friend? Maybe Megan is using my father's death to hit on me while I'm vulnerable? In my head I keep going through these horrific scenarios where she's raped me in my sleep or taken photos of me, fearing that she will use this against me if I tell her to back off. If I told my girlfriend about this, she would be deeply hurt. I know she has been cheated on in past relationships and that this would be a huge trigger for her insecurities. I love her so much and don't want to lose her because of this.\n\nMegan doesn't seem to find it odd that we have slept next to each other twice. But she hasn't told anyone to my knowledge. I'm also scared that if I start up any drama because of this, our group of friends will shatter and I will be left an outcast since I have social anxiety. What does Megan want? What's her end game?\n\nTL;DR;\nI fear a friend (23F) is hitting on me (21F) using my father's death and keeps violating my personal space although I have a girlfriend (26F).",

    "content": "This situation is very shameful and embarrassing to me and it shouldn\u2019t be. I was getting SA\u2019d in my own mother\u2019s house by white men. It\u2019s just very hard for me to talk about because it\u2019s a very complex situation and people wonder how something like this happens. Stuff like this happens more than people think. But I will start off that I have a very colorist delusional black mother that had black parents as well but wasn\u2019t taught the proper stuff from them about being a black women in this world. My mother doesn\u2019t understand what it means to be black. So she thinks white people are her friends. So I will just go straight into the story. My mom was working with one of my sisters (I don\u2019t really get along with my siblings, it all stems from how we were raised my mom didn\u2019t really prioritize us looking out for each other or being close so it put a strain on my relationship with them) and my sisters and siblings in general there is some deep seated jealousy from all of my siblings for some reason. But my mom allowed my sister to hire a construction company to renovate our house. I could tell something was off with them they just seemed very predatorial. And I am a victim of sexual assault so I just didn\u2019t trust them of course because they are strange men and I don\u2019t have to anyway but I just stayed to myself and let my mom and sister handle everything. The first day they came was to of course see all the work that needed to be done. I was rushing to an appointment I had and long story short I believe we didn\u2019t go back into the house because they were starting their work. But my credit and debit cards and I.d. went missing. I made a big fuss about it with my mom and told her not to allow these men (white and hispanic) to work on the house. I told her if they stole from your daughter what makes you think their going to do a fair job on your house. My mom being the ignorant person she is still let these white men work on our house when she had a vulnerable daughter in her care living with her. So I think once they realized they were still allowed to work on the house they figured she cared nothing about me which sadly they were right. They charged my mother 25,000 dollars for at most a 5000 dollar job and didn\u2019t even complete the work that they did do in our house. It was literally just a joke to them and all they wanted to do was harm me. So being the person that I am when they were done working on the house about two months had past and I was just upset that they ripped my mom off like that so I left a negative review. I didn\u2019t know they would take it as far as they did. But to be honest I felt like if I had left the review or not they had a plan to do what they did to me the review was just the icing on the cake for them to be honest. So October came then November came. One of our neighbors told us in october that they had seen a man and woman go into our house. So much stuff happened since then I don\u2019t remember what happened but I hate to say that I was a perfect victim for them. My mom is kinda slow and the whole situation they figured it would be easy to do what they did to me. I\u2019m not going to go too into detail about the sexual assaults but long story short. Between November 2024 and recently here in 2025 these men were sexually assaulting me in my sleep. The times I counted were at least 12 to 13 times. One might wonder why I didn\u2019t wake up. I have sever health problems I have a sleep disorder and other chronic health problems that cause me to be low in energy and bed ridden. I also think my severe depression at the time also influenced my sleep. But I knew what was happening to me. When it happened and when it didn\u2019t. And the way they were able to get into the house was because my mom gave them the house key. I didn\u2019t even realize this at the time but they had been plotting this from the beginning because my mother gave them the key to our house and I know they made a copy of the key because that was the only way they were able to get in without breaking in. This whole situation is just very hard for me to talk about. And I know the fact that I am black played a very high role in this happening to me. This whole situation has tremendously affected my mental health I don\u2019t feel like the same person unfortunately. I was betrayed by my mom. I was betrayed by my sister. These men came into a place where I was supposed to be safe at. They viciously assaulted me. I\u2019ve went to the hospital and made police reports. But this all happened in an extremely racist state. I won\u2019t get into all the details but I don\u2019t have anyone to protect me. And I\u2019m just at loss for what my options are. I stay in the place where I currently live all day. I have debilitating anxiety. This made me hate myself and I want to love myself but it has made loving myself and me being confident extremely difficult because I know their goal was to make me feel like sh** and it just angers me that such coward disgusting men did this to me and made me feel like this about myself. And the fact that I know they\u2019re getting a kick out of this and my pain and suffering. One of the times they assaulted me I was literally going to kill myself. I just don\u2019t know how to handle this I\u2019m scared to go anywhere. I don\u2019t trust the police because I don\u2019t know if these cowards have connections to the police and could find my address. I think about living in fear the rest of my life because unfortunately in this world being white gives you power and privilege. These men were constantly watching me and driving by our house. And I feel like they would have eventually killed me when they felt like the time was right. It\u2019s just a lot. And as a black woman I just don\u2019t know what I am supposed to do. I feel like I will always have to look over my shoulder for the rest of my life because of this situation. I will always have to look in fear. And these people just wanted to completely destroy my for their personal gain. And I don\u2019t know what to do. If you have read this far thank you very much I just want advise on how to navigate this situation as a black female with no close family. I have a dad. My dad is much better than my mom but unfortunately I don\u2019t even know if me moving with my dad would stop this situation. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I have been living in fear for so long. So if you have any advise I would really appreciate any advise. One of my worst nightmares I\u2019m living right now. Thanks in advance. Thank you.",

bad part of town.\n\nmy mom is and was addicted to alcohol and smoking, she smoked with me while she was pregnant, and i dont doubt she drank too. my mom is a terrible mother, and she should have never gone to that bar the night she met my dad. she is also immunocompromised, and as a result, has to take so much medication every day. she often had an issue with taking the wrong amounts of pills, which resulted in her being intoxicated, basically acting the same as if she was drunk, which we often mistook it for, being little kids.\n\nshe would put us into unsafe environments, taking us to campsites and leaving us unsupervised while she partied and got drunk with strange men. take us to her shitty ex bf's house and have sex loudly while me and my sisters, as well as the bfs own kid to hear. in july of 2021, she drove us across town to our grandmas intoxicated, nearly killing us. i had to be the one to save our lives, i was only 14 or 15, i cant remember. i remember clearly how when she got mad at me for suggesting we slow down, how she would push the pedal, making us go even faster. how she would drive on the wrong side of the road towards oncoming cars, and how i had to grab the wheel. i remember in late 2020, how she didnt wake up us to go to school, and how i went to her room to give socks, and then uncovered her in a pile of her own shit on the floor, mumbling and delirious. i went to school, and when someone talked to me i burst into tears, and hid in the hallway. i remember in 2020 christmas i spent it hidden ina  closet at my aunts, because mom was drunk and stealing alcohol from her sister, and how she ruined christmas that year. it still doesnt feel the same. i remember how as young as 8 or 9 years old, i had to be the mom, and take care of everyone including my mother. i remember how she would yell for me at 4 am for me to make her tea or soup, even if it was a school night. my mom would never play with me and my sisters, and spent nearly all her time in her room or at her ex bfs apartment next door.\n\nas for my dad, he tried really hard. i know he did. he would yell at us a lot though, because we were dumb kids and didnt clean the house. but i know he was just stressed out. we had to have cheese whiz sandwiches a LOT for school lunches, i still can't eat them.\n\nin 2017, her and my dad got me my first phone for Christmas, at 11 years old i think. worst mistake. i think i was groomed\n\ni would go on a chat room app, called chatr or something, i was lonely and seeking attention that my mother and dad would not give me, i talked to men online. you know where this is going. i got sent nudes, and this became normalized for me. i would start constantly masturbating because a bunch of old men encouraged me to. i think i might've told them my age too, maybe they didnt care. i got another game, called graal online plus, and i got into sexual roleplays late at night, because those interactions kept me from feeling alone. in 2018, i got into nsfw roleplays on youtube livestream content farm things, for fandoms i liked. i got snapchat that year too, and got sent nudes, although i deleted those chats, and later my dad found out about my snapchat and made me delete it. in november or December of 2018, i was 12. i was sexually assaulted at a sleepover at a friends house. i was sleeping on the floor, and my friend's little brother went through the effort to TIE me up with kids jump rope, and started touching my chest and crotch while i slept. i woke up cuz of it, and i froze. i remember him pulling down my pants, and him pulling off his pants, but i shook because i was scared, and he stopped before it escalated.\n\nearly 2020, i was cheated on. he had sex with another girl. and later that summer he asked me to go over to his apartment at 4 am, and he wanted me to jerk him off. i did. i was too scared to say no.\n\nin 2020, i met my groomer on among us of all places lmfao, during the height of its popularity. he was a year older, maybe a year and a half. very quickly it got sexual, and we started e-dating. i remember he fantasized about raping me, and straight up told me word-for-word \"if i want you i am going to be forceful\" and would flat out tell me when we met he would 'force the fuck' word-for-word. he would be abusive, going silent and ignoring me for hours when i upset him, constantly guilt tripping me for nudes. i remember one time we video called while eating dinner, and he wanted me to take off my clothes on call, and i didnt want to, so he ended the call and only talked to me after i profusely apologized. he was obsessed with getting me pregnant, even though i was only 14-15 at the time, he would constantly tell me about his need to 'fill me with his babies'. he would constantly sext me, and encouraged and manipulated me into sending nudes of myself. he also blamed me for my own sa, since the person who touched me was younger than me, saying 'he didnt know better'\n\ni think these experiences gave me a rape fetish/kink, as well as a breeding/impregnation kink/fetish. i still fantasize constantly about being raped, despite being in a happy and healthy relationship, i'm so messed up and disgusting.\n\ni ended up emotionally cheating on my groomer, which was uncool of me and i have learned from this, i fell for my other online friend who was very nice to me, and when i tried to break up with my groomer, he sent paragraphs upon paragraphs freaking out and threatening to kill himself. i ended up traumatizing the ex bf by drawing furry porn of our characters, and posting pictures of my legs on my instagram story, and being inappropriate with others by talking abt furry nsfw (i never had intentions to cheat, i didnt even consider it cheating and other things i really cannot remember) and i regret traumatizing him, i hope he's doing okay now. he eventually broke up with me over what happened and how it affected him.\n\nduring 2020-2024, i got into various dumb online dramas in the furry art community. i got amino, and that has permanently affected me, i will never feel safe online again. i was stalked, harassed, and had my characters stolen and ripped off constantly. i'm still being stalked now, i'm sure of that, by some psychotic individuals. i have diagnosed depression, anxiety and ptsd over these events. im hypersexual as a result, i have been ever since i was young. \n\ni've also been extremely obsessed with this video game character, and i have been essentially ever since i saw her. i wanted to be her so bad as a kid, and i often 'gatekeep' the character. i dont know why. i get so offended and upset when i see other fans of the characters, and it affects my life badly.\n\ni cannot be an adult. i am almost in a constant state of age-regression to the point my brain FORCES me to age regress in public settings, i cant control it anymore. i want to be a kid again, i never got a normal childhood. if you were blessed with a normal childhood, i BEG of you do not take it for granted. this is hell.  i want to be a kid again, hell i remember age regressing as a KID, acting younger than i was.\n\ni am messed up. i am constantly anxious.\n\ni suffer paranoia that i'm being watched and stalked constantly. i rarely go outside by myself anymore.  i often disassociate, nothing feels real. i have to ask my girlfriend if shes real, everyone else doesnt feel real. i only eat one meal a day, 2 at most. my back aches from constantly rocking back and forth. i dont feel safe anywhere that isnt my home. myself and members of my family suspect i have autism, but since i'm a girl it's harder to get diagnosed, and im nearly 100% sure i have OCD . if people who have autism and/or ocd, since i hear ocd is also a symptom on autism, please feel free to add your input, i can list everything that makes me suspect ocd and autism.\n\ni have a girlfriend now, i live with her and her family, i am safe, but still i cannot stop thinking about my past every day. if you had a normal childhood and healthy relationships with your family, do not take it for granted.\n\nthanks for reading, you are loved.",

    "content": "When I was around 10 my mom and I lived with her boyfriend because they had just had a baby together which is my brother. Her and her husband are still together 12 years later. Growing up my mom always told me to feel comfortable to let her know if anyone touched me inappropriately or made me feel uncomfortable. Yet when I was around 10 I had an experience I am questioning. I recently maybe two years ago in 2020 i had many resurfacing thoughts and called my mom crying and she knew exactly what I was crying about without me having to say anything. she asked me is it about what happened when you were 10 with my husband? I told her it was. Growing up I really didn\u2019t know how to explain or identify what happened to me. I\u2019m not sure what to call this is this sexual assault or was it simply nothing and why did it make me feel so uncomfortable and why does it affect me till this day? \n\nWhat would happen is my mom and my stepdad would go out dancing at night and leave me and my younger brother home alone we were just asleep by the time they left and they came back. Yeah I became to dread when they would go out drinking and come back late because my stepdad would come into my room while my mom was in the shower or was in the room distracted and he would stare at me. I first I remember he would come into my room which was next to theirs and just look at me from the door frame while I slept but I would usually wake up when they got home and pretend to sleep so I saw him. I believe I remember my mom coming up to him once and ask him what he was doing and he just said he was making sure I was asleep safe you know.\nAt this time they were going out pretty frequently and when they would get home what he did progressed instead of standing at the door frame and watching me sleep he started to come up to my bed and stare at me closer and he would touch my feet while I was asleep. A lot of the time I was already awake when he came into my room and he would touch my feet and I would pretend I was asleep because I was scared and didn\u2019t know what to do he would caress my legs and my feet. I dreaded every single time they would go out and he would come home drunk because I knew that\u2019s what he would come to my room and do. This happens so much and it makes me so uncomfortable I don\u2019t know how my mom never noticed. I believe this finally stopped when I had had enough and 10 year old me came up with a plan that the next time he would come home drunk with my mom I would scream and pretend that he woke me up before I would just pretend I would slowly be waking up and be confused but this time I thought to myself, I\u2019m going to make a scene. \n\nAnd that is exactly what I did as expected they came home from dancing and he came in my room and started to cross my feet and I started to scream and freak the fuck out and start yelling for my mom and my mom came in rushing to the room and saw him in there and I say screaming that he was touching my feet and my mom yelled at him and told him to get the fuck out of my room. I am glad my mom believed me and I believe they fought for a while but they eventually made up I\u2019m not sure what she ever told him since I was 10 at the time but he never came in my room again I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because he knew my mom was watching or if he had tried but failed because ever since that day my mom would tell me to lock my door at night. No I don\u2019t remember if I told her that It had happened multiple times. But we never spoke of it again until two years ago and she still has never brought it up again after that. My question is what do I call this was the sexual assault even though he never touched any other part of my body that I can\u2019t remember? \n\nBesides this that happened to me I also remember around the same age going into the bathroom after him to take a shower and as I start to address I see his phone propped up and I go and take a look at it and it\u2019s on a recording screen yeah it isn\u2019t recording I freak out I grab his phone and I exit out of the camera. I never brought this up to my mom I was only around 10 years old. After many years of thinking of this I\u2019m not sure if it was an accident that his phone was propped up at the perfect angle where I would be getting naked and getting in the shower or if they was on purpose since the button to record it was an actually pressed.",

    "content": "Hey all. My (31M) gf (30F) and I have been going out for about 8 months now and seeing eachother slightly longer. Before we were seeing eachother we were both with other people. Once getting together we spoke about remaining friends with our exes and agreed we\u2019d both be okay with that. My ex and my relationship has purely been platonic since our break up, occasionally she will send me funny screenshots of her tinder messages. My gf and I have a good relationship and we love eachother very much. We bonded a lot over many common interests and experiences and I think we\u2019re very good together. The only issue has been over a few weeks when we have been drinking. Occasionally she will get very angry and upset with me for talking to my ex. I was initially very surprised by this at as I felt we had discussed this conversation already, and I told her I would tell her when I talked to my ex and what we talked about if my gf had any worries to which she declined. I assured her that although we talk, our relationship was platonic and we were strictly friends. However (when drinking) she would very often spend hours yelling at me, being very rude to me, and (verbally) attacking me. I often ask her if we could just talk but I\u2019m usually told to \u201cshut up\u201d or just \u201ctalk to your(my) ex.\u201d It makes me feel very awful. If we are at my apartment, she will usually tell me she needs to go and gather her things and leave. I usually follow her out (because it is always very late at night) and try to talk to her. At that point I will usually get yelled at by her on the street about how I\u2019m a terrible boyfriend and to stop following her. This makes me very embarrassed and self conscious about my neighbors seeing or hearing. Afterwards she usually comes back to my apartment and goes to sleep. She apologizes in the morning but when I bring up specific things she tells me she does not remember at all. I understand what it\u2019s like to be drunk and upset and I always forgive her and we move on. I am not an angry or rude person and I hate yelling at or personally attacking anyone and I have expressed to my gf many times that I do not like it when people do that to me. I recently took a trip to a friends house and I will be honest I did not communicate with her well when I was traveling back home (I stayed an extra night at my friends house and fell asleep and did not inform my gf until the next morning). The other day I was shook awake by my GF asking if I \u201chad anything to tell her.\u201d I told her no and asked her what was wrong and she asked if I went to see my ex during the time I went to see my friends (my ex lives in a different state then my friends which she knows) I told her no and how that would be possible, and she told me she went through my phone when I slept and read my ex\u2019s and my messages, where she(my ex) asked if I wanted to hang out (play video games) which my gf knows we do. I had nothing to hide and my gf has told me multiple times that she trusted me and I trust her as well. I forgave her for going through my things but the more I thought about I realized how much of a violation this was (2 days ago at the time of writing) I had told her my phone password in confidence and she used it to snoop through my messages while I slept. She apologized and told me that she would never normally do something like that, and told me she would be very upset if I had done the same to her. In the past she had promised me that she would never snoop through my things or violate my privacy. I was obviously very hurt but I understood that it came from a place of insecurity and I forgave her. That same night however she had a few glasses of wine at my apartment and went into another rant of how awful I was, and how I made her go into my things by talking to my ex, and that she\u2019s glad that she did. I felt so absolutely terrible and violated. She then told me she wanted to leave and wanted me to drive her home and continued yelling at me as my roommate spoke to my brother on the phone. I walked out with her and asked if she really wanted to leave and she told me yes, and continued to berate me on the street (in front of my neighbors who happened to be out on their stoop) I was mortified. \n\nShe had a family event the next day and I had been invited, and she also spent that night telling me she didn\u2019t want me there. I said okay and maybe it would be easier if I drove her home in the morning. She agreed and went back to my apartment while still speaking very rudely to me. I tried apologizing and she kept telling me to shut up. The next morning I woke up early to her just leaving. I followed her out again and she continued to yell at me on the street, tell me to stop following her (uncomfortable for me in my neighborhood again) and insisted that she was sober and I should not come to the family event which at that point I had accepted that I was not going to. I then offered to drive her home and tried talking to her the whole time while still getting \u201ctalk to your ex.\u201d After dropping her off and getting back to my place I noticed I missed some texts and calls from my gf telling me to \u201cget my shit\u201d from her place and she didn\u2019t want it there. She called me and I told her I had just got back from dropping her off and she told me \u201ctoo bad\u201d I went back and got my stuff after asking her if she was sure. After I packed up all my things we got to talking and she told me she *really* wanted me over to talk. I was confused and further hurt at this point but stayed anyway. At this point in talking I realized how much I disliked how she spoke to me when she was drunk and the hurtful things she told me and told her. We were both crying and she explained to me her insecurities which I understand but I insisted she needed to trust me. I brought up again the things she said while she was drunk and she told me again she did not remember. She asked me if I still wanted to go to the family event that evening and I honestly told her I was drained emotionally and wasn\u2019t up for it. I don\u2019t believe she got overly upset but was clearly bothered by me not wanting to go. I told her again about her telling me she said didn\u2019t want me there but insisted she was just angry/doesn\u2019t remember. I told her I would go. The entire day I kept replaying her telling me she was glad she went through my things and that she didn\u2019t want me at the event in my head and it was making me sick. \n\nI still showed up to the event and had a great time but I couldn\u2019t shake that uncomfortable feeling that she didn\u2019t want me there in the back of my head even though she said she did. That night she asked me to stay with her for the night but I turned her down because I wanted to be alone. We talked about how we felt and she told me she confided in her friend who told her I wasn\u2019t being fair to her and we should break up. I understand that\u2019s her friend and she\u2019s on her side. I told her I wanted to confide into my friends but she asked me not to (my friends really like her and I don\u2019t think she wants them to think of her in a weird way) either way I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of having to wake up and chase her down the block or get screamed at. I left her place and I definitely fucked up by going back to her place AFTER leaving because I missed her and then leaving again. I missed her but I couldn\u2019t just be there for the night with that in my head. \n\nWhen I got home I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of getting yelled at and not being trusted and I still felt violated. We spoke today about it and we\u2019re not sure what to do to move forward. I told her I\u2019m hurt and I\u2019ll be okay but I need some time. She told me she\u2019s hurt from my talking to my ex still and acts out because of it, and she feels she invalidated any feelings she had by violating my privacy, but she doesn\u2019t want to be apart (I\u2019m not taking about a relationship break or anything just some physical time apart) \n\nTLDR;\nMy gf doesn\u2019t like that my ex and I are friends and can get really mean about it when she\u2019s drunk and went through my stuff. I love her but I don\u2019t know how to feel or move on",

    "content": "I'm sorry this is so long but I need to talk about this. I was m*lested as a toddler and I'm pretty sure it lasted a couple or few years. My sister is 2 years older and tried to make sure I never ended up in our uncle's room. (at our grandparent's house. He is in his 40s I think at this time) She even yelled at him when she was 5 or 6 that I wasn't going in there but I remember definitely being in there and on his bed and having out of body experiences. Like I was rising to the ceiling and couldn't see or feel very much of what was happening. My earliest memory was when I was 3. Another time I remember sitting on the floor watching a disney princess movie while someone was whispering in my ear to just keep watching the movie while I remember heavily breathing and being scared. I can't remember much else but I know our only supervision was our grandma who knew what her sons had already done to her daughters but did nothing about it. My mom being one of them so idk why my mom ever sent us over there to be babysat. It still baffles me. She knew her brothers were going to touch us and we ended up over there anyways. We were their prime targets. He is now a convicted and registered level 2 child sex offender. We didn't stop seeing our grandparents till I was 7 and she was 9. She was definitely messed with too or she wouldn't have known not to go into his room. I remember my uncle staring at us creepily anytime he was at our house. Idk why they were ever at our house either but I do know they never got the chance to do anything there. What I wanna know is why does all of this mean I keep ending up in abusive relationships? Verbally, sexually, and sometimes physically. It's like my fate was sealed when I was 3. Two exes have touched me in my sleep. My most recent one did. I left him a few months ago and got a place with my little sister. (no she was never touched in that house because our taking custody of her from my cousin when she was less than a year old caused a divide between households so we never went back after that). Every single time I had to hug and kiss my ex goodnight after he had done that I wanted to puke. I just didn't have anywhere else to go. But I planned for months to get tf out of there. 2 months after he did the thing, we were talking about how my libido plummeted. I made excuses as much as possible and he said \"yeah well I know how to get you in the mood even if you're sleeping\". I told him no I didn't like that and after a couple more months he finally stopped trying and a couple more months after I got tf outa there. Now when I think about ever being touched again I get nauseous. I feel like I'm 3 again and scared. I know I need therapy but it's just not financially in the cards right now. Hence why I came here. Since my last bf I keep having flashbacks to when I was 3 and 4 and so on. Is it bad that anyone near my uncle's body type just makes me nauseous? I feel bad but also every guy I've been with with that body type or similar ends up sexually assaulting or abusing me in some way. I had a 33 minute long flashback paralysis the other night and that's when I realized how bad it is. It's been a few months now and I'm not getting any better. It's been a couple years since I had a flashback paralysis thing. I think I'm so effected because I promised myself never again. I broke that promise. Even in my 30s I still can't make it stop from happening. Idk what's wrong with me where I can't meet someone who doesn't want to hurt someone else. ",

    "content": "I met my ex in 2012, right after I had just turned 30. I had only dated and been with women exclusively until I came out as bi-sexual at 28. Let\u2019s just say the year I was 29 was a busy year making up for what I missed out on. It was mostly casual hookups (yes, safe) and I did try dating 2 different guys for a few weeks, but it just never worked out or got serious. I kinda figured that I\u2019d probably end up marrying a woman or not getting married at all because I just didn\u2019t see myself catching romantic and sexual feelings for a guy. Then I met Ryan. From the first date it was just like the only other time in my life I had fallen in love\u2026butterflies, constantly thinking about him, wanting to spend every moment with him. He fell for me hard too and we became an item, though he did say while he considered my bisexuality a turn on, because he had a thing for straight guys, it also gave him pause because of my desires for the opposite sex and his concern it may lead me astray. I thought about it and understood it was a legitimate worry, but assured him that I couldn\u2019t even think about anyone else because I was really into him. Note: I knew he was the one by the end of the first month and I was in love, but I wasn\u2019t going to say these things too soon and risk scaring him off.\n\nOn our first date he admitted to me that he was legally blind due to a genetic disorder and that it was progressive and eventually he would only have a sliver of his peripheral vision. He immediately said he understood if I didn\u2019t want to see him again because no other guy had wanted to date him and be his driver all of the time. I grew up with a brother in a wheelchair who never learned how to walk or talk due to misdiagnosed meningitis at 6 months old back in the 70s. I told him that and said that what my brother had was a severe disability, so in my perspective, his blindness had no effect in my feelings and that always being the driver was a small sacrifice just to be with him.\nThe following years were bliss. We brought out the best in each other. My family who was surprised, but very supportive when I came out, adored Ryan and treated him like family and said that I acted happier since we\u2019d been together. When I met him he was working part-time in retail and had done very poorly in high school because he lost a lot of his confidence as his vision deteriorated. I told him that one thing I did insist on was that he do something with his life because he had too much to offer and that I would help. He said that he\u2019d wanted to be a teacher but didn\u2019t think someone with limited vision could teach\u2026.nonsense. So I put him through community college for 2 years, then 2.5 years of a local university and finally the 1 year teacher certification program as required by California. I drove countless miles and paid hundreds in public transportation costs for him, never blinking an eye or complaining.\n\nWe\u2019d been together for 7.5 years and were engaged to be married in October by the time he was in his last semester of his teaching certification which involved him student teaching at his former high school with his favorite teacher from his days in school. Then the pandemic hit and schools closed. Fortunately he\u2019d had enough hours in the classroom that he would still qualify to be certified after the Governor issued a waiver via executive order. On the 3rd day of the stay at home order in March my life crumbled when I innocently found out he had cheated on me with an ex all because he handed his phone to me to show me something on Instagram. I accidentally fat thumbed the back arrow when he gave it to me taking me back to a list of all his messages. I looked and recognized the name of his ex, Jonny, as the second message, dated a week ago. I clicked on it and my heart sank. Directions to my house, pictures, dirty talk, and reassuring Jonny not to worry about me because he had my location on my \u201cFind My Friends,\u201d just in case I came home from work.\n\nI immediately started screaming demanding to know everything and he admitted to having his ex over twice for sex and that they didn\u2019t use protection (Jonny was engaged to his gf during this, adding another victim). Then he admitted to sleeping with his straight but curious recently single cousin Tyler, twice, again no protection. Finally he admitted to sleeping with a supposedly straight guy named Tomas that he and many of my cousins went to school with who I told Ryan I really didn\u2019t like him or want them talking because I didn\u2019t trust him after what I'd read about him. Since they were never close friends I didn\u2019t feel like this was a big sacrifice or that I was being too controlling AND I assumed that he knew why I (and all my cousins) felt that way, but didn\u2019t bother repeating it. The reason was after high school at age 20 this guy was convicted of sexual assault and penetration with a foreign object against a 16 year old girl and had gone to jail and required to register as a sex offender for life. Apparently my ex was the only person in his graduating class that hadn\u2019t heard that news. All of this happened in my home while I was working. We spent the whole weekend crying with me asking over and over why and him repeatedly crying and saying he just didn\u2019t know and that he felt terrible.\n\nMonday comes around and anger started being as common as sadness and I made a comment that said I was going to pull all the phone records going back the 3 years that AT&T kept them (for a fee). Only when he heard that did he admit to one more guy. Some random named Frankie off the gay hookup app Grindr who was the first guy he cheated with and continued to casually hookup with for nearly 2 years with the last time being in February (the month before). He told me how it started. Get this \u2013 it was the DAY AFTER his graduation with his BA in May 2018 and he was drunk from celebrating and wanted to have sex. I too had been celebrating with him and said I was too drunk to perform and said I\u2019d make it up the next day, then passed out asleep on the couch. Apparently he was \u201cangry horny\u201d because he downloaded Grindr, chatted with this Frankie fellow and arranged to have sex in his car in a church parking lot across the street from our condo (which happens to be across the street from a school\u2026this fact is important later), all while I slept on the couch. All the times they hooked up after that was again in my condo while I was working or visiting a friend for the night up the coast (he used to love going but started saying he couldn\u2019t occasionally because of \u201chomework\u201d and \u201cstudying.\u201d\n\nI absolutely lost it, told him to get in the car and I drove him to his family\u2019s house so he could tell them what he did so they understood why he was moving back into their house. While he was in the house I was in the driveway on the phone with AT&T ordering the 3 years worth of detailed call/text logs, then made an appointment to be screened for STIs. I suspended his service until he could figure out how to pay for his own damn phone, then I temporarily changed all his passwords on the social media accounts he cheated with and to make sure he couldn't hide more evidence so only I would have access to his cloud (we shared each others passwords on his suggestions years before). I also called the bank and issued a stop payment on his final tuition check that I had sent to the certification program the week before and hadn\u2019t hit the bank yet. Before deleting his social media, except Facebook, I took screenshots of the entire Instagram conversation with Jonny the ex and mailed the conversation to his fianc\u00e9e, who deserved to know so she could see a doctor and get tested too. His family was very religious and had kicked him out in high school for 3 days when he tried to admit he was bi and only took him back in when he took it back. Needless to say, she ended it, he got kicked out. ONE DOWN.\n\nHe came back out to the car and we went home. I took his house key and told him to say goodbye to our 3 pets and get packing. The entire time he packed I studied those phone records to find out dates, times and if there was anyone else he was leaving out. He answered every question I asked and it was then that I discovered that Tomas the sex offender and he had only had oral sex in my home and that the actual sex was in the same parking lot he screwed the Frankie guy in.\n\nThe wheels started turning and the next day I walked over to the church and sure enough spotted a camera. I spoke to a secretary (sweet old lady) at the church and informed them about a registered sex offender having sex in their lot and that not only was it a violation of his parole for indecent exposure, but that he was not allowed to be that close to a school and I provided the date. I was in luck! They had a digital two year loop system that started deleting day by day after it had been retained for 2 years. It was April 2020 and he first cheated with Frankie in May 2018 and the sex offender was in April 2019. I told them I was filing a police report and that probation would require a copy of it eventually. They said they would save the file and allowed me a thumb drive of both days to submit with my police report. Within a month Tomas the sex offender was locked up again. TWO DOWN.\n\nI also filed a police report against the Frankie guy. The police said it was a relatively minor infraction but since it was across from a school playground and skate park they would follow up but there would be no jail time. I researched the hell out of Frankie and called him to confront him. He was smug and admitted to knowing about me the whole time. What he didn\u2019t know is that I had found out he had a job that required a security clearance and he had several judgements against him and collection agencies had been looking for him (best $ I ever spent on a data collection site). I didn\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t find him and just garnish his wages, but it ends up he was Hispanic and had two last names and was a Jr., plus he frequently by his middle name Francisco, Frankie for short\u2026so he got lost in the paperwork confusion. I sent a letter to the collection agencies providing his employer and current location and contact info and then sent a copy of the police report about misdemeanor indecent exposure for which he pled guilty and it was a fine with community service (not considered a sex crime). His wages did get garnished, but only for two paychecks because the misdemeanor was enough for him to lose his security clearance and get fired. THREE DOWN.\n\nThen I contacted Ryan\u2019s family on his mother\u2019s side pretending to be him from his Facebook account making sure they knew he had fucked his cousin Tyler. It spread through the family like wildfire and soon Tyler was contacting me because he couldn\u2019t get a hold of Ryan to ask why he would expose what they did. I just laughed and said you shouldn\u2019t screw your cousins, especially when they\u2019re engaged and that he\u2019d messed around in my house, so now it was my turn for payback. FOUR DOWN.\n\nLastly, I had already stopped payment but since he was so close to finishing I was sure his family would bail him out and pay the university. Like I said, indecent exposure is usually a slap on the wrist type misdemeanor. However, I remembered some of the paperwork he signed to be a mandated reporter that you could lose teaching certification for \u201cdocumented acts of moral turpitude.\u201d I sent a copy of both police reports from the parking lot with still shots from the security footage clearly showing Ryan\u2019s face to the school district he\u2019d been student teaching in and a copy to the Commission on Teacher Credentials. FIFTH AND FINAL DOWN!\n\nAdmittedly, I did all this out of anger but he shattered my sense of self-worth and made me incredibly bitter and untrusting after years of being generous and supporting him. Everywhere I looked in the town I thought of Ryan and the cheating. I felt a terrible energy in my condo knowing it all happened there. I stayed 9 months and watched all 5 of their lives self-destruct. Then sold my condo (making a nice profit) and relocated to the PNW to start over. One thing that is sad is I found out just recently that his ex-who\u2019s fianc\u00e9 broke up with him ended up committing suicide several months after I moved. It is too bad that his family was so closed minded to turn on their own son, but in the end, it\u2019s not my fault that he cheated on his fianc\u00e9 by coming into my home at my fianc\u00e9\u2019s invitation to cheat. Suicide is never the answer to ones problems and I hope the fianc\u00e9e he cheated on doesn't blame herself and that only his family does (as they should).\n\nTLDR: I emotionally and financially supported my ex through college and his teacher credential program for over 7 years only to discover he had cheated on me with 4 different guys, one of them the day after he graduated and then occasionally for nearly two years in my home while I was at work. I took my revenge: My ex lost his career before it even started and our relationship, one AP (affair partner) lost his job and had bill collectors after him, another lost his fianc\u00e9e and was kicked out, a third was humiliated when his entire family found out he had sex with his cousin and the fourth was put in jail for a violating probation. Lesson: Don't Cheat and Deceive or Fuck Around and Find Out.\n\nUPDATE: For those that haven't seen the original posts comments, yes, I did seek therapy. This was 4 years ago and after 18 months of therapy that didn't really help, I was referred to a newer therapy for PTSD called Ketamine Infusion Therapy and it was like magic. In 6 sessions over 3 weeks I was relieved of all my pent up anger and resentment and actually able to trust and date again. I am now happily married and settled in the PNW.",

    "content": "I know this sounds bad. I know, I know, I know. I just need to tell someone, someone who wont know who i am. When I (15f) was 6 years old (so 9 years ago) my (12f) cousin and i were hanging out in her room. We were talking and she suddenly said \u201cwhenever we\u2019re leaving you can kiss me goodbye\u201d we saw them often and our families are touchy people who hug and kiss everyone goodbye so i thought nothing of this. Then she goes \u201cwe should practice now so its not awkward then\u201d I said sure because i really looked up to her and I didnt think anything wrong of this. Kissing on the lips (just pecks) turned into her looking up \u201chow to french kiss\u201d and eventually making out with me. I never said stop. I never tried pushing her off. I never did anything to make it seem like i was scared or unhappy. Later in the night, my brother and her brother had fallen aslsep on the couch and we were in her brothers bed (a bunk bed) she kept trying to kiss me but i was saying \u201cwhat if the boys wakeup\u201d and she said \u201cthey wont\u201d about 20 minutes later, she asked if we wanted to have sex. I said sure but only if we did it on the top bunk because i liked the top bunk. I followed her up the ladder. I unclipped her bra. I let her slide my underwear off. She touched me, she went down on me and then just stopped. She said \u201cwanna go back to the bottom bunk and not have anymore sex.\u201d i said sure and we went back down. I wokeup in my sleep a few times to her kissing me. This continued over the next couple of years. When i was 8 we were making out. in the living room. in the middle of the night. right next to our sleeping brothers. and she started pulling away and kissing my neck. she usually did that, i was ok with that. then it started hurting, like she was biting me. i told her not to, that it really hurt. she kept doing it. I wokeup and my mom saw me, she screamed and asked what happened to my neck. 9 hickeys. we had gone to the pool the day earlier, i said i bumped my neck on the pool and bruised it. i had to wear a scarf for a few weeks. I wasnt raped. I didnt say no, i kept going. But if it wasnt rape or sexual assault, why is it so scary. Why 9 years later cant I tell my family what happened all those nights. Im still close with my cousin, I still see her. We dont talk about it, but i know just like how when we hang out all the memories flood my head. it happens to her too. I know, i\u2019ll slap her leg (as a joke) and she freaks out saying \u201cbe careful, dont touch near there\u201d while covering her privates. i regret it, i wish i said stop, or no, or anything.",
