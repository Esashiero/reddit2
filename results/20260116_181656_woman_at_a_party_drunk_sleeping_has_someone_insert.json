    "content": "Hi /r/rape. First of all, thank you for existing. I hope it's okay for me not to go into a lot of detail because this is obviously a very painful and personal subject. But I'm really in need of some help so if you guys have any advice I would love to hear it. \n\nBasically, I was in college a few years ago and was raped a handful of times by different people. One particular time stands out in my mind when I had gone to a party with my friends and gotten so drunk that I passed out and my friends propped me up against a wall. Long story short, a guy who was two years younger than me found me and took me to an upstairs stairwell where he raped my lifeless body and tried to force fellatio in a way that made me vomit on his penis. On the way home I have memories of him telling me that he didn't use protection but if I needed an abortion to let him know. This was only one instance, but I don't think anything in my life has ever made me want to die more than putting the pieces together of what he had done to me that night. \n\nFast forward, I am out of college now. I fell in love with my soulmate and we moved across the country together where I now attend post-graduate school and we are extremely happy together. He is the most amazing person I will ever know, and I feel fulfilled and grateful for our love in every moment. He knows and is understanding about what happened to me sexually in the past. I have no reservations with him and we have a very healthy relationship. It has been 3 or 4 years since the \"stair guy\" incident. \n\nHowever, lately I have been having rushing feelings of extreme rage and desperate sadness towards that incident and that guy in particular. Maybe it's because I know that he's out ther in the world living amongst his friends and family who have no idea that he is my biggest nightmare. Maybe it's that he totally got away with what he did to me, and he probably never thinks of it or feels any responsibility. Maybe it's that I see in our culture ideas that perpetuate rape culture on college campuses and I know that men and women are out there experiencing the same things I did and not telling anyone. Maybe it's because I still have his phone number and know that if I wanted to, I could make him regret what he did, but I don't. \n\nWhatever it is, I feel bad that so many years later now that my situation is completely different I am suddenly having flashbacks and rage to a time in my life that is over. I want to talk to my SO about how I'm feeling, but I'm worried that it will sound random or out of context or like I'm dwelling I guess? \n\nWhat do you think is best to do in my situation? Have any of you had similar experiences? I feel like my pain and my past is following me even when I have no reason to dwell on it. My story has molded me and made me stronger, so it feels weird to me that I'm wavering like this even when I have grown and moved on. I would appreciate any advice you guys have and thank you for being here. ",

    "content": "My ex, who was my boyfriend the time, sexually assaulted me repeatedly through out our relationship and the worst part was, I didn\u2019t even realise it was happening. \n\nTo anyone who is in a situation where you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s sexual assault, these are some instances where it is considered sexual assault and you have every right to take action. \n\n- when you\u2019re asleep / unconscious / drunk\n- when you agree initially but change your mind and they do not stop \n- when they coerce you into it\n- when they guilt trip you into doing things with them (e.g say things like \u2018we\u2019re never alone and now you don\u2019t even want to do anything\u2019 or if they start to give you the silent treatment for not having sex with them)\n- when they force themselves onto you (yes this happens in relationships too)\n- at any time if you said no/ were unsure/ uncomfortable and they still continued \n- unwanted sexual contact or touching\nforcing victim to perform sexual acts (i.e. oral penetration or other forms of sex)\n\nrape: unlawful sexual intercourse or penetration of the victim\u2019s body by a body part or object\n\n\nRape and sexual assault happens in relationships too. Just because you had provided consent once, does NOT mean that your partner has ANY right to your body as and when they please. You are a person with your own wants, needs, emotions, feelings, etc. You do not exist to please others sexually, especially if it\u2019s at the cost of yourself. \n\nEven if 5 people read this, I\u2019ll be content knowing that 5 more people are now aware that it is okay to not realise what is happening until much later on, it is okay to have felt hopeless, but ultimately it is NOT okay that they did that to you. It is NOT okay and you should never, ever blame yourself for any aspect of it. \n\nOne of the things many asked me when I finally left him was, why didn\u2019t you say anything sooner? At the age of 17 (this was 3 years ago), I was naive. I wholeheartedly that this 20 year old man loved me for who I was and not for my body and the things he did to me. I was wrong. If I didn\u2019t want to give him a blowjob, this man child would quite literally guilt trip me and throw a fit, making me think that I was in the wrong for not making him \u201cfeel good\u201d. I now know that he is nothing but a guilt tripping, victim blaming, narcissistic, egoistical rapist. \n\nPart of the reason I never expected this to happen was the fact that I grew up very aware of the threats of sexual assault and what to do if it happened to me. Unfortunately, in my mind, the perpetrator was always painted as a strange man following me home at night or a creepy uncle at family gatherings who stared at me a little too long, never the \u201ckind\u201d, \u201cloving\u201d man who happened to be my first love. Sexual assault can happen anywhere and anyone can do it to you. You are not alone. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of being judged, it is never your fault. If something like this happened to you, I am so sorry, you didn\u2019t deserve this. Seek the help you need and I highly encourage you to make a police report. Too many sexual assault and rape cases go unreported due to the victim feeling \u201cshame\u201d. It is nothing for you to be shameful of, you didn\u2019t ask for this, they should be ashamed of the fucking disgusting people they are. Whatever your reasons for not reporting it may be, I completely understand, I didn\u2019t report my situation for a long time either because I didn\u2019t want to relive the hell that I went through until it struck me that he was just going to do it again. If he \u201cloved\u201d me as he claimed, and still did this to me, who\u2019s to say he\u2019s not going to do this to someone else. Could I live with myself knowing I let my rapist walk free and he rapes someone else? I would never wish that upon anyone. However with that being said, no one would ever blame you for remaining silent. The most important thing is for you to heal from the trauma, however long it may take, people and resources are here to help you. \n\nThe first time I had dealt with sexual abuse from this man, he had forced himself onto me despite me pushing him off and telling him to stop. He raped me and as I was telling him no, he told me \u201cit would be quick\u201d. Sure, his sexual satisfaction came quick, but the trauma I have had to deal with did not take a short time to process. Someone who loves you wouldn\u2019t do this. He was and is a terrible person. It takes a special type of fucked up person to do something like this, to look someone in the eye and see them scared and hopeless and choose to rape them. \n\nYou are not alone. I hope my sharing of this experience has helped someone, it\u2019s definitely helped me. Take care of yourselves, be safe\ud83d\udc95",

If anyone DID read the whole story, and has thoughts/advice/opinions can you please specify that in your comment? Thank you!!!\n\nI\u2019m a 21 year old woman.\n\nI have never been in any kind of relationship until this point.\n\nso about a month ago I met this guy (let\u2019s call him Uno) at the bars near my university. For context he had a \u201cstreet name\u201d and I didn\u2019t know his government name.\n\nThe first time we ever interacted I was with my (now ex best) friend (let\u2019s call her alfredo) and a group of random people we had met at the bar. We\u2019re all chillin outside the bar after it closed, drinking smoking etc. I got flirtatious energy from Uno throughout the night, but i didn\u2019t think too much on it. i thought that was just his personality. He was kind of flirtatious with Alfredo too.\n\nLater that week Me Alfredo and our other friend (well call her Ocean) went back to the same bars. I\u2019m ordering a drink when he suddenly comes up behind me and is like \u201chey!\u201d and im thinking in my head, \u201cI did not expect to see him again\u201d you know? but we say hey to eachother and start small talk, get a few drinks etc.\n\nMind you this man is like too good to be true. He\u2019s taller than me, very attractive, has tattoos, athletic build, manners, like i\u2019m swooning okay. I\u2019m outwardly confident, and i believe i\u2019m attractive, however I am a very thick curvy woman, and intimacy has never been easy for me. So i\u2019m honestly just shocked he even wants to talk to me when there\u2019s like a bunch of size 0 blonde college girls surrounding us. That\u2019s simply what i\u2019ve grown accustomed to being here at this college.\n\nSo we\u2019re talking, the energy is playful, flirty, and touchy. We\u2019re bar hopping as a group with my other friends, Ocean is playing wing women, Alfredo is low key being a hater. At some point he says something about getting my number, what am i doing after this, that kinda vibe. I am a virgin at this point, I\u2019ve had romantic/sexual experiences been never performed oral/penetrative activities. I tell my friends I wanna go to his house and maybe like give him head or something just to finally do it. Alfredo is like \u201cno bitch you should be getting head, not him\u201d and Ocean is like \u201cgirl do whatever feels like a win for you.\u201d\n\nokay i just wanna fast forward rq and give facts:\n\n\\- I told him I was a virgin at his place that night\n\n\\- everything was consensual\n\n\\- we were both heavily intoxicated and continued to drink beers at his place\n\nI let Uno take my virginity that night, and we continued to have sex for the next few weeks. He was always very sweet, gentle, and overall i liked being around him. He would do things that gave me \u201cboyfriend energy\u201d like opening doors, smacking my ass in passing, fixing my hair or makeup, let me wear his clothes, stuff like that. We even talked about what a relationship would look like drunk one night. But whenever we weren\u2019t together his texting game sucked. I started to feel like I was just sex to him, which had he said that\u2019s all he wanted, not this relationship BS, would\u2019ve been fine. I was cool being FWB/sneaky link, but the communication was overall ass.\n\nI started to learn more about him, I found out he was born in my home city, and had just moved from the neighboring state, where my family is from. He reminded me of home and i felt comfort in that. He told me that he had been in jail over something dumb (didn\u2019t specify) and was trying to start over, which is why he moved out of the state. He told me his real first name, but never his last name. He said he preferred to go by his \u201cstreet name\u201d because of people from his past essentially, and asked me to call him by that name. The relationship was so new, I didn\u2019t wanna risk it falling apart so I didn\u2019t question it. Context: I have been exposed to this lifestyle throughout my whole life and it wasn\u2019t that shocking to me, or some major deal breaker that he had some kind of record or a street name.\n\nSo ofc when I tell my closest friends that i finally had sex, they all wanna play detective and find everything there is to find out about him. I told them all about the street name, and finding him on any social media was impossible, other than snapchat which we had already exchanged. I couldn\u2019t even find his number (and his real name) on cashapp or venmo. So i was like eh whatever, i\u2019ll figure it out eventually until then I just wanna experience everything as I go. Like I said this is my first real sort of \u201crelationship\u201d with anyone, and i\u2019m like we all gotta start somewhere so let me not ruin a good thing yk?\n\nSo this past Monday we made plans to hang out, and he essentially blew me off last minute as I was about to leave. He made some bullshit excuse about having stuff to do in the morning. I was hurt, confused, angry, and tbh embarrassed. So i tell my childhood besties let\u2019s call them PB and J, and we all agree that the interaction was weird, and that we need to know his real name. Like what if he has some secret social media and a whole gf or something. So i\u2019m like fuck it im gonna try cashapp again. Tell me why he pops up immediately and i\u2019m shocked. I\u2019m like guys his name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.  We spend hours trying to find anything relating to him, and it\u2019s honestly really hard. We finally find an old facebook account and an old twitter. like 2016-2018 old. practically no social media footprint after 2020, and his snap score is so low i\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s new.\n\nWe find his exs FB and start stalking it right, tell me why it says she was born in 1990. Im like uhhh wtf? then i scroll and i see her tagging Uno in post about him stealing her stuff, damaging her property, and i\u2019m like huhhh? this dates to 2018, like you\u2019re telling me he was dating an at the time 26 yr old, making her life hell, when he was fresh 18, kinda sus.\n\nScroll some more on the twitter we found, and I see videos from like 2016 of him partying in vegas. like huh? you\u2019re 1 year older than me, and i just turned 21, ain\u2019t no way.\n\nGo back to the facebook right. The Ex posted pics of her with bruises, swollen lips, basically looks like she got beat up. She captions it with a long paragraph that at the end says \u201cavoid \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_ (XX/XX/1992) he\u2019s a 2X felon, lewd act w a minor, grand theft, domestic violence, and 2 times restraining orders, careful listening to his lies!\u201d and my whole fucking body just goes numb like I can\u2019t believe what i\u2019m fucking seeing right now.\n\nI needed to know the truth so I paid $30 on this website for a full background check on him. Everything is true. (accept there wasn\u2019t any other info on the \u201clewd act w a minor\u201d part of his exes post) He has a record, pages long, dating from 2011-2021. It ranges from petty theft, and tickets, to domestic issues with \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d to a violation of parole and more. It says he\u2019s 30 years old, has like thousands of dollars of property damage debt, that he lived in the state he moved from. It had the social media accounts I found, his aliases, all of it. At this point i\u2019m off the phone and i start losing my shit. I\u2019m crying and my mind is racing and like a million different emotions are flooding my body.\n\nI found all that out tuesday, it\u2019s now thursday. I haven\u2019t gone to class, i\u2019ve been drinking/smoking, but just overall like functioning enough to make my friends feel okay. I couldn\u2019t stop crying tuesday. Couldn\u2019t barely cry at all Wednesday, mainly pissed and confused. Numb and back and forth today. I just don\u2019t know what i\u2019m supposed to do.\n\nHe snapped me the following tuesday, that day i found all this out, and also the day after blowing me off monday night. He said \u201cheyyyy wyd today?\u201d then after hours of not responding he tried to call me. I\u2019ve left him on delivered because opening his snap scares the shit out of me, cause idk what to do or say, and delivered feels like the equivalent of being on \u201cpause\u201d\n\nI\u2019m struggling because just a few days ago i was planning outfits to see him, getting butterflies thinking about him, and now out of no where I found out he\u2019s an abusive manipulative liar, not to mention THIRTY? I know it\u2019s stupid but how do i just turn my feelings off, after it was so hard to admit there were any feelings attached in the first place. I know it\u2019s not smart to see him, i know what he\u2019s capable of, and how dangerous it is. So why do i still crave his touch? I feel stupid, and gross, and like i was an easy target who he took advantage of.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see him for what he truly is when he was so kind, soft, and respectful of me. He looks and acts like any other 22 year old. He lives near the frat houses and says he\u2019s trying to go back to school. Like i saw him as a typical young 20 something just trynna figure life out like the rest of us.\n\nI\u2019m planning on going to counseling but idk if they\u2019ll make me report it, i\u2019m not ready for that. Is this a crime? Was I assaulted? Am i being dramatic? It was consensual and i\u2019m not a minor, so does it not matter? What label does this define me as? my head just won\u2019t stop with these questions.\n\nI decided that he can\u2019t ever know that I found out, for my own safety. So if i wanted too I could cut the relationships here and blame it on him blowing me off. He would never know the difference. My brain knows this is the smart choice.\n\nMy heart wants closure. My heart wants to be with him one last time. My heart wants to be held and feel safe. It wants to scream at him for what he did and tell him that I hate him, damn the consequences. Abuse and me aren\u2019t strangers, i\u2019ve seen it happen to my best friend, my mom, so i can handle it . My heart feels like a love sick idiot. ugh and i\u2019m not even in love, if anything just infatuated.\n\nTLDR: Met him at the college bars, hung out twice told me he\u2019s 22. Both got drunk, I let him take my virginity, we had sex here and there for a month. He used a street name, so I couldn\u2019t find information on him. Finally got the government name, found out he\u2019s 30, a felon, and abused his ex. He doesn\u2019t know I know. What do I do? I need advice.\n\nIf you actually read all this cheers to you, i could use some advice. What would you do next? How would you feel? What does this mean for me? Am i being dramatic? Was i taken advantage of? is it more than that? any and all thoughts on the situation are welcome, thank you.",

    "content": "This story might be kind of long, I'm really sorry. I'll keep it as short as possible. I guess I'll start with some back story.\n\n\nI moved out when I was 17 to go to University 2000km from home. I left behind a family life of alcoholic parents, watching an extremely abusive relationship between my mom and dad, and later an even worse relationship between my step mother and dad. I was abused in my 5 years of living with my step mother and as a result of this I have a lot of pent up anger against my parents, and suffer from PTSD. Long story short - despite being a very bubbly, outgoing and happy girl, I have some baggage and some anger issues, as well as a terrible relationship with alcohol.\n\n\nIn the second semester of my first year I met him at a party. He seemed charming and quirky and cute. He gave me his number and that was that. I really didn't know anything else about him apart that he was a stoner and a DJ. Much later on I also learned he suffers from depression (which he won't get help for, and is very suicidal. \n\n\nThe second time we met was a week later at another party (he's in a fraternity that threw huge parties every Friday night). Earlier in the day he messaged me to come and see him in the DJ booth if I came to the party, so I did. One thing leads to another and we end up having sex that night - alcohol and bad decisions seem to go hand in hand with me. That night my friends and I decided to sign up to rush a sorority - why not? The parties seemed fun so might as well try it out.\n\n\nThroughout the week following that night, we messaged each other a lot, and he ended up coming over once to spend the night with me. The following Friday there was another party, and it was this night I find out he was FWB's with the president of the sorority I was then pledging. Great.\n\n\nI confronted him about it the next day, and he told me that it was nothing with her and he was going to break it off because he found someone even better (*wink*). Wow. Awesome, okay. Great! \n\n\nAt some point during that week (stick with me here, lot's of timelines), he messaged me around 3am asking if he could come see me. I was really starting to like this guy so I said yes (naively, I couldn't image why he would want to come over at 3 am...). The next day I found out from a \"friend\" of mine that he had come to her dorm room across campus to try to sleep with her, and then came to mine right after. I guess this should have set off red flags, but it didn't. I think I just go after trouble sometimes.\n\n\nI was confused then as to why he hadn't ended things with the sorority president, why did he try to sleep with my friend, and ultimately why I had to be a \"secret\" - why couldn't people know we were doing what we were doing? It was ridiculous. But I let it happen. And I got angry about it. I got drunk at one of his frat parties and yelled and yelled at him. It was embarassing and terrible, but I was so angry. How could you tell me you liked me in one breath, and in the next tell me that you wanted to be with me, followed by \"but you have to wait because other girls\". WHAT? I think my really embarrassing drunk freak outs (which happened nearly every weekend following the first) are what kept me around. I felt guilty for doing that stuff to him and felt I deserved how he was treating me because of how much I yelled at him when I was intoxicated. \n\n\nFor the following few months, him and I continued to sleep together and hang out, because I really liked him and believed him every time he told me he was going to end it with my sorority president (I know I'm a horrible person, but I didn't know her and I just didn't think). Despite my drunken idiocy, we kept going. We went on dates. We talked all the time. He became my best friend and I really, really liked him. Every other day he was reassuring me he would end it with her, he promised, he really liked me, it was just hard because she was such a nice girl and he didn't want to hurt her feelings more than he already had.\n\n\n\nBut over those months, SO much more happened. I kept finding out about others girls he was also sleeping with, on top of me and the sorority president. Wouldn't that send you away? Probably. But not me. Because I desperately wanted to believe that he really liked me and would pick me over her and the 8 other girls he was sleeping with. Every week I found out about another girl, another story, another stupid thing he had done. I walked in on him sleeping with the president so many times, and with other girls. I just got drunk, got angry, and let it go. So many times it hurts my brain to think about. And I stayed.\n\n\nFinally, after countless drunken meltdowns on him and about four months after meeting him I had finally had enough. I was either going to be the only girl in his life, or I was leaving. So finally he did it. He cut all ties with every girl he had around (or so I thought) and told me he would be exclusively with me. I was relieved and ecstatic. We met in January 2012, and this was April 2012 that this finally happened. \n\n\n\nShortly after we finally became exclusive, he took me to meet his parents. It went amazing and they loved me. At this point I had no other reason but to believe I was his girlfriend. I had met his parents and to me that was as official as it got. But no. From April through to about July we argued all the time about being in a relationship. He kept telling me he \"wasn't ready yet\", and I just sat there dumbfounded and angry because why the hell did I meet his parents and stick around for so long then?\n\n\nIn June I went to visit my parents for the weekend. While I was sitting in the airport waiting to board my plane back home, I get messaged being told that he had tried to sleep with some other girl at a party he went to while I was away, but didn't go through with it because he didn't have a condom (this was a trend). This was just all too familiar to me and I messaged him and lost it. I was so angry. I thought we had gone past all of this. When I arrived home that night, he had brought me flowers and wine and swore up and down that it had never happened and it was a lie from his \"asshole friends\" trying to keep us apart. He was a changed man and he swore it never happened. And I just believed him. Looking back all I can do is shake my head.\n\n\nFINALLY in July of 2012 it appeared we were 100% together. I had met his parents nearly a dozen times by that point, and things were going really well. He spent nearly every night at my place, and things were really great. Sometimes I swore when he came over that his hand smelled like latex, as if he had put a condom on, or that he smelt like a girl's perfume. Sometimes when I kissed him I thought his beard smelt faintly of a woman's vagina (gross, I'm sorry). But I just tried to think nothing of it. Things were good. He couldn't be doing anything wrong. We were really together now. He finally said the word \"girlfriend\". He would never hurt me, right?\n\n\nWrong. In August of 2012 (it was the 17th), one of my best friends called me to tell me she had to talk to me - right now. She explained to me that the sorority president was moving that day to go across the world (okay? who cares?), and that she had met up with her for coffee to say goodbye. While they were chatting and catching up a final time, el presidente drops the bomb that she had been sleeping with my (now) boyfriend all summer. My friend is shocked, since she knew him and I were together. I confronted him about it that night, and when I did he spent the whole night telling me he was going to kill himself. So I spent the entire night convincing him to not do that, and finally in the morning he told me that he had slept with her ONE time, not all summer. Despite the weird smells and sometimes unexplained absences, I believed him and decided to stay with him. I had fought so hard at this point to just be with him.. I didn't want it to end. So we stayed together, under the impression that he had only slept with her ONCE.\n\n\nThings were good again after some time. It took awhile but everything just seemed great between us. At Christmas I told him I loved him. Things just seemed amazing. \n\n\nIn January 2013, I was helping him move. While he was carrying stuff into his new room, I was taking a break on his bed surfing the net on his laptop. I had decided to go on Facebook, go and see that he's logged in. No big deal, I'll log out. Oh, wait... why the hell do you have so many messages from that co-worker of yours you used to sleep with .... And here's when problems round two start. He was flirting with her, and dirty messaging her. He was messaging his ex (who I also believe he cheated on) and was hanging out with her... Clearly I had no knowledge of this, and my trust in him once again took a huge hit. And I still stayed. I don't know why. \n\n\nI let this happen for months. We fought forever. He refused to tell his ex that we were dating and hid me from her for ages. Eventually she found out, but up until she did lord knows how many times they hung out. Lord knows what they did. I found one of her sweaters in his room in March of this year, so they were still hanging out up until at least then...\n\n\nThis was the point when my drinking started to get really bad. I loved him so much, how could he treat me like that? I just found every reason in the world to drink. And when I drank, I would black out and lose it on him. I went into what he calls \"flashbacks\" of scenarios with my step mom where I would scream and push him away and just sob uncontrollably. I was a nightmare to him. Really, I was terrible. I said such horrible things to him over the next few months every time I drank. But despite that he stuck with me and we stayed together. \n\n\nAs time passed I just got angrier and angrier with him. Why had he done that and put me through all of that, but now tells me he wants to marry me and be with me forever? How? Why am I finally good enough *now*? I couldn't take it. So I just drank. God I got stupid drunk. I nearly died a few times and I just couldn't stop. It was my escape and it made me happy and it was something I could do to finally get back at him because he hated it so much.\n\n\nOur relationship deteriorated. We fought all the time. We both worked full time all summer (April to August of this summer), and had very conflicting schedules. We didn't see each other much. Our sex life went to shit - I felt used constantly because the sex never seemed to be anything about me. I tried to communicate with him my needs but he just never seemed to listen. I guess our sex life had been like that for awhile, but I was just finally having enough of him not listening to me. I mean he would get fellatio constantly, but would only perform cunnilingus MAYBE once a month. My self esteem deteriorated and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n\nIn the last few months of the summer I know that I gave up on us. I thought about us breaking up a lot, but I loved him too much to do it. I really did stop trying, and for those months and those problems I do blame myself. I drank a lot and I was just a bitch, and I realize that. He really didn't deserve how I treated him, and the fact that I really did give up wasn't good for either of us. I should have ended it then but we let it drag on. We fought all the time. It was draining and horrible. \n\n\nFinally August 31st of this year I had enough. I called my dad and told him everything, and he told me I needed to end it. And he was right. So I did after we took a week long break, and it looked clear to me then that nothing would get fixed.\n\n\nIt was horrible. He scared me a lot - he broke a fan, he threatened to kill himself. He was caring for my pet rabbit at the time of the breakup and refused to give him back (he still has my rabbit). I was a train wreck. I felt lost and broken and horrible without him, and I couldn't believe I had hurt him so bad. I blamed myself for all our problems and really took them on and just went downhill. All I could think about was him getting with other girls and it destroyed me.\n\n\nI tried to go out a lot and stick with friends to get over it, but we talked every day no matter how hard I tried not to. It didn't help.\n\n\nThree weeks after we broke up he showed up one night at my house drunk and I stupidly let him in. We had sex. Things got complicated. I felt used. The following day I had a drunken meltdown and nearly kicked his door down. I felt awful and blamed myself again.\n\n\nAfter that night we talked a lot and saw each other a few times, which escalated to a few times a week, which turned into us being in our old habit again. Hanging out everyday, sleeping together. It was like old times but now everything was quite good. I decided that maybe things would change, so I asked him to go for coffee with me so we could talk about fixing things.\n\n\nDuring this talk I stupidly decided I wanted to rehash the past a little, so I could have closure and move on from it so we could be better and be together. During this talk he FINALLY comes clean that he had in fact been sleeping with the sorority president for a period of about three weeks that summer (but he wasn't lying because it wasn't in fact all summer). It really didn't get farther than that. I just lost it. I didn't know what to do. But true to my nature, a few days later things were fine all over again. We decided to stay exclusive while we tried to patch up our relationship. \n\n\nIt's been about a month since we went for coffee. And things HAVE been good (so long as I don't think about the past). Things have been better than ever between us, and I can definitely see us FINALLY working. But on Halloween night I was told by a very good and trustworthy friend that he had made out with some girl at a Halloween party the previous Friday, and had tried to take it farther but couldn't since he didn't have a condom (see that pattern? It's like it's starting all over again). It feels like we're right back at square one. He denies this claim vehemently, but has since allegedly messaged this friend, freaking out that I was told this. Well that looks fishy...\n\n\nI'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do. I love him dearly and have given two years of my life to this guy. I have made some huge mistakes and have many problems of my own, and I know I have contributed a large amount to our problems. But this is just ridiculous now and I don't know what to do. He's agreed to come over and talk to me tomorrow since I have asked him to, regarding what I heard. I know he'll deny it. I have a good feeling he did do it, but how do I prove it?\n\n\nI'm sorry this is so long. I've tried to give as much back detail as I can. Please help me out here.\n\n\nAnd do understand that I do realize how ridiculous this all is. We have so many issues - how can I not just end it? But I love him. When things are good with him, they are so good. When things are good he is great for me and treats me well. He's become my best friend through and through. I'm getting counseling and I'm in the process of joining AA to fix my problems as I know I need to face them. I'm scared of losing him and I don't know what to do. But I can't be treated like that again. He isn't a bad guy. He is sweet and caring and goofy and does so much for me. I think he just makes a very huge amount of poor choices.\n\n---\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of nearly two years and I have been rocky from the start. Lying, infidelity, and refusal to commit are amongst these. Finally broke up, trying to patch things up, and it feels like we're starting out all over again. I love him so much but I don't know what to do anymore. ",

    "content": "I became incredibly close friends with my best friend in March of 2014. We've been through a lot together and done a lot together. We've been on a cruise, we've gone on trips to Denver and Seattle, we've gone to concerts, and have talked almost every day for the past almost 2 years and hung out about every weekend. I know everything about him and he knows everything about me.\n\nIn February 2015 he began dating a guy that he met off a dating app. i didn't like the guy at first but I thought it was just me losing some of my friend to him so i pushed those feelings away and tried to like him. It seemed though that every time that we would hang out, he was cold and standoffish towards me and that would cause me to draw inwards and try to figure out what i was doing wrong and why he didn't like me. This went off and on for a few months. I stated to notice a pattern where it seemed that the only time he was friendly towards me was when we were drinking.\n\nHe began to make his conversations with me sexual, and I\u2019ll be honest I have no taboos about sexually and talk about it openly and freely. Though these conversations I discovered that we had very similar \"kinks\" with each other (something that my best friend does not share with him, having recently come out in September of 2013). One thing that always struck me as interesting was that when ever he would talk to me about these things; it was almost always started with \u201cYou can never tell \u201cmy best friend\u201d this\u201d. I wanted to get a better friendship with him and I figured keeping his confidence would do this, so I did. I never told my best friend any of the things he told me. \n\nOn December 12th, my best friend had a Christmas party with him sister (who is his roommate) at their apartment and I went along with a few members of his family, some of our friends and his boyfriend. it was all fun and everyone was having a good time, his boyfriend then began to send me pictures of guys he thought were hot and I also began to do the same (something that my best friend and myself did all the time so I didn\u2019t have any issues with sending them to his boyfriend). He began asking me what sort of kinks I was into and specified that I couldn\u2019t tell my best friend that we were talking about them. The conversation became more sexual and he eventually began asking me things like how often I masturbated and things of that nature. He also asked me to send him pictures of myself doing sexual things ( I complied with some pictures that were on my phone).\n\nA while later he asked me to talk to him and said he had to take a pee and asked me to follow him into the bathroom, so I did. He peed and talked about how he felt like my best friend was being distant with him and he didn\u2019t know what to do and felt like he was losing him. I told him to be more direct with him and that my best friend is emotionally constipated. We talked a lot about our friendship as well and out mutual standoffishness towards each other. After we were done talking we opened the door to find that the party had cleared out and basically everyone was asleep. \n\nLater that night he texted me and began to talk dirty to me over text, taking a dominate role and telling me the things he wanted to do to me. He had me go to the bathroom and take a picture of myself masturbating. He then came in and he had me perform fellatio on him. \n\nIt sounds incredibly stupid and dumb but I justified what we were doing by saying that it would form and strength our friendship and would help everyone be, copasetic I guess. It sounds dumb I know, I came to that conclusion the moment he was done. It was as if the stupid thoughts that had support that stupid train wreck of thinking and left me with holy fuck what the hell did I just do. I was so ashamed of myself. I barely slept that night I literally felt sick to my stomach.\n\nThe next morning Dec 13th, the boyfriend went to work and my best friend and me hung out and played video games. I could barely look at him I felt so terrible. I was so worked up about what to do that I threw up almost 5 times that day. I went home that night and I finally realized that even though it was going to potentially ruin our friendship, I had to tell him what had happened. \n\nI texted him around 5:30pm-ish the next day, Monday Dec 14th and I told him that I really needed to talk to him. He called me immediately and asked me what was wrong. I told him that I needed to talk to him and his boyfriend needed to be there too. He said he was Christmas shopping but he would tell him and he would head over too. I texted his boyfriend to give him a heads up and not blindside him but let him know that we had to tell him what had happened. He texted me later and said he had told him, and that I was a monster and that he knew I was trying to break them up. He later texted \u201cthis isn\u2019t over\u201d.\n\nMy best friend came over a little bit later and I said that we should wait till his boyfriend got there, and he said that he wasn\u2019t coming and that he had already told him what had happened. I just broke down and started crying and apologizing for what had happened. My best friend said that we were not okay now, but that we would be, and that he was very forgiving. He told me to keep busy and do my yoga and ride my bike. He also said that he was still going to talk to my family, for they were a large source of support for him. I told him that I was sorry that he came all the way up here if he already knew, and he said that he wanted to make sure that I was okay. I asked if he wanted the book back that I had just borrowed from him the other night, and he said no that he wanted me to read it. He also said that \u201cfor whatever its worth, you told me first\u201d. \n\nMy best friend was more like a brother to me, like a real member of my family. It disgusts me so much what I did to him, and how I betrayed his trust and his friendship. I\u2019m actually seeing a physiatrist tomorrow to have a psychological evaluation done. \n\nI\u2019m asking two questions: how long I should wait to reach out to him and should I have my old date/friend till my best friend the information below? So for the first question, it\u2019s been 42 days today since I last talked to him. I know from FB that he is speaking to (and hanging out with) his boyfriend still although I\u2019ve heard they broke up. For the second question, I also found out that from my old date/friend to my best friend\u2019s ex-girlfriend\u2019s wedding (the one he was dating when he came out in Sep of 2013). My old date/friend said that my best friend\u2019s boyfriend tried to hook up with him so much that it made him so uncomfortable he left. I just thought he wasn\u2019t having a good time! Should I have my old date/friend till my best friend this information?\n\t\nOr should I just wait and do nothing, and wait for him to work it out and reach out to me?\n\nThank you, after years of lurking this is my first post. Be gentle, I know I made an incredibly stupid mistake but I\u2019m so sorry for what I did, and I feel so much regret and remorse, I hurt the one person I\u2019ve met in my life who has done more for me than anyone I know. It kills me everyday and I honestly at this point don\u2019t know how to forgive myself for what I did.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I fooled around with my best friends boyfriend while drunk and i went to tell my best friend and his boyfriend panicked and told him first. My best friend has not reached out to me yet and i haven't heard from him in 42 days and i know that my best friend and his boyfriend are back on speaking terms. Should i give him space and wait for him to reach out or should i reach out to him first. I also later found out that my best friends boyfriend tried to sleep with my date to a friends wedding. should i have my old date tell my best friend this information.",

    "content": "Hey to whoever reads this. I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to talk about this, but this place is called \"off my chest\" and I definitely have a lot of things to get off my chest right now.\n\nI apologize in advance if I end up making lots of grammar mistakes, as English isn't my first language, and I usually don't write stories that long. This is going to be an incredibly long story, but I just didn't find a way to condense it any more than I already did.\n\nAnyway, let's get to the point. I (now 28M) have been in a really toxic relationship 5 years ago (then 22M), the experience of which really messed with my mind and self worth, and it still affects me to this day.\n\nIt all began in 2019, during my second year at university. The year before, my long term girlfriend - someone I had been with on and off for seven or eight years - ever since we were kids - had broken up with me. That was a heavy situation in its own right, but that's not the focus of this particular story. The breakup was painful for a few months, yet because it ended on relatively good terms, and because I was now living in a new city, constantly meeting people and discovering new experiences in my first year, I managed to not think too much about it and moved on fairly quickly. Looking back now, that time - transitioning from my first year into my second was the happiest period of my life. But then everything changed.\n\nAt the start of my second year, a few friends and I went to this welcoming party for the new first years. The subject I studied isn\u2019t exactly popular, so every year only a handful of people enroll. That makes us a small but tight-knit group where everyone knows everyone. Anyway, during the party one girl from the new batch caught my attention. Not in a romantic or sexual way or anything like that, she just really reminded me of someone, and I couldn\u2019t for the life of me figure out who (I still don\u2019t know lol). I\u2019m not going to use her real name (or anyone's for that matter),so let\u2019s just call her Emily (then 19F).\n\nAfter a while she had noticed that I had been staring at her, so she approached me. I expected our conversation to be awkward, but we hit it off right from the start, which was rare for me, as I was a very anxious and introverted person. But talking to her I somehow felt no anxiety. Eventually we both grew tired of the party, so we left it together and walked back home to our dorms. We exchanged our socials, said our goodnights and went our separate ways. I thought it was a pleasant night, but didn't think much of anything about that girl in the following days and just continued with my regular life. \n\nThen she started texting me a lot, and I mean **a lot**. At first I found it a bit weird that some girl I talked to once at a party was absolutely bombarding my phone with memes, and conversations of a very familiar nature, as if we were close friends for years, but slowly I started to lower my guard down and did the same to her. Eventually we decided to just meet up at the stairwell of our dorm, as we both lived at the same building, but on different floors. We ended up sitting there and talking into the late hours of the night. Our conversation turned more and more flirty (mostly through her initiative), she became very touchy, we had tickle fights etc. I noticed then, that I saw traces of my ex girlfriend in her, and I told her that. Funnily enough she said I reminded her of her own ex too, and that's why she was so eager to get to know me better.\n\nAfter that first night at the stairwell we started meeting there every evening in the same place - at the top level of the stairwell - where nobody usually came. Then, during one of our tickle fights I accidentally pinched one of her breasts as a defense mechanism when I was being tickled. I didn't do it consciously, I am just very sensitive to tickling, and to make it stop I usually just flail my arms around everywhere to make it stop, and it just somehow happened to land on her breast that time. I of course apologized immediately, but the mood changed completely between us. Her chatty manic personality and touchy behavior was immediately replaced with stone cold silence. She then backed away from me. Then, with a voice full of sadness and maybe even contempt she told me that I objectified her with that action, that I clearly don't respect women, and that she's very disappointed in me, as she thought I wasn't like the other guys. I kept apologizing and said it was an accident, but she wasn't having it and told me that she'll be going back to her room, and then she left.\n\nAt that point I thought that I irreparably fucked things up and this would be the end for whatever that even was between us, but in a couple of days she was back to bombarding my socials with her messages and memes, and soon enough we met on that stairwell again. She told me that she still haven't forgiven me about the breast incident, and that it would only be fair for her to \"violate\" my private parts to make things even. I didn't object, so she started a tickle fight again and then she pinched my balls through my pants (wasn't a pleasant feeling). We then went back to our usual deep conversations, and flirtatious questions and answers.\n\nEventually we ended up cuddling on that stairwell like a couple of homeless junkies, and she was laying on top of me like I was a body sized pillow for her. She eventually sat up and started grinding on my crotch. I asked her what she was doing. She replied in a most childishly innocent voice that she was just being friendly and that she's just a naturally touchy person. I laughed it off, and told her that maybe we should just go to my room, she agreed. \n\nThankfully none of my two roomates were around at the time, so we had some privacy. We got in my bed and cuddled. Eventually, through her initiation, more serious things happened, but we were awkwardly interrupted by one of my roomates who returned to the room, so we just called it a night and fell asleep together. When I woke up early next morning for work, she didn't let me leave the bed by putting her hand into my underwear, and grabbing me by my privates. We fooled around, but eventually I had to leave. I know I'm throwing out a lot of information at you, but these things will be important later, so bear with me. \n\nAs time went on, sex became almost a daily occurrence for us, but I should mention, that funnily enough, even though we were having regular sex, we hadn't kissed each other yet, so I suppose we were going through this whole thing backwards, starting off heavy without having experienced anything light beforehand. Then, a couple of weeks later, during one of our evenings we were listening to good music, cracking jokes, and then talking about something deep with each other, and then there was this perfect moment of silence when we just looked into each other's eyes for a couple of seconds, and without even thinking, I instinctively leaned in to finally kiss her. It was a long and passionate kiss, but when it ended, she pulled away and seemed very caught off guard by it, even started panicking a little bit, and started pacing circles around my room and not saying anything. I have to admit that I was quite confused by her reaction considering we've done a whole lot worse things for a few weeks now. I asked her if everything was alright. She paused for a bit, and without looking at me, told me: \"everything is both alright and *very* not alright.\". I asked her why. Was my kissing  bad, or if I stepped out of line, but she told me: \"no, nothing like that, I just promised myself I wouldn't do this with any guy, at least not for a couple of years while I'm studying here. I told her that we alreary did far worse off things and she seemed to have no problem with it. She then started doing her innocent childish voice again and told me: \"that was different, OP, I was just being *friendly* with you\". I then thought that maybe she took our fooling around as a casual thing with no strings attached, and the kiss now finally made it seem \"real\" for her, like something she couldn't easily back away from anymore. I told her that we can stop everything if that's what she wanted, but after a short pause she finally walked up to me again. I noticed a slight smile on her face, but also the shine of a single tear running down her cheek, she looked me in the eyes and told me: \"No... I don't think I want this to stop. But I'm afraid that I will end up really hurting you one day\", and then she kissed me herself. If only I took her warning seriously back then.\n\nAfter that night, things definitely changed between us. While before she was very touchy in a slightly annoying way (random tickles, slapping my ass without warning, randomly grabbing private areas) she was now touchy in a much more sweet and mellow way (holding my hand, snuggling herself up to me, softly caressing my skin, placing my hand on her thigh etc.) She became much less hyper and \"crazy\" too, and more softspoken and \"real\" with me. We started hanging out almost every day, constantly going to the movies, visiting museums, watching Netflix either at my or her room, going on walks, taking small trips to nearby cities, etc. She even took me to her hometown where she introduced me to her mom, dad, as well as her siblings, all of whom seemed to really like me, and has shown interest in meeting my parents which I would have happily arranged had they've not been out of the country at the time. \n\nThings were going great for almost a year, to the point where I remember thinking to myself how strange it was that we seemed to avoid having even the slightest of arguments throughout that entire period, considering that during my last and only relationship we used to have major arguments pretty frequently before we both had enough. Not that I haven't noticed at least some unpleasant things about her, such as the fact that she avoided talking about us, or showing the same level of affection to me when around other people from my study community, for example - only holding my hand when obscured behind a table, or kissing me only when taking me into a different room where no people could see us, while around others. The only people that she didn't try to hide our relationship from were our closest friends. Or when around complete strangers who didn't know us. But showing affection around our own community was a big nono for her.\n\nI also noticed that she had a particular dislike of my female friends, especially my best friend, let's call her Victoria, who was a fellow second year, and with who I used to hang out with the most before I met Emily. Victoria was actually very happy about Emily and I being together, and was actually the person who pushed me to get to know Emily better from the very start when she started bombarding my socials with memes and I was weirded out. She also tried befriending Emily multiple times by inviting her to her parties or just to drink coffee with us in-between classes and so on, but Emily would always find some excuse, and in those rare moments when they were in the presence of one another, Emily would always go completely silent, keeping her distance and would have an annoyed look on her face, which was a huge contrast to her usual hyper and chatty personality. At the time I suspected Emily felt threatened by Victoria due to our closeness, but I always assured her that Victoria is like a sister to me and nothing else. Emily would tell me that she's not jealous, she just simply dislikes Victoria as a person. Eventually I just let that issue go. (They did actually start getting along perfectly fine several years later when they both ended up in the same group when studying their master's degree, so it seems Emily only had a problem with Victoria only when we were together)\n\nEmily would also pretty consistently ask me if I wasn't ready to \"run away\" from her yet, as \"she was going to end up hurting me one day\", especially during very sweet moments, such as cuddling in my bed, kissing, or talking about deep things. All these things seem like very red flags to me now with hindsight, but I don't know, back then I somehow ignored all those things and rationalized them within my head, not wanting to admit that some day things could actually go wrong. Eventually though that day inevitably came.\n\nIn our study program, first year students have to go on a two week trip to do some practice field work, so after almost a year of seeing one another almost every day, we parted ways and she went on that trip. A week into her trip some friends and I decided to visit that place, as it's also the place of an annual festival which we wanted to visit, and also we were just interested to see how the first years were handling their first field practice.\nWhen we came there, all of the first years were gone for the weekend except for Emily and one of the guys from her group, let's call him Peter. Immediately things seemed off to me, as that guy was following Emily around everywhere she went, even to the point where he followed her to the bathroom and waited by the door for her to come out. They would also sit very close to one another and I could swear I saw the same patterns of behaviour in Emily that she would do when around our community with me. I could swear I saw her holding his hand under the table, but I was afraid to come off as overbearing or paranoid, but when I asked my friends if they were seeing the same thing, they told me they see it too. Eventually I snapped and took Emily outside the house we were all in to talk about all this. She told me I was being paranoid, and that all of this was just in my head. She admitted that she was being touchy with him, but told me that I out of all people should know by now that it's just how she was brought up and doesn't mean anything by it, it's just her way of being friendly. I wasn't exactly satisfied with that conversation but I let it go for then.\n\nWe went back into the house, and then she insisted on holding both of our hands without hiding as a way to show that this didn't mean anything. I still felt very uncomfortable about the situation, as I had never seen her acting that way around other guys throughout our entire year together. But I stayed silent. Then I noticed that the both of them started disappearing somewhere, and I couldn't for the life of me find them anywhere. It was late at night, and completely dark everywhere around us, as it was a pretty rural forested area. I ended up finding them sitting cuddled next to one another on a remote steep hill. I got very upset but she just called me paranoid again and told me that they got tired of all the noise and just wanted to go to a quieter place to wind down. All three of us then walked back to the cabin where the others were.\n\nPretty soon they disappeared again, but this time I couldn't find them. One of my friends however did see them, and told me he saw them making out in a secluded area. That's when I really got angry. My friends were upset on my behalf too. I found Emily and dragged her away from everyone for a talk yet again. But this time I was yelling, and asking whether it was true she was kissing him. She got angry too, yelling at me that I'm just like her parents who are apparently overbearing and controlling, that I don't trust her, that I don't accept her for who she is etc. But eventually she admitted that she did in fact kiss him. I had nothing to say to that, and just wanted to walk away, but she stopped me and started saying the same old spiel how none of that means anything, that's just how she interacts with people, that's it's just her way of being friendly and that there's no feelings between them. Then she tried making me believe that I have an antiquated idea of how people interact with one another these days, that everyone does these things with their friends and it's completely normal, that I'm just too jealous and controlling to realize that, and that I was even somehow misogynistic and hypocritical and that I think it's fine for men to do these things with their female friends but not for women with their male friends (I absolutely don't. I don't think anyone should be making out, or sensually touching their friends while having a significant other, nor have I ever done anything close to that). I retorted that never in my life have I done even a sliver of the things that she considers \"normal\" when it comes to friendships, nor ever seen any of my friends doing anything of that sort with their friends. \n\nOur argument went on and on until I told her I just don't want to have anything more to do with her. This triggered her again, she started crying and asking me about what it would take to make this right. Despite everything I loved her deeply and didn't want to lose her, so I told her that she could start by not making out and fondling her friends. She tried to start going off about the same things about it being normal to her before I interrupted her and told her that I don't care and that it's completely unacceptable to me and if she wants to continue having me in her life she would either have to stop, or it's final. I also told her that I lost all trust in her and I don't know how long it would take for me to trust her again, so I would appreciate if she didn't hang out with Peter, the guy who she just made out with. She complained some more, but we eventually came to an understanding and went back to the others with cooler heads.\n\nI also realize that I forgot to mention two very important details, one being the fact that all of this happened on the eve of Emily's birthday. And this argument that we had happened right before 12 am, so as we were returning to the others, half of the people there started singing happy birthday to her, while some from my own friend group who were still angry at her after finding out about the kiss started interrupting the others by yelling at her and calling her the most unpleasant of things. I tried to calm my friends down, because even if I was still mad at her, I didn't think she deserved all of that on her birthday (or any other day tbh). It was something we had to solve by ourselves. But it was too late, Emily had a bit of a mental break, and started having a panic attack (that's the second important detail, she had those from time to time). She then just told me \"Sorry for even being born, I'll just go kill myself\" and ran somewhere into the deep darkness. I tried looking for her for like an hour or two, but couldn't find her. She didn't pick up her phone either. But thankfully she returned a few hours later shortly before sunrise, but wouldn't talk to me or anyone anymore. \n\nThe next day my friends and I had to leave, and I didn't see or talk to Emily for the remainder of the week until she returned from that place. When she did return, she let herself into my room, and we discussed about what had happened the week before. I can't say it was a productive conversation, as we mostly talked about the same things as in our original argument, and I reaffirmed that if we are to have any sort of future she has to stop behaving that way. She said she would try her best and then we parted ways for that day. To my unpleasant surprise, I found out that she was having a party in her room that very same evening, and that besides her, it was just three guys, one of them being Peter.\n\nI texted her to let her know that I knew what was going on, and that I'm just tired of playing the same old game with her over and over again, I specifically asked her to stop hanging out with Peter if she didn't want us to stop seeing each other, and she was doing the exact opposite thing on the same day she made that promise. Instead of texting me back, she went up to my floor, came into my room and locked the door behind her. She then started crying heavily and literally dropped herself on her knees in front of me begging me not to leave her. She told me a lot of sweet nothings about me being the only one in her life with whom she could have a real genuine connection, she said she would do anything and answer anything just to make it right. \n\nIt then occurred to me to think about the nature of our own relationship, how it began, and how she genuinely thought that she was just being \"friendly\" with me when we were having various sexual activities with one another. I realized that if she did all that with me when she thought I was just her \"friend\" until that fateful kiss, she probably did all of those things with her other friends too. So I asked her. Her crocodile tears were suddenly gone and in the most chill and casual voice she said: \"yeah, with most people, though it varies what I do with whom, for most of them I just squeeze or flap around their dicks because I find the feeling funny, but I did have sex with some\". I was completely horrified. I asked her \"if that's your idea of a friendship, what's your idea of a boyfriend, what in your mind is reserved for him?\", She then again very casually and cheerfully did a gesture with her tongue and cheek which implied a fellatio. \n\nI was completely devastated by everything that I found out. I had spent a year with this girl, and I had never seen or heard even an inkling of anything that she was telling me now. I had a realization that I spent that year living a lie. She had been messing around with pretty much every single male friend of hers behind my back the entire time. It then occurred to me to ask her if she even sees me as her boyfriend, or if I was just another one of her \"friends\". She then honest to God told me: \"No you're not my boyfriend, you never specifically asked me to be your girlfriend, you're just the most special of my friends with whom I spent the majority of my time this past year, and now that I'm spending more time with other people you started getting jealous and are constantly angry with me\". \n\nI felt completely betrayed, everything was a lie. She introduced me to her family, we talked about the places we would live together in the future, we even talked about having kids some day, and after all that I'm just a friend? It just didn't make any sense. It never even occured to me that I would have to ask something so specific after all the things we've done. She then followed up: \"I can be your girlfriend if you want it that badly, but seeing how you're constantly mad at me for just being myself, as well as being so jealous, I don't see us lasting very long\". \n\nI didn't have much words to say at that point, I just told her to go back to her party and to leave me alone. She then turned on her annoying baby voice again and told me she wouldn't leave until she knows everything is good between us, and did a toddler-like pout with her lips. I told her that I don't see any way that would \"make it good\" between us, and told her to leave again. Then, she asked if I was really that mad about some party, and that I can come too if I want, as if completely oblivious to the metric ton of shit she just dumped on my brain a minute ago. I asked her to leave for the final time, and she finally did.\n\nI couldn't sleep for most of that night, and in the morning she texted me again, asking me if I still want to be her boyfriend, telling me that she's willing to try and do whatever it takes to get back my trust and for things to go back to normal, though she mentioned that she didn't trust herself enough to be able to stay true to her word for long. This is an exact quote of my response to her: \"I cannot and will not ever be able to act as if nothing happened. Like you yourself said about me, I will constantly feel jealousy. I will judge you, and I will analyze your every move, and if you don't want me to be like this you would have to do something which is impossible. You would have to change your \"communication\" habits from the core, you would have to stop hanging out with Peter, as well as all of your other male friends, and I could go on and on. You will not do this. I will constantly be angry at you, we will constantly fight. Therefore I think it's best we go our separate ways. And I'm not just talking about your stupid party. It's a general issue that I now have with you. Whenever you will as much as talk with any other guy, I will be suspicious and will judge you inside my head, because I can't ever trust you again. You don't even trust yourself with this, you told me as much. Would you actually want this? Do you want to constantly have fights with me over the smallest of issues from now on? Do you want to constantly make excuses for yourself over everything? Because I don't want any of that shit. Goodbye Emily.\"\n\nIf anyone managed to read my mess of a story up until this point one might think, damn that was a heavy thing, but you managed to do the right thing in the end. Sadly, one would be wrong to think that. The worst of it hasn't even started. After like a month of us not talking anymore, my mental health took a nosedive to the bottom, and my judgement started to get cloudy. I really missed her. I really loved her. I felt the biggest of holes in my chest not being able to be with her anymore. I was addicted to her. \n\nEventually I reached out to her again, and ignoring all the pain she caused me, and disregarding what sliver of dignity I had left, asked her if we can just go back to how it used to be, and that I would just learn to ignore her \"side activities\" somehow. This time it was her rejecting me. She told me that I had my opportunity and I didn't use it. It would never be the same between us, but she wouldn't mind staying friends, but not in her old sense of the word, but in mine, so no more physicality, and the time we would spend together would be a fraction of what it once was. \n\nAfter that, we would meet up for coffee or a kebab from time to time, but I would see her less and less frequently. Her whole demeanor towards me had changed into a cold indifference with the occasional fake smile thrown in. At the same time I would constantly see her hanging out with Peter and a bunch of other guys, and the knowledge of that would build up resentment in me which would lead me to have outbursts at her after which we would cease contact for a month or two, before my stupidity would inevitably bring me crawling back to her, then that would lead to us hanging out even less, and then rinse and repeat.\n\nI was constantly having an internal battle with myself where one side started idealizing Emily as a person that she never was while at the same time trying to put blame for every thing that went wrong solely on myself, while the other side made me feel deep resentment towards her for everything that she made me go through, imagining myself as a victim that never made any bad decisions about her. I felt like I was going insane, and this made me into a very bitter and ugly person. I was drinking more and more alcohol, I was gaining a lot of weight, I started smoking, and I was becoming rude and dismissive towards my other friends, not just Emily. And it's not like I could cut her out of my life even during the moments when I wanted to, she still lived in the same building, I constantly saw her being around. She is also part of our small community, we went to the same faculty every day, she was friends with many of my friends, so wherever I would go, I would see her. The best I could do was just to avoid talking to her.\n\nTo make things worse, Emily started a major gaslighting operation about me, to myself as well as to the wider community of our studies. It was as if she just decided to \"delete her browsing history\" of anything to do during the time when we were \"together\". Whenever I, or anyone else would mention to her something that us two did together, or just generally anything that happened during that period, she would just give the most confused blank stare, a shrug, and either say that it never happened or that she doesn't remember. In her mind we were never anything more than our current form of friends. We had never kissed, had sex, or did anything of any significance together. When somebody from the wider community would ask Emily if we were together, she would say something in the lines of \"oh I hugged OP like once, and then he somehow got into his head that we were a couple because of that, but nothing happened, really\". Then stories such as this would spread to the wider community and be repeated by everyone whenever the question would come up. I was essentially made up to be a hopeless delusional person that was making up lies. I heard those type of comments from her and others so much, that even I myself had started to question my sanity, and my recollection of events. And if it wasn't for the memories of a few of my close friends who did see us together, my old pics, and our old chats, I would have probably fully succumbed to that gaslighting myself.\n\nIt took me about two years to finally get over her. In that time I grew to just accept her as who she is and hold no positive or negative feelings towards her. I appreciate the year that we spent, even if it was a lie, before I found out everything each day was full of happiness and adventure. Nowadays I mostly just try to avoid her when I can. She also at least tries to appear very pleasant with me whenever we do end up talking to one another, but she still feels some resentment towards me from the the things other people say she says about me when I'm not there. We stopped hanging out one-on-one entirely long ago, but whether I like it, or not, she is still very much is present in my life, as like I mentioned previously, the community of the thing we studied is very small and close-knit, so even after we both graduated from the university years ago, we are still a part of that community when working in that field, so I see her pretty often. \n\nI wish I could say that this whole thing was just a silly mess that we can laugh about when looking back at it, because it happened when we were both still very young and stupid in 2019-2020, and that she had since changed and matured for the better, but from considering what I overhear about her or see with my own eyes from time to time, she's completely the same person. Completely unchanged, giving only brief gimpses of hope that she's finally changing, before she inevitably shows her old colors again. Thankfully not to me this time.\n\nA year after our \"breakup\" she also found herself a \"proper\" boyfriend who I at first hated, and he strongly disliked me as well due to her not so pleasant stories about me which were not necessarily always true, but funnily enough her boyfriend and I somehow ended up becoming the bestest of friends, even *before* she ended up screwing him over in *the exact same way* as she did me, because we were just having too many common interests and personality traits with one another to dislike each other for too long. We even lived together as roommates for a year some time later.\n\nShe's now on her third boyfriend, and they at least on the surface appear to get along well and have been together for a while now. Probably the longest out of us three. Though it is concerning how low-key they're keeping that relationship, a lot of people in a very small community don't know anything about it, despite them being together for about 2 years now, and it reminds me of the exact same thing happening to me back then. I also continue seeing her fondling multiple men who aren't her boyfriend when he's not around. I honestly wish that guy the best. Both I and her second boyfriend have warned him in advance when she first started coming on to him. He made his choice.\n\nSo now we're finally back to the present. I have gotten over *her*, but I haven't gotten over what happened during that one year, nor its aftermath. I am left with severe trust issues, basically no self esteem to speak of. Like I mentioned previously, I became a very bitter and cynical man, I have trouble feeling empathy anymore, I'm incapable of loving anyone both platonically and romantically, in fact, the more interest or affection any person shows me, the more indifference I show in return. I realize that very quickly after the fact, but I can't control it. I also just don't care about anything anymore, I feel no shame anymore, I constantly make an ass of myself. And I hate all that. I hate my current self. And because of that, I drink more and more. I'm pretty much an alcoholic now, I get blackout drunk every second or third time I go out drinking, I can never stop after just one drink, because it's almost the only thing that makes me think less about everything. It's affecting my friendships, it's affecting my finances, and it's really affecting my health. \n\nBefore I met her, I used to be the complete opposite of the person I am today. People described me as very kind, empathetic, and always very helpful, even to my own detriment. My friends even used to tell me to learn to say no to people. I was happy and I had my life together. Now some good friends have become distant friends, and some are saying the very same thing - that they don't understand how I changed that much for the worse, and hope that I will turn my life around.\n\nThroughout the years I tried seeing psychologists, but none of them seemed to work for me, and I don't have the money to keep trying new ones. Maybe the best thing about seeing them was the fact that I realized that I feel slightly better when I say out loud what's usually constantly tormenting me locked inside my own head, and I suppose I'm doing that right now. Writing all this has been very therapeutic for me.\n\nI also tried to give dating a chance again in 2022. It was a different girl from our study program, and she was the one that initiated everything. I just sort of let it happen hoping that over time I might actually feel something for her, or at least fix myself somehow, but that moment never came. I didn't love her, I wasn't attracted to her and at the tail end of that relationship I even felt annoyed by her. It honestly feels as if sometimes I feel asexual. We lasted for only a little over a month and a half. We broke up because I couldn't show the affection that she expected of me, and our sex life was almost non existent, because I wasn't even a little bit attracted to her. I have not been with anyone else since then, other than a few short one night flings, some of which could have had potential to become something more, but the moment I would even think of a relationship I would feel physically ill and chicken out of it. I have not even made a single attempt to overcome that feeling. There's just no point.\n\nTLDR: got into a really good relationship with a girl for about a year during which nothing bad happened. Eventually caught that girl cheating. The girl said it's not cheating, but her way of expressing her \"friendliness\". Found out this girl has been fucking around with literally all of her male friends the entire year we were together. Then found out we weren't even \"together\" in the first place, and I was just her \"most precious friend\" because I technically never asked this girl to be my gf, despite spending almost an entire year together, sleeping together, talking about future family plans, being introduced to her entire family, and doing every other imaginable thing together. Then the girl begs me not to leave her and promises to chsnge her ways for me. Broke up with her anyway. Then I started going crazy and missing that girl hard. In a moment of weakness I got into contact with that girl again, but things were never the same and she started gaslighting me and our whole extended community that the whole thing we had together was all in my head the entire time and that nothing had ever happened. Then I  became a bitter, cynical chain smoking alcoholic incapable of loving or trusting anyone anymore despite geting over the girl herself years ago.",

There were 2 friends out the group that I\u2019m closest to, a female and male so on our first day everyone was drinking and catching up. Fast forward to later that night everyone ended up going to this party and getting really drunk, me especially to the point where I just remember talking to a girl then blacking out after.\n\nHow everything was set up was the boys would stay at one house then the girls will stay at another till we check in to the Airbnb the next day. So at the end of the night I remember waking up to the male friend I was closest with giving me fellatio. I was in full shock I didn\u2019t know what to do and still halfway drunk but I pushed him off me and ended up leaving the place I was staying at and now trying to figure out what to do.\n\n Everyone in the group was looking forward to this trip and there was a lot of money put into it. Im not sure if I should tell the female friend in which I know she\u2019ll tell the other females and everyone else\u2019s which would throw the whole trip vibe off or  keep it to myself till after. I was thinking of leaving the trip totally since I know I can\u2019t just act like nothing happened for a whole week but I also want to beat tf outta him. I knew this person for quite awhile now and I\u2019ve never caught that type of vibe from him but now I\u2019m just lost. Feel like my confidence is gone. ",
