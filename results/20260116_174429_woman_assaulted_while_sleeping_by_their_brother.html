I need help getting an understanding of the situation from an outsider PoV.</a>
            <div class="content">I&#x27;ve been having a hard time recently. My <mark>brother</mark> just had a baby, he moved back into town maybe more than a year ago with his girlfriend who he’d been living with for a few years. He’s been kind to me, he’s helped me out quite a lot, like driving me to and from classes for a year because our parents couldn’t. He is nice to me, and I’m nice to him but we aren’t close and we never have been close. I’m having a really hard time engaging with him and being around him because when I was six years old he made me touch his genitals and for years starting in the fourth grade he would threaten to kill me and talk in length about how much he hated me. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a six year age difference, he was way older and struggling a lot and I knew that at the time but I never didn’t believe he was being serious when he said he’d kill me. He had unrestrained access to the house, my parents never took it seriously but he would hit me sometimes and them being certain he wouldn’t only make me feel like it was more likely to happen. I did not understand why my parents wouldn’t protect me and they were so focused on what was going on with him that I was being ignored. I spent a lot of time alone in my room, I wasn’t comfortable spending time in the living room, something I used to do a lot of as a younger kid, because I was scared he’d suddenly come home and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get away and hide discreetly enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

When he told me they were gonna have a kid I was upset, and I’ve remained upset. I don’t really trust that he’s better. He’s being nice but he’s always been able to be nice. I distinctly remember once when I was in sixth grade he had come into my room because he was angry and he heard me laughing so he hit me several times very hard in the back and told me he’d come in and kill me during the night. it was the most shook up I’d been by him in a long time. I stayed in my room crying for hours and my <mark>brother</mark> went shopping with my mom and came back with chocolate milk for me. We used to get these small bottles from the store all the time when we were younger, he handed me mine and apologized for “being mean” and I started crying again. He had never apologized for hurting me or yelling at me or anything he ever did before and I think part of me had pictured when he was older we’d have some meaningful talk where he&#x27;d say sorry ( we still haven&#x27;t today ) and I think at that time I realized it wouldn’t happen. And me crying always made him mad too so whatever calm he got being at the store went away and he went into his room and I kept crying in my own room.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of me saying that is that maybe a few minutes later a repairman came and needed to get into my <mark>brother</mark>&#x27;s room to access some vent or something and I was shocked by how kind my <mark>brother</mark> was to him. I’m glad obviously that he wasn’t shitty to the guy, that would’ve been unfair but he went after me for no reason all the time so I kind of assumed that&#x27;s how he was with everyone. He was very capable of shifting his mood to be very kind and astonishingly normal for random people and I think it hurt a lot to realize he did have some self control that he was not able to extend towards me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My <mark>brother</mark> moved to another state by suddenly deciding he wanted to go live with this girl he met online. From my understanding she had not invited him to do this and he had apparently forced her to stay on the phone with him his entire drive there. He had done this before, though I think he had at least planned the trip with the other girl the first time, and that first time had actually resulted in him having a court appearance for, I think, bruising the girl. I don’t know the specifics outside of the fact that he was required to take anger management classes for a year. This new girl who my <mark>brother</mark> moved in with I guess took him suddenly coming to live with her in stride and they’re still together. When he was living there with her I did not have to think about him at all. It was incredibly peaceful.  When his girlfriend came with him to visit, I got upset again. She was very friendly, very talkative and we talked about him of course. She told me that he had held her down and screamed in her face and that he had lied about having one of his friends die. It struck me that he was now going to just go out and do the stuff he did to me with other people too. And not only are they still together but they’ve now had a kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve refused to be called the kid&#x27;s aunt and I’ve refused to see her. I’m not interested. I’m not living at my parents house anymore and I’m in a unique position where I almost get to not deal with this and it’s on my own terms. It isn&#x27;t circumstantial this time, I didn’t get lucky that my <mark>brother</mark> wanted to suddenly move away, I get to not be there when he comes around. My birthday was earlier this month; I wanted to hang out with my friends but none of them wanted to do anything and I ended up doing nothing. I was still in my parents house then and my <mark>brother</mark> and his girlfriend came over, they picked up the food for dinner and they brought me sweets and a gift. I know it was very kind but I started crying during dinner and didn’t leave my room or eat until they’d left. I didn’t think I even felt unhappy but I just couldn’t stay out there at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m writing all this because I’m being pushed by family members to forgive my <mark>brother</mark> and to move on but I don’t feel ready. I don’t feel angry with my <mark>brother</mark>, I think that’s part of what makes them wanting me to get over it so frustrating. He hurt me and nobody will acknowledge it. My parents say he feels sorry but the closest I’ve gotten to hearing that is last year he suddenly shows up stay at our house because his girlfriend and him got into a fight, he was drunk and he burst into my room and apologized for being sexually inappropriate to me when I was a little kid. He said he was sorry for making me the way I am, that he knows it was wrong of him and then he left and my dad patted him on the back and told him he did a great thing by apologizing. My dad did not talk to me about what my <mark>brother</mark> did to me, my <mark>brother</mark> apologizing for it was the first time my parents heard about it and my dad did not ever bring it up to me. My mom wanted to know details about it after she heard something had happened and told me she was glad it wasn’t rape and then talked for an hour about how when she was a kid it was very common and how she’s glad her siblings hadn’t done it to her and then left my room angrily when I tearfully told her she wasn’t helping me. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I’m writing is obviously biased, my <mark>brother</mark> isn&#x27;t some evil guy but I’m not ready to be cool about this. None of this was addressed while it was happening. I would have the scariest night of my life and then go off to school the next day and just try to forget about it. I had nobody I could talk to about it and that went on for years. I’d have to act like everything was cool all the time and I feel like I physically can’t do that now. I can&#x27;t compose myself the way I used to. I was talking to my mom about how isolated and lonely I felt as a kid and she was telling me that it was my fault. That I was a quiet kid and she had no way to know I was upset. My uncle got into contact with me to try and explain why I need to get over it too. He was saying it’s healthier, and I agree working through it is better than stewing in it but I don’t feel ready. I was explaining to him that I still feel scared like I did as a kid. Nobody was ever listening to me about how scared I was as a kid, nobody took the time, and now everybody wants me to let it go because it&#x27;s having an impact on the family dynamic. If my <mark>brother</mark> is finally better, why do I need to suddenly cause problems? Why can’t I just play along like I used to? It’s apparent to me that if I pretend I’m not upset, like I did as a kid, then just like back then nobody will understand what I’m sacrificing. This was always just my problem, I don’t think I ever fit into the family well enough for them to know if I was struggling. I guess I just want an outside view of this from somebody, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and I want to improve things with my family or at the least have a more balanced understanding of what&#x27;s going on here.</div>
