    "content": "Reposting because I hadn't agreed to the rules. My bad, Reddit. \n--\n\nI moved to this country 22 years ago, and met her on my first full day in the States. We were in middle school, 7th grade. I asked her out on the same day. That's just how we did things back home, so I thought America was the same. She's also from the same country as me, but had grown up here. \n\nShe said no. \n\nHormones, cultural differences, appearances, language--i got it. I didn't take it personally but I wanted her in my life somehow. I just felt seen by her when everyone else just saw another fresh off the boat kid. \n\nWe became best friends over the years. She was kinda mean to me, but she at least gave me time and no one else was doing that. \n\nI shared with her that I wanted to be an astronaut and go to the moon or beyond. She said she didn't want me to die in space so I gave it all up. I didn't want to make her sad. Without thinking twice about it, I gave up on my formulas and theories. It took me years but I ended up finding something to replace it. \n\nI asked her out again after three years of friendship in 2007. I took her to her first concert that summer. We got really close. This time she said yes. \n\nI wanted to feel seen. Not based on my illnesses or my \"potential\" or w/e. I just wanted to be aclnowledge and she would at least do that...in private. \n\nIn public, she was a completely different person. Anyone she respects, she gives them their full attention, doesn't make negative comments about them, and is very agreeable. \n\nYet, she treated me like shit. In front of everyone. And I would call her out on it, and she would just tell me \nit was all in my head. \n\nI became more insecure over the years because of her treatment. We had fights, we had aeguments. \n\nI only wanted to feel seen. Acknowledged. To have my presence be appreciated without some ulterior motive like my life had been up until then with my family and the others in my life. I was sick of being known as either the \"top student\" or \"the sick child\". \n\nI've begged for 21years. And in return, it gets spat back at me like I'm the problem. Doesn't matter the evidence, doesn't matter whether the rationality made sense or didn't make sense. I was always the problem. \n\nIt's a really long story. The last two years have been terrible. My mental health has declined so much from just taking her bullshit day in and day out with no outlets. I stopped talking to people because she wouldn't stop complaining about them. I thought she was uncomfortable with my relationships so I stepped away so she wouldn't. I thought that's what you did for your partner. You do everything you can to make them comfortable and secure in the relationship. I was wrong. So, so wrong. \n\nToday, I was in a crisis, fighting the urges to hurt myself badly and permanently. I'm in such a dark place. Waking up hurts. Like being stabbed over and over my your own existence. \n\nShe asks me how I'm doing for the first time in a week after my boss texted her concerned about me. She sounded bothered. Last week we had an argument because I was trying to eat something and she made a big deal about using a plate to eat.\n\nMind you, I have an eating disorder. I don't eat generally, it makes me feel like death. So when I'm hungry and have an appetite, I just need like 10 minutes where my thoughts aren't getting in the way of me being able to eat. I've asked her for 17 years to please not disturb that for me. But she always does. Then she feigns concern that I'm not eating and is constantly pushing me to eat. \n\nHas she ever tried sitting down with me and talking about my food issues? Well she didn't even try to do that when I told her I feel suicidal every hour of every day. I'm paralyzed from being functional because I'm fighting the voices telling me the plan and the best way to execute it. \n\nI didn't want to talk to her today. She ignores my very obvious discomfort until it gets to the point I'm in crisis, then she wants to solve the issue because it is inconveniencing her to see me like that. \n\nBut she corners me and keeps me from leaving the physical space in which we're both in so I can \"talk to her.\" \n\nI was going to walk away from her when I felt the disturbance in the air from this lockbox that looks like a book, that she threw in my general direction when I told her I didn't want to talk and started walking away. \n\nI have raised my voice in our arguments out of frustration, but I have never raised my hand against her (or any other human being for that matter.) when I break stuff (cuz I do, I cope with things by taking apart electronics) , I do it away from her or when she isn't even around.\n\n I grew up in a DV home. I promised myself I would never go back to that. \n\nUnfortunately, after so many years together, we're very entrenched. Finances, jobs, leisure, dwelling.\n\n Ive gotten into my own serious debt because i didn't leave. I rather drown the sadness with music equipment and software than even think of going back to having nothing. I kept holding on to the hope she would see me as a person. \n\nI work but don't have money. I could barely work last year because I spent most of it either hospitalized or in intensive therapy programs to cope with a lot of stuff, including the way she continued treating me. So, I can't just leave to start over. \n\nBut today was the last straw. I don't even think she realizes how fucked up that was. \n\nThe first thing I told her today when she tried talking to me was: I don't want to talk to you because you make everything about yourself. I proceed to tell her I'm actively suicidal with intent at the moment. And she gets mad at me because I wouldn't talk to her. She became defensive, and started gaslighting me that it was my mental health not her. \n\nIts always about her. And I fucking reinforced that for 21 years. Now she's mad I'm no longer doing it. \n\nI'm done. I don't know what the future holds. I don't know if I'll be able to look back at this post even within the next 12 hours because I just dont know if I'll be here to do so. But, I know I'm done with her. For good. \n\nYou shouldn't have to beg for decades to be acknowledged by people who may have done it a few times and don't want to do it again. I've learned my lesson. I despise hope for reeling me along that things would change. \n\nI just want the pain to stop. \n\n",

    "content": "I hope this is the right place to do this, but I just need someplace to speak my mind freely. Any criticisms I try and present to the mods or the sub in general gets removed or deleted. \n\nThe sub feels like it has fallen FAR from its original purpose; to tell spooky tales that keep you up at night. Sure I find a few gems here and there that are spooky and competently written, but the grand majority just... aren\u2019t. \n\nSo many of them feel like well-meaning but amateur attempts at creepypastas, all using the exact same tropes and themes as tales like The Rake or Slenderman. Others try to simulate horror by just being needlessly gory, and then there are the worst offenders.\n\nThese are stories so far distant from anything even remotely frightening that it\u2019s laughable. I\u2019m not going to be kept up at night because you describe in detail your sexual succubus fantasies in story form and then end it with you getting literally banged to death by some sexy devil chick. It\u2019s not scary, it doesn\u2019t make me question anything besides how the hell it got so many upvotes. \n\nEven worse are the action stories. I\u2019m not kidding when I say that I\u2019ve read nosleep posts about a SWAT team battling demons alongside super soldiers that went in for 14 parts. And even just last night I found one where some machismo-spouting caricature of an action hero kills a dragon in a science lab by shoving ice cubes up its ass. I\u2019m not even kidding. \n\nIt\u2019s just disappointing. I remember stories like Borrasca. Stories like \u201cPsychosis\u201d and other classics that made my mind whirl at night with half-baked ideas of vague terror. But now the sub is stale, cheesy and boring. \n\nBut I think what ticks me off most is the mods. Any constructive criticism is immediately deleted. Literally comments that people leave to help the writers improve are getting removed for insinuating that the stories might be fictional. God fucking forbid. As if 10000000% of people on nosleep don\u2019t already know this stuff is all fake for fun. \n\nAnd get this, these mods perpetuate the bland content even FURTHER by deleting any stories that stray from the norm. \n\nI myself have made 4 separate attempts at writing my own short stories to post there to try and broaden the idea pool and get people thinking again. All four times my stories were removed for the most arbitrary reasons possible. \n\nReason 1.) my first story took place in space. It was an existential horror piece told by a stranded astronaut. Removed for not being believable enough. Okay, fine.\n\nReason 2.) my second story was the story of a friendship between a boy and an uncanny valley monster that builds up tension before revealing its twist right after you stop expecting a twist. Removed for not being believable enough, PURELY because it was narrated in the third person. Okay, I disagree with your decision, but whatever, you\u2019re the bosses.\n\nReason 3.) my third story was framed as a letter sent specifically to the reader from 1912 when it was written, explaining how you, dear reader, are actually a sleeping god, and that the entire universe, including all of humanity\u2019s history, has all been happening in your mind. It builds on the concept of nothing around us being real, and the tiny part of your brain that thinks \u201cwhat if it\u2019s true?\u201d. Removed for not being believable enough. Apparently someone writing a letter and then waiting 100 years for it\u2019s intended recipient counts as \u201ctime travel\u201d and goes against the believability rules of the subreddit. This was the point where I started to get a bit fed up. \n\nReason 4.) my fourth story was the tale of a thought monster that exists in song. Once it finds its way into a young composer\u2019s head, he begins to obsess over it to the point of hearing it everywhere and seeing the written notes on everything. The idea was that nothing is scarier than a monster that only needs to be thought of once to beat you. Removed for not being believable enough. This time they didn\u2019t even give me any explanation other than that. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but NONE of the stories on this subreddit are frickin \u201cbelievable\u201d. Oh yeah, I totallllly believe you fucked a demon. I totalllly believe you killed a dragon via ice cube colonoscopy. I totalllly believe that you met a tribe of cannibals in Arizona while backpacking and they absolutely DID eat your friend before your very eyes. The fact that any attempt I make to provide constructive criticism is silenced, and all my own work is discarded makes it feel like the mods don\u2019t even WANT the sub to return to its former glory. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for ranting, but I really neede to get this off my chest.",

    "content": "Hello reddit, I made this account literally a few minutes ago just to post this because my roommate knows about my main account (and also it would be weird for me to go from posting about Mario games to this). Anyways, I'm in a bit of a situation. So I (21M) think I fell in love with my college roommate, J ( 22F ). We're on summer break right now but we still live together because neither of us re ofally want to go back home and we can luckily afford it.\n\nNow calling her my roommate is accurate but it's not really the full picture, we're also best friends. At least I think so. We met when I was 12 and she was 13 and we just really got along. We've been super close all the time we've known each other, but I didn't start to develop feelings for her until after we moved in together. We both took a gap year after highschool and decided to be roommates when we both wanted to go to the same school (I'm studying animation and shes studying botany). I thought that things were just gonna be normal like they always were, but things started to change once we spent literally every day together. I started noticing the little things she did in her day to day life that I wasn't around to see before. The way she pretends to use a kazoo while doing chores, the way she scrunches up her nose and makes silly faces at herself when we brush our teeth, the way she looks at me after she comes back from an evening class and I've made dinner for the both of us. \n\nAt first I thought it was just a crush, and I would just get over it. And I kept telling myself that, but god it's been two years since then and it's just gotten more intense. Sometimes when we're sitting together and playing a game or watching a movie I catch myself just looking at her with the stupid expression on my face (it's happened so often that she calls it me going 'astronaut mode'). I usually say I'm just thinking about something because I can't tell her that the reason I'm spacing out is that I'm just thinking about how gorgeous her eyes are, I'd probably just explode. And even worse, she's a massive cuddler and really likes to playfully cling onto me. Every time she does this it feels like my heart is gonna explode, and I feel bad for hesitating too because she gets worried about me if I don't hug her back and asks if I'm ok or I'm not in the mood.\n\nShe's incredibly kind and thoughtful and I just feel gross because I know I'm absolutely full on in love with her but I'm keeping it from her, and I'm letting her do these things like cuddle with me or platonically flirt with me, and it feels like I'm taking advantage of her because I haven't told her I like her and she'd probably be uncomfortable with me if she knew. Neither of us have ever had a partner and I really want to tell her because what if she actually accepts it, and if I wait and she gets a partner I could lose that possibility? But I'm terrified I'm gonna lose my best friend in the entire world if I tell her and she doesn't feel the same.\n\nSo reddit please tell me. Do I tell her? And how do I say it? I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna explode into a fireball if I keep dancing around in uncertainty. Thanks in advance.\n\nTLDR; I'm in love with my best friend/roommate and it makes me want to explode because I'm not telling her. What can I do about it?",

    "content": "I'm a teen in Philippines, I was diagnosed severe depression at 13 years old. Me and my family are not rich nor poor, we can afford basic life needs. I'm greatful for it, yes. I drop out at highschool for one year to take a break, I began cosplaying for fun even if my materials are not really quality. But I appreciate it. I thought taking a long break would make me better BUT it didn't.\n\nI became only isolated and lost my social skills, yeah I've been bullied at 6th grade for being 'introvert' and not fighting back but this is worse, I'm too awkward now. So school began again new teacher, new classmates. I'm very good at recitation and quizzes. Though I lack in grouping activity because I don't communicate with them for the fear of them judging me.\n\nAs a kid I wanna be an astronaut, and learning the mind. Until now I wanna learn about the mind (not to be astronaut tho since I know I can't do it) instead now I wanna be a neuroscientist.\n\nNow the main problem is my absence in school, sometimes I feel like if I go there people would judge me and talk about me. So I'm kinda absent 3 times a week or sometimes whole week. Now it worsens, 'what if they judge me for being absent?' ... And when I'm at school and I get overwhelmed or have suicidal thoughts I would go to the clinic, and I go there often and get sent home. It's even more embarrassing.\n\nI feel like I'm too weak, I have many scars at my arms because of s3lf harm. People can see it, it seems like they think I'm a monster.. why can't I just be normal.. yes I was blessed with having a quiet soul and having weird interest(not normal interest here in Philippines amongst teens in lower class where I am) but if the result of it is to be outcast then I KINDA... don't want it :(\n\nSo yea that's all, if anyone wanna talk about intresting stuff or our lives we can talk I wanna have someone talking about stuff that's rarely talked about.",

    "content": "Hi\nThis is going to be long and im really sorry about that, but please, read it, you might have wisdom to share\u2026I'm M24 she's F21 (the age difference has been a problem at times, they way we think and act).\n\n\nMy \u201cex\u201d and I broke up just last week. I\u2019m devastated for so many reasons. We\u2019ve been together for 5.5 years, really loving each other and I honestly believe we were perfect for each other on so many levels. She was the kinda girl that I could fully, truly trust and knew she would never do anything to hurt me. And she never did. We broke up because we\u2019ve had problems for awhile now, I\u2019ve been emotionally unavailable for her, never really talking about \u201cserious\u201d stuff, never really talked about my week, day, I mostly kept for myself. She knew that I was like this and she\u2019d learned to deal with it (to some degree). She was somewhat like that also, she rarely talked about \u201creal\u201d stuff, mostly kept to herself. But what we had was love for each other, we would do anything for each other, we were loyal and spent every minute of every free time together (which eventually hurt us because we had no social life outside). \n\n\nThese are all contributing factors, but the main thing was that she\u2019s been wanting to be an actress for a very long time now, and she\u2019d been postponing it cuz of me, she knew I was against it. And she was aware that it meant that she might be going to Hollywood and giving it her all for a very uncertain amount of time, it could be 6 months or 3 years, she just knew that she would regret it if she didn\u2019t at least try. Except for the long distance, it also meant that she would probably do intimate scenes with other men (she would never go naked, or topless or anything like that) but even kissing, making out, having \u201cfake\u201d sex under the covers, walking around in her underwear (depending on the scenes) these are all things she would do if the part was right and there was no other way around it. I just felt like this would go against every fiber in my body, I really wanted to be okay with it, but I just couldn\u2019t, I just cant be the guy whose gf makes out with other men on her job. What really sucks is that she might never do it because she might never get far with the whole actress thing, because it is so unbelievably competitive, so in some way it felt like we would break up in vain, but at the same time, what if it did happen? Is it really better to post pone the inevitable? \n\n\nSo now, we broke up, after being faithful to each other for 5.5 years, spending every free minute together (sure we had lots of different problems along the way, but we never stopped loving each other). What really sucks for me except for the fact that I\u2019ve lost the woman I\u2019ve loved, the one that was my entire world for 5.5 years. I\u2019ve just graduated, scared shitless for the \u201cjob world\u201d, just moved out to my new apartment, living alone (this apartment was meant for us, so now it\u2019s just a fucked up reminder), just ended my first real long term relationship of 5.5 years, and I feel completely lost. Just fucking lost. \n\n\nWhat really bugs me now is that she was really my drive for succeeding, I mean I\u2019ve always had a goal, that in a couple of years we would have a house, car, travel together, maybe have kids. So I had to work hard to graduate, because she was my drive, inspiration, to achieve the goal, I worked hard because I wanted that for us. Now that that\u2019s gone, I feel lost not knowing my ambitions anymore, the drive is gone, shes gone, I mean what am I really fighting for? Before it was a definite girl, house, car\u2026a plan! That is all gone, there\u2019s no plan anymore, the future just went from known to completely fucking unknown, not knowing if I\u2019ll ever find somebody new, somebody I\u2019ll love, somebody to trust (apparently lots of redditers have cheating SO:s, how fucked up is it out there??) somebody to share a beautiful house with (im a civil engineer as silly as it sounds, building my own house has always been a dream, a dream I do not want to live by myself in).  \n\n\nWith me just getting out of school getting into the job hunt (I live in Sweden but I\u2019ve even thought going to US just go get away from here) and just learning to live by myself, and ending my only real long term relationship\u2026this has all been just to overwhelming, I feel lost, scared, alone, loss of ambition, goals, and drive. The future I fought for is gone and now I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never get that again. I feel like I\u2019ve lost the dream I\u2019ve had for so long that I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026\n\n\nIm really sorry for the long post, I just wanted to get everything out, I really hope you got this far, again, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nTL;DR this has all been just to overwhelming, I feel lost, scared, alone, loss of ambition, goals, and drive. The future I fought for is gone and now I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never get that again. I feel like I\u2019ve lost the dream I\u2019ve had for so long that I don\u2019t know what to do now\u2026\n\nAny wisdom?\n",
