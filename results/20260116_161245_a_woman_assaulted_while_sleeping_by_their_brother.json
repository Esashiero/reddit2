I'm leaving out some details because it would take up an entire book if I were to write everything out.\n\nImportant prefaces - my dad is a mentally and emotionally abusive narcissistic control freak who has messed me up big time over the years. I also have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and dropped out of school in 10th grade due to mental issues. I'm ALSO extremely, very against porn, not for religious reasons even, I'm an atheist. I just believe that a man should be 100% loyal to his woman, and not even look at other women in any way (and vice versa). Porn/sex work is also a very fucked up industry in general. Say what you want about that, that's not what I'm here to discuss anyways. It's not up for debate. But it's integral information.\n\nThat being said, I've had a lot of mental health issues starting from a very young age, stemming from ...",

It seemed that most people were in the \"talk to your manager\" camp.  I did have a long talk with our manager but in the end, asked our manager to hold off on acting on anything until I had time to process.\n\nBy way of background, I was sexually assaulted by a family member for years as a child.  When I came forward to the police at the age of seven, it started a war in my family that has never healed.  While my mother took the proper steps to make sure I was not around that person again, she openly blamed me for the destruction of our family and often asked why I was always causing problems.  It was a familiar refrain in my childhood and o...",

    "content": "So, this is a long winded story, and I'll apologize for it, but it's been bothering me a lot, and I'm looking for any sort of help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very close to my younger brother's good friend. We've been close for a few years while. We have about a ten year age difference, and he's still a teenager (18), so I have very big sister/over protective instincts when it comes to him (I've also known him for about seven or eight years). He's a very sweet kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve and has some insecurities because of trauma in his past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne topic of discussion is his recent girlfriend. He says he doesn't feel comfortable talking about the situation with anyone else. (it would be awkward to talk to his Parents, and my actual brother isn't exactly great emotional support). I know the girl, and like her, but I'm not nearly as close to her as I am to him. (And note, she's 17)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a very chaotic and dramatic relationship. She has cut herself in the past. She's...",

    "content": "I am writing to express feelings of shame, guilt, and sadness that I have been feeling for a very long time. From a very early age I have been afraid of my mother. I remember telling her this often.  I don't remember the responses. I can never remember everything from an encounter with her. At a certain point, I would always check out. \n\nAt one point I remember making a pledge to never cry again. I began regulating everything about myself. From the words I said to the clothes I wore. I wanted to hide myself from her. I reasoned that if she didn't know anything about me then she couldn't hurt me. She could hit me, but I'd still have a sense of inner self. \n\nI'm realizing that she also managed to compromise that person as well. Emotionally I feel far away from those close to me. I've had great difficulties connecting to others and tend to hide myself from them for very long periods of time before I tell them of the extent of my trauma and begin to share more of myself with them.\n\nThe tra...",
