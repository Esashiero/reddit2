I tried to stand my ground, but failed. I eventually decided to go into therapy after my second rape. I learned many useful things there, like how to calm my nerves down and emotionally regulate, and I also received tools on how to set boundaries with others. After my therapy sessions, I went to a party, where one of the guys there attempted to rape me. I decided to seek help once again. I contacted support hotlines and I spoke to a mental health worker again. After all of this, the issues continued. I have been groped on several occasions since then and I've also been kissed against my will, apart from touched inapproriately.

I mean I was shocked discovering that so many women were raped or assaulted. The only reason why I was not is that I avoid men because even as a young girl I knew that men suck and to be honest I just don't like many people I am very introverted most people irritate me easily. I have never liked most \\\"funny\\\" extroverted men, popular people seem dumb to me. So I naturally don't have many friends and I like only talking with women. I have never had male friend I mean WTF is that. The truth is your \\\"male friend\\\" will likely assault you, your ex, your boyfriend etc. not stranger on the street. It is completely bullshit \\\"men that you know will protect you from strangers don't worry\\\". Actually these men you know not strangers will likely rape you. The fewer men you know the better for you. That's the sad truth. I don't care about this \\\"not all men \\\" BS. Women are raped much more by amazing",

We went to our local bar/club, which was a mistake. The dance floor was like a shark tank, just drunk creepy men circling groups of dancing women. Just a real predatory vibe all around. I got groped immediately when we got on the dance floor. I was wearing a shirt with an open back, nothing too sexy just an open back. A lot of men took this as an invitation to put their hands on my back anytime they walked past. A full handed grope without any explanation or apologies. The whole night, anytime a guy wanted to get past me, they would grab my bare back and move me in the direction they wanted. Like I was a plant. I can't imagine feeling such a level of entitlement or ownership over a stranger. My partner was dancing next to me, almost in the same space. No one even touched him.

They kept calling him insults and bringing up times he \\\"stole\\\" from them or starting fights. A week went by, however the focus was still on this other kid. They had decided on confronting him. They started being weird again. So I left again. The next day, I hear my brother in the middle of the night getting dressed around 1:00 am. Me and him share a bed.

They kept calling him insults and bringing up times he \\\"stole\\\" from them or starting fights. A week went by, however the focus was still on this other kid. They had decided on confronting him.

I don't say anything and go back to sleep. \\n\\nThat afternoon the boy was found dead in a ditch near our local school, completely naked faced down with gun holes in hi",

          "content": "Sorry for the long story but I need to get this off my chest. \\n\\nWhen I was around 13 or 14 years old, my family decided to move out of my home town and move to a bigger city. So they decided to pick Las Vegas and due to the transportation of all of our items. It drained a majority of our money so we settled in a trailer park. It was an ok area for the price of it but the people who lived in it were an issue. So down to street from where we lived was a 18 year old girl who went to the same high school as my older sister(let\\u2019s call her S)They became friends and frequently hung out at the community park inside of the trailer park. So one day in the middle of a blistering summer, some of my fiends, my sister and S went to the community pool. FYI, it was around 3pm and was filled with adults and little children. So we all met up at the pool and did the usual thing you do at a pool. Like 2 hours later everyone in our group besides me and S were out of the pool drying off and getting ready to",

          "content": "So I\\u2019ve never been much of a swimmer, mainly because I\\u2019ve had 3 significantly terrible experiences with water, 2 of those nearly resulting in my very own drowning. So I have an innate fear of being in water. And I\\u2019ve been trying to train myself to stand water a bit more recently, but today really put a damper in my progress. So in light of the pandemic, pools have been closed so I have lost progress in trying to train away my fear.\\n\\nAnd so I\\u2019ve been going to lakes and stuff, not swimming but just getting my legs and torso into the water. And that\\u2019s been alright. But today I was invited to go cliff-jumping with friends, and so I figured I\\u2019ve been making progress and I know how the basic mechanics of swimming work enough so that I can get back to shore. Definitely stupid of me to be assuming stuff. \\n\\nBut I figured they all know I don\\u2019t mess with water so if I chicken out it\\u2019ll be fine.\\n\\nSo I get there, and I get to the cliff and I see the water, and my legs nearly fell from under me, all",
