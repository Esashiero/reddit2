  "analysis": "<analyse>Both trajectories returned zero results, indicating the queries are either too restrictive or misaligned with how users phrase such experiences. The specific query may suffer from over-constraint (e.g., strict proximity, mandatory emotional terms like 'trauma'), while the broad query lacks precision to filter irrelevant content (e.g., generic pool stories). Missing intent includes alternative phrasing for 'assault' (e.g., 'violated,' 'felt up'), emotional responses (e.g., 'panicked,' 'humiliated'), and pool-specific contexts (e.g., 'locker room,' 'changing area'). Satisfied intent: core terms like 'pool,' 'grabbed,' and 'woman' are present, but may need expansion.<\u0002analyse><modification>Broaden term coverage for assault-related actions and emotional responses while relaxing proximity constraints to capture varied narratives.<\u0002modification>"
