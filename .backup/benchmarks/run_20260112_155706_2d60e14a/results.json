  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks in previous iterations include: (1) **Topic drift**\u2014overly broad terms like \"public space\" or \"aquatic\" dilute precision, while strict proximity may exclude relevant phrasing variations. (2) **Noise**\u2014prohibited terms (e.g., \"boyfriend\") are correct but may inadvertently filter out tangential discussions. (3) **Missing intent**\u2014first-person narratives may use indirect language (e.g., \"I froze\" vs. \"I was shocked\") or omit explicit terms like \"stranger.\" (4) **Satisfied intent**\u2014core elements (female narrator, pool setting, assault) are well-targeted, but **remaining question** logic suggests refining emotional/behavioral descriptors (e.g., dissociation, reporting to staff) and alternative jargon (e.g., \"creep,\" \"pervert\").<\\/analyse><modification>Narrow emotional/behavioral filters while expanding jargon for perpetrator and assault descriptors, and introduce proximity-based flexibility for first-person indicators.<\\/modification>"
