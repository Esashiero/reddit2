  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks in previous queries include over-constrained proximity (e.g., forcing \"stranger\" near location terms) and potential topic drift due to overly specific phrasing (e.g., \"felt up\"). The intent to find first-person narratives by women is satisfied, but the strict co-occurrence of terms may exclude valid accounts where language is less formulaic (e.g., \"he came up behind me in the pool\"). Missing intent includes alternative descriptors for assault (e.g., \"violated,\" \"harassed\") and broader spatial references (e.g., \"while swimming,\" \"in the water\").<\\/analyse><modification>Relax proximity constraints, expand assault/location vocabulary, and prioritize first-person indicators (e.g., \"I was\").<\\/modification>"
