  "analysis": "<analyse>Both trajectories returned zero results, indicating the queries are either too restrictive or the phrasing does not match how users describe such experiences. The specific trajectory may suffer from over-constrained proximity (~5) and rigid term requirements, while the broad trajectory lacks precision in capturing first-person narratives (e.g., missing \"I was\" or \"my story\"). The intent is satisfied in terms of core keywords (pool, assault, stranger, woman) but misses nuanced phrasing (e.g., \"creep at the pool,\" \"someone grabbed me\") and alternative contexts (e.g., \"lifeguard didn\u2019t help,\" \"reported to staff\").<br><br>Remaining Question: Are there alternative terms for \"assault\" or \"public pool\" that victims use? Are first-person indicators (e.g., \"I,\" \"me\") more common than \"my experience\"?<br><br>Missing intent: Emotional aftermath (e.g., \"trauma,\" \"never went back\"), bystander reactions, or location specifics (e.g., \"locker room,\" \"shallow end\").<br><br>Drawbacks: Topic drift toward general harassment (not pool-specific) or non-first-person posts (e.g., news articles). Noise from unrelated terms (e.g., \"swim\" could match competitive swimming).<br><br>Satisfied intent: Core elements (stranger, woman, pool) are present, but phrasing is likely mismatched.<\u0002analyse><modification>Expand term coverage for assault/pool contexts, relax proximity, and prioritize first-person language while testing alternative jargon (e.g., \"creep,\" \"grabbed\").<\u0002modification>"
