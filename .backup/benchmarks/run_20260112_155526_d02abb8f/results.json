  "analysis": "<analyse>Both trajectories returned zero results, indicating the queries are either too restrictive or misaligned with the language used in first-person accounts. The broad query casts a wide net but may lack specificity in capturing the *public* and *stranger* aspects, while the specific query enforces strict proximity but risks over-filtering (e.g., \"locker room\" may exclude pool-area assaults). The intent for a *first-person narrative* is satisfied, but the *public pool* and *stranger* contexts are likely missing due to rigid term requirements or insufficient alternative phrasing (e.g., \"public pool\" vs. \"community pool\").<\\/analyse><modification>Expand recall by diversifying location/jargon terms and relax proximity for core concepts while preserving first-person filters.<\\/modification>"
