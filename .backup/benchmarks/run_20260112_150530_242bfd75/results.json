  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks in previous iterations include: (1) **Topic drift**\u2014terms like \"felt unsafe\" or \"creepy guy\" may capture general unease rather than a specific assault incident; (2) **Noise**\u2014broad terms like \"harassed\" or \"violated\" could return workplace harassment or non-physical incidents; (3) **Missing intent**\u2014lack of proximity constraints (e.g., assault + pool context) dilutes precision. **Satisfied intent**: First-person perspective (\"I\", \"me\") and pool-related terms. **Remaining Question logic**: Need stricter filters for *physical assault* (e.g., groping, grabbing) in a *public pool* by a *stranger*, with emotional aftermath (e.g., trauma, avoidance).<\\/analyse><modification>Narrow to high-precision terms for *physical assault* with proximity constraints, boost first-person trauma language, and prohibit non-relevant contexts (e.g., workplace, domestic).<\\/modification>"
