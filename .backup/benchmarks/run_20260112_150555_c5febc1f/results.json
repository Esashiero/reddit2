  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks in previous queries include overly restrictive term combinations (e.g., requiring both \"trauma\"-related terms and first-person indicators in the same title) and potential topic drift toward workplace or domestic assaults despite exclusions. The intent for a first-person narrative of a public pool assault by a stranger is satisfied in structure but missing in recall, as no results were found. The remaining question is whether the story exists in a different lexical form (e.g., \"creep,\" \"pervert,\" or \"leered\") or in body text rather than title.<\u0002analyse><modification>Expand lexical variants for assault, relax proximity constraints, and target body text for first-person indicators to improve recall.<\u0002modification>"
