  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks: Both queries returned zero results, indicating overly restrictive filters (e.g., strict proximity, mandatory terms like 'stranger' or 'reported') or topic drift (e.g., 'locker room' may not align with pool-specific assaults). Satisfied intent: First-person narrative, female author, and pool context. Missing intent: Broader emotional reactions (e.g., 'trauma', 'violated'), alternative phrasing for 'stranger' (e.g., 'someone I didn\u2019t know'), and less rigid proximity for actions (e.g., 'grabbed me' vs. 'grabbed' AND 'me').<\\/analyse><modification>Relax proximity constraints, expand emotional/behavioral terms, and introduce alternative jargon for 'stranger' while maintaining female-author focus.<\\/modification>"
