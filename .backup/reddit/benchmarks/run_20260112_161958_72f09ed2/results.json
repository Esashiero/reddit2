  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks: Overly restrictive term combinations (e.g., requiring both 'stranger' and assault verbs in proximity) may exclude relevant narratives where the perpetrator is described differently (e.g., 'a guy I didn\u2019t know'). Missing intent: First-person storytelling cues (e.g., 'I was', 'my experience') and emotional aftermath (e.g., 'shocked', 'traumatized') are absent. Topic drift: Focus on physical descriptors may miss posts framed as advice-seeking or venting (e.g., 'Has this happened to anyone else?').<\\/analyse><modification>Expand recall by incorporating storytelling phrases, emotional language, and alternative perpetrator descriptors while maintaining proximity constraints.<\\/modification>"
