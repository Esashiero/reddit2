Given the Available search features – Reddit Help document, how can the _analyze_results LLM dynamically suggest optimizing other search parameters like sort (top, hot, relevance), time (week, month, year), or even post_type (text, media) if it observes patterns in irrelevant results?"
*   "How can the LLM intelligently suggest new subreddits to add or old ones to remove, perhaps by analyzing the subreddit field of high/low relevance posts, as explored in 'Leveraging Network Analysis and NLP for Intelligent Data Mining of Taxonomies and Folksonomies' (though for PornHub, the concept applies)?

Based on the sources provided, the _analyze_results method can be significantly improved by transforming it from a simple keyword generator into a Reflective Feedback Agent that leverages Reddit's advanced Lucene syntax and network analysis concepts to optimize both search parameters and community targeting.

1. Dynamic Parameter Optimization via Pattern Recognition
The Search Optimization Expert in the _analyze_results method can be instructed to observe specific failure patterns in irrelevant results to suggest overrides in the proposed_config dictionary.
• Optimizing Sort and Time: If the LLM identifies that current results are outdated or fail to capture the "trending" nature of a niche topic, it should suggest changing the sort_by parameter to hot or relevance and narrowing the time filter (e.g., week or month) to increase precision.
 Conversely, if the Found Count is too low, it should trigger a deep_scan with sort_by: top and time: all to maximize historical recall.
• Filtering by Post Type: Reddit’s Lucene engine supports the self:true operator to restrict results to text-only posts.
 If the "Relevance Judge" observes that the search is returning too much noisy media (e.g., memes or image posts) rather than the "direct stories" requested in the description, the expert should suggest appending self:true to the Boolean string. [80, Previous Turns]
• Leveraging Field Identifiers: If patterns in irrelevant results show that the keywords are appearing in the body text but missing the core intent, the LLM can suggest shifting focus to the title: field for higher-signal matching.

2. Intelligent Subreddit Discovery and Pruning
By applying insights from folksonomy analysis (how users actually tag and community-classify content), the system can intelligently manage its target subreddit list.
• Subreddit "Taxonomy" vs. "Folksonomy": Just as PornHub uses fixed categories (taxonomy) and user tags (folksonomy), Reddit uses subreddits as a taxonomy and flairs/content patterns as a folksonomy.
 The LLM can analyze the subreddit field of high-relevance posts to identify "communities of practice"—subreddits that weren't in the initial list but contain the specific jargon found in successful results.
• Automated Pruning: The _analyze_results logic can be expanded to track cumulative rewards for specific subreddits.
 If a subreddit consistently yields results with relevance scores below a threshold (e.g., < 3/10) or produces only "meta-discussions," the LLM should suggest removing it from the configuration to reduce "reasoning noise." [1447, Previous Turns]
• Discovery Mode Integration: When the system is in "Subreddit Discovery Mode," it scans r/all.
 The LLM should be instructed to look for clusters of high-relevance posts and suggest those specific new subreddits as permanent targets for the next optimization iteration.

3. Implementing Multi-Agent Feedback
To make these suggestions "intelligent," you can adopt a competition-based multi-agent scheme within the loop:
• Agent 1 (The Geographic Scout): Focuses on location-based filters (e.g., url:cats or site:github.com).
• Agent 2 (The Content Specialist): Analyzes flairs and post types (e.g., flair:Research or self:true).
• Agent 3 (The Evaluator): Compares the proposals and selects the one that achieved the minimal unresolved requirements in the previous iteration.

Analogy for Search Optimization: Think of your search script as a smart radio receiver. The Boolean keywords are the frequency you are tuning into. The sort/time/post_type parameters are the fine-tuning knobs that remove static (noise). The subreddit list is your antenna array; by analyzing which antennas (subreddits) are picking up the clearest signal (high relevance), the LLM "Search Expert" can choose to point more antennas in that direction while disconnecting those picking up only background noise.
