  "analysis": "<analyse>Both previous queries returned zero results, indicating either overly restrictive filters or mismatched terminology. The intent is satisfied in terms of core keywords (assault, pool, stranger, woman), but the phrasing may be too rigid or miss alternative expressions (e.g., \"harassed,\" \"felt up,\" \"violated\"). Topic drift is minimal, but noise could arise from unrelated pool incidents (e.g., accidents). The remaining question logic suggests exploring less direct synonyms or narrative-style phrasing (e.g., \"I was at the pool when...\").<\\/analyse><modification>Broaden terminology and relax proximity constraints while introducing narrative-style phrasing to capture first-person accounts.<\\/modification>"
