  "analysis": "<analyse>Drawbacks in previous iterations include over-reliance on explicit terms (e.g., \"assaulted\", \"molested\") which may not match first-person storytelling language. Topic drift is minimal, but intent is partially satisfied\u2014missing softer phrasing (e.g., \"unwanted attention\", \"made me uncomfortable\") and spatial context (e.g., \"in the water\", \"while changing\"). Remaining Question: Are victims using euphemisms or situational details instead of direct assault terminology?<\\/analyse><modification>Expand vocabulary to include implicit assault descriptions and pool-specific scenarios while tightening proximity for narrative coherence.<\\/modification>"
