I'm trying to find the courage to send this to him, but I'm scared he won't \"get it.\" As unbiased outside observers, does what I wrote make sense? Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this.\n\n>I have an old injury\u2014when I was 11 years old, I badly sprained my left ankle playing soccer. I don\u2019t remember much of the actual injury, but I remember sitting on the sidelines with my foot stabilized on top of a shoe while the coach got me some ice. Later, I remember my orthopedist telling me that the injury would heal, but that I would probably have a weak left ankle for the rest of my life. As it turns out, he was right. Twenty years later, when hiking, walking, or running, I occasionally feel a twinge in my ankle, the muscles give out and my foot rolls outward. I am always able to recover, and I haven\u2019t had any significant pain in that ankle since I sprained it, but the possibility is always there.

My best friend advised me not to befriend him because he had a bad feeling about him. At first, I didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t notice anything bad about him. He introduced me to a lot of new things, and through him, I discovered some hobbies.\n\nAs time went on, I started noticing that he was constantly crossing my boundaries and embarrassing me in front of others. I stood up to him, but it didn\u2019t help much, and since he did the same to others, I thought it was just normal behavior for him. I also noticed how bad his interactions were, especially with women. He whistled at women on the street, made comments about the breasts of one of my best friends, and generally spoke very negatively and objectifyingly about women.\n\nAs I became more aware of these negative behaviors, I tried several times to confront him about these issues, but he was never willing to admit fault or change his behavior. So I slowly started to distance myself from him to protect myself. During this time, others also began distancing themselves from him.\n\nI talked to some people and then found out that he had stolen fire extinguishers from public buildings multiple times just to spray them for fun. I also found out that he had been involved in several fights and had even beaten up one of his friends.\n\nThen I started dating a girl, and I often vented my frustrations about him to her. He used to tell a story about getting a blowjob behind a festival tent, always saying that it didn\u2019t feel right and was kind of weird. When I complained about him to this girl again, she said that she knew him too\u2014and then she told exactly the same story, but from her perspective:\n\nShe said that he forced her to drink a lot of alcohol, and when she was drunk and could barely stand, he took her behind the tent, pulled out his penis, and forced it into her mouth.

But I'm really in need of some help so if you guys have any advice I would love to hear it. \n\nBasically, I was in college a few years ago and was raped a handful of times by different people. One particular time stands out in my mind when I had gone to a party with my friends and gotten so drunk that I passed out and my friends propped me up against a wall. Long story short, a guy who was two years younger than me found me and took me to an upstairs stairwell where he raped my lifeless body and tried to force fellatio in a way that made me vomit on his penis. On the way home I have memories of him telling me that he didn't use protection but if I needed an abortion to let him know. This was only one instance, but I don't think anything in my life has ever made me want to die more than putting the pieces together of what he had done to me that night. \n\nFast forward, I am out of college now. I fell in love with my soulmate and we moved across the country together where I now attend post-graduate school and we are extremely happy together. He is the most amazing person I will ever know, and I feel fulfilled and grateful for our love in every moment. He knows and is understanding about what happened to me sexually in the past. I have no reservations with him and we have a very healthy relationship. It has been 3 or 4 years since the \"stair guy\" incident. \n\nHowever, lately I have been having rushing feelings of extreme rage and desperate sadness towards that incident and that guy in particular. Maybe it's because I know that he's out ther in the world living amongst his friends and family who have no idea that he is my biggest nightmare. Maybe it's that he totally got away with what he did to me, and he probably never thinks of it or feels any responsibility. Maybe it's that I see in our culture ideas that",

She's also from the same country as me, but had grown up here. \n\nShe said no. \n\nHormones, cultural differences, appearances, language--i got it. I didn't take it personally but I wanted her in my life somehow. I just felt seen by her when everyone else just saw another fresh off the boat kid. \n\nWe became best friends over the years. She was kinda mean to me, but she at least gave me time and no one else was doing that. \n\nI shared with her that I wanted to be an astronaut and go to the moon or beyond. She said she didn't want me to die in space so I gave it all up. I didn't want to make her sad. Without thinking twice about it, I gave up on my formulas and theories. It took me years but I ended up finding something to replace it. \n\nI asked her out again after three years of friendship in 2007. I took her to her first concert that summer. We got really close. This time she said yes. \n\nI wanted to feel seen. Not based on my illnesses or my \"potential\" or w/e. I just wanted to be aclnowledge and she would at least do that...in private. \n\nIn public, she was a completely different person. Anyone she respects, she gives them their full attention, doesn't make negative comments about them, and is very agreeable. \n\nYet, she treated me like shit. In front of everyone. And I would call her out on it, and she would just tell me \nit was all in my head. \n\nI became more insecure over the years because of her treatment. We had fights, we had aeguments. \n\nI only wanted to feel seen. Acknowledged. To have my presence be appreciated without some ulterior motive like my life had been up until then with my family and the others in my life. I was sick of being known as either the \"top student",

    "content": "I hope this is the right place to do this, but I just need someplace to speak my mind freely. Any criticisms I try and present to the mods or the sub in general gets removed or deleted. \n\nThe sub feels like it has fallen FAR from its original purpose; to tell spooky tales that keep you up at night. Sure I find a few gems here and there that are spooky and competently written, but the grand majority just... aren\u2019t. \n\nSo many of them feel like well-meaning but amateur attempts at creepypastas, all using the exact same tropes and themes as tales like The Rake or Slenderman. Others try to simulate horror by just being needlessly gory, and then there are the worst offenders.\n\nThese are stories so far distant from anything even remotely frightening that it\u2019s laughable. I\u2019m not going to be kept up at night because you describe in detail your sexual succubus fantasies in story form and then end it with you getting literally banged to death by some sexy devil chick. It\u2019s not scary, it doesn\u2019t make me question anything besides how the hell it got so many upvotes. \n\nEven worse are the action stories. I\u2019m not kidding when I say that I\u2019ve read nosleep posts about a SWAT team battling demons alongside super soldiers that went in for 14 parts. And even just last night I found one where some machismo-spouting caricature of an action hero kills a dragon in a science lab by shoving ice cubes up its ass. I\u2019m not even kidding. \n\nIt\u2019s just disappointing. I remember stories like Borrasca. Stories like \u201cPsychosis\u201d and other classics that made my mind whirl at night with half-baked ideas of vague terror. But now the sub is stale, cheesy and boring. \n\nBut I think what ticks me off most is the mods. Any constructive criticism is immediately deleted. Literally comments that people leave to help the writers improve are getting removed for insinuating that the stories might be fictional. God fucking forbid. As if 10000000% of people on nosleep don\u2019t already know this stuff is all fake for fun. ",

    "content": "So I have to start with a little background.  I was raised with a very strong appreciation for science, stars, etc. We'd spend weekends as a kid with my telescope at the local observatory looking at the stars. Watching star wars, star trek, star gate, and Cosmos like TV shows (to name a few) were the kinda stuff I grew up on. For instance, on vacations,  instead of going to Disney world, we'd first go to see the Saturn rockets for my brother and I to marvel at. To this day my favorite actor is Tom hanks, and I watched Apollo 13 religiously. Heck I went to space camp... One of those kids that could site you the exact compositions of the sun. Real geeky stuff.  Heck for a college major, I chose a science direction because of my upbringing. \n\nAs for my current relationship: my gf, let's call her C. C is genuine, kind, sweet, cute, very innocent(Catholic school good girl), and most importantly open and honest. She is more into girly things, like Princess movies(no scary stuff allowed), clothes, jewelry, and the occasional gossip as opposed to deeper intellectual pursuits. So while she wasn't at all into science and knowledge as much as I was, she was very into art and has a very good side gig with her photography business(and I'll admit she takes really great one of a kind photos) and I appreciated and respected her for that. Plus she is fun and our conversations, despite being rather superficial, tend to be light hearted and entertaining. That being the case, I rarely delve into science talk, or discussion in the upcoming star wars movie because of her waning interest. normally if I talk about anything in detail I just get a blank stare that says \"I love that you're trying to talk to me about this but, it's Greek to me OP\" or \"you must be real fun at parties.\"  Although lately I have been missing the ability to have deeper conversations than who said what.  But it's something I'm fine with as I have plenty of friends who share my enthusiasm for these topics. \n\nFast for",
